Even under the conditions of sufficient oxygen, they produce energy by a high rate of glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, which is known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with one of the highest incidence and mortality rates in the world at present. However, the exact mechanisms underlying lung cancer development remain unclear. The three key enzymes of glycolysis are hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase. Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the transfer of pyruvate to lactate. All four enzymes have been reported to be overexpressed in tumors, including lung cancer, and can be regulated by many oncoproteins to promote tumor proliferation, migration, and metastasis with dependence or independence of glycolysis. The discovery of aerobic glycolysis in the 1920s has provided new means and potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b6d","authors":["Xue-bing Li","Jun-dong Gu","Qing-hua Zhou"],"doi":"10.1111\/1759-7714.12148","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T17:32:38+00:00","issns":["17597706"],"issue":"1","journal":"Thoracic Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1507037071,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26273330","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4448463\/"],"pmid":"26273330","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","startpage":"17","title":"Review of aerobic glycolysis and its key enzymes - new targets for lung cancer therapy","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-aerobic-glycolysis-key-enzymes-new-targets-lung-cancer-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":1,"1d":1,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8464917,"mean":7.1091894537326,"rank":4524617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2358589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8464917,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247334,"mean":12.689760824475,"rank":137378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":87018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247334,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":1.3670354609929,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.35,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
