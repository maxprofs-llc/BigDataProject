Biodegradation removed 97.7% of 2kg\/ha ATZ yearly applications in the root zone, but removal substantially decreased at increasing depths; dechlorination removed 79% of ATZ in aerobic conditions and 18% in anaerobic conditions, whereas deethylation and oxidation removed only 0.11% and 0.15% of ATZ, respectively. The residual Cl mass fraction in ATZ and 4 byproducts was 2.4% of the applied mass. ATZ half-life ranged from 150 to 247days in the soil surface. ATZ reached 5m soil depth within 200years and its concentration increased from 1\u00d710(-6) to 4\u00d710(-6)mg\/kgdry-soil over time. The correlation between ATZ specific biomass degradation affinity \u03a60 and half-life t1\/2, although relatively uncertain for both hydrolyzing and oxidizing bacteria, suggested that microorganisms with high \u03a60 led to low ATZ t1\/2. Greater ATZ applications were balanced by small nonlinear increments of ATZ biodegraded fraction within the root zone and therefore less ATZ leached into the shallow aquifer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d34","authors":["Cecilia, Daniele la","Maggi, Federico","Daniele la Cecilia","Federico Maggi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jconhyd.2017.05.004","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T15:26:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0169-7722","01697722","1873-6009"],"journal":"Journal of Contaminant Hydrology","last_mentioned_on":1501416308,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016977221730044X?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email&sf85370420=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016977221730044X?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email&sf85370759=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28754243?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28754243","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"In-situ atrazine biodegradation dynamics in wheat ( Triticum ) crops under variable hydrologic regime","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":4415348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2309613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239610,"mean":12.034687278024,"rank":131973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239610,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257,"mean":2.358984375,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AgriPlantSoil\/statuses\/872474740157546496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20880669],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T15:26:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Agri, Plant & Soil","url":"http:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/agriculture","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877088015453224961\/vsS4bDGW_normal.jpg","description":"Official page for Elsevier Agricultural, Plant and Soil Sciences.
