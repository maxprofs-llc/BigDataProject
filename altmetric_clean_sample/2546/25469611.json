Data were analyzed for hospitalizations for all diagnoses, diagnoses of respiratory or cardiovascular disease (ICD9 390-519), and influenza or pneumonia (ICD9480-487), with data stratified by age. The 2009-2010 pandemic influenza season was excluded.\nRates of monthly hospitalizations and hospitalization days for all diagnoses were 4.8% and 8% higher, respectively, during influenza seasons as compared with the summers. The mean LOS per hospitalization for all diagnoses demonstrated a small increase during influenza seasons as compared with summer seasons. The excess hospitalizations and hospitalization days were especially noticed for the age groups under 1 year, 1-4 years, and 85 years and older. The differences were severalfold higher for patients with a diagnosis of respiratory or cardiovascular disease and influenza or pneumonia. Bed occupancy was higher during influenza seasons compared with the summer, particularly in pediatric departments.\nHospital burden in pediatric and internal medicine departments during influenza seasons in Israel was associated with age and diagnosis. These results are important for optimal preparedness for influenza seasons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007cb5","authors":[", ","Aharona Glatman-Freedman","Zalman Kaufman","Yaniv Stein","Hanna Sefty","Hila Zadka","Barak Gordon","Jill Meron","Ethel-Sherry Gordon","Rita Dichtiar","Ziona Haklai","Arnon Afek","Tamy Shohat"],"doi":"10.12788\/jhm.2824","first_seen_on":"2017-09-16T21:05:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["15535592","1553-5606"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Hospital Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506287106,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com\/jhospmed\/article\/145138\/hospital-medicine\/influenza-season-hospitalization-trends-israel-multi-year","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28914274?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Document\/August-2017\/jhm012090710.pdf","pmid":"28914274","pubdate":"2017-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hospitals"],"title":"Influenza Season Hospitalization Trends in Israel: A Multi-Year Comparative Analysis 2005\/2006 Through 2012\/2013","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":1.85,"1m":1.85,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457413,"mean":7.1057140359167,"rank":3805425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4558477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457413,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127010,"mean":12.219913218748,"rank":51624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":73330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127010,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":10.4084612286,"rank":709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":6.7416666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHospMedicine\/statuses\/909161244581679104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25469611],"posted_on":"2017-09-16T21:05:06+00:00","author":{"name":"J Hospital Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/819379494712508417\/ON6PuP1f_normal.jpg","description":"Premier peer-reviewed publication for Hospital Medicine & the official journal for Society of Hospital Medicine.
