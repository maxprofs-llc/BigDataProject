Glycyrrhizin, the primary active compound, has been shown to suppress elevations in liver enzymes that occur when the liver becomes diseased or damaged. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated the hepatoprotective effects of a proprietary glycyrrhizin product during alcohol consumption. Twelve healthy individuals (six male and six female subjects) in a clinic setting consumed vodka nightly for 12\u2009days with the glycyrrhizin product or placebo (blank control), achieving a blood alcohol level of 0.12%. Liver function enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase and serum reduced glutathione were measured at overnight visits 1, 6, and 12. In the alcohol only group, AST, ALT, and GGT significantly increased from baseline (overnight visit 1) to overnight visit 12. In the active group, no statistically significant increases were observed for AST, ALT, and GGT, while alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased and plasma glutathione decreased relative to the alcohol control group. These results suggest that consumption of the proprietary glycyrrhizin study product during alcohol consumption may support improved liver health compared with drinking alcohol alone.
