The one-dimensional (1D) Si:P nanowires are of particular interest, which retain exceptional conductivity down to the atomic scale, and predicted as interconnects for a scalable silicon-based quantum computer. Here we show that ultra-thin Si:P nanowires form one of the most stable electrical conductors, with the phenomenological Hooge parameter of low-frequency noise as low as \u223c10(-8) at 4.2 K, nearly three orders of magnitude lower than even carbon nanotube-based 1D conductors.. An in-built isolation from the surface charge fluctuations due to encapsulation of the wires within the epitaxial Si matrix is the dominant cause for the observed suppression of noise. Apart from quantum information technology, our results confirm the promising prospects for precision-doped Si:P structures in atomic-scale circuitry for the 11 nanometer technology node and beyond.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Saquib Shamim","Shamim, Saquib","Weber, Bent","Thompson, Daniel Wilkinson","Simmons, Michelle Y","Ghosh, Arindam"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b02513","endpage":"5784","first_seen_on":"2016-08-24T19:10:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-6992","1530-6984"],"issue":"9","journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1476894721,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b02513?ref=tw&hootPostID=dde92eb1a7a8eeca2fb66533493cb817","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.nanolett.6b02513"],"pmid":"27525390","pubdate":"2016-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5779","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Ultralow-Noise Atomic-Scale Structures for Quantum Circuitry in Silicon","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultralownoise-atomicscale-structures-quantum-circuitry-silicon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":774516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6774823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245238,"mean":12.179798121817,"rank":39106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":205389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245238,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4066,"mean":11.751419434194,"rank":981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4066,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239,"mean":13.506201680672,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
