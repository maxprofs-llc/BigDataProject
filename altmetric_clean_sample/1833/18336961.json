Every cell biologist learns about it at some point during his or her education, and the beauty of this process has led many of us to go deeper and make it the topic of our research. Great progress has been made toward elucidating the mechanisms of CME, and the field is becoming increasingly complex, with several hundred new publications every year. This makes it easy to get lost in the vast amount of literature and forget about the fundamentals of the field, which are based on the careful interpretation of simple observations made >40 years ago, as exemplified by a study performed by Anderson, Brown, and Goldstein in 1977. We examine how this seminal study was pivotal to our understanding of CME and its progression into ever-increasing complexity over the past four decades.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Maib, Hannes","Smythe, Elizabeth","Ayscough, Kathryn","Hannes Maib","Elizabeth Smythe","Kathryn Ayscough"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e16-04-0213","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T05:55:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1059-1524","1939-4586"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1492370173,"links":["http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/28\/7\/843.full","http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/28\/7\/843.abstract","http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/28\/7\/843.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/28\/7\/843.full.pdf","pmid":"28360213","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Forty years on: clathrin-coated pits continue to fascinate","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forty-years-clathrincoated-pits-continue-fascinate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":5.2,"6m":5.2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192546,"mean":6.9256712767459,"rank":1529193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6656119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192546,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240448,"mean":13.217885646317,"rank":63113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":176949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240448,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2615,"mean":3.5752172915073,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":2277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2615,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.8053513513514,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
