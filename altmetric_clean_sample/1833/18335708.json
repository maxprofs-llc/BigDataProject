At this time the literature exploring this symptom is limited, and to our knowledge very few cases have been described in the child and adolescent population. We report here the cases of one child and one adolescent presenting with significant weight loss, food restriction and fear of vomiting. The child's fear of vomiting masked a concurrent desire to achieve fitness and weight loss, which was uncovered following weight restoration. The adolescent patient, although significantly underweight and food avoidant, also expressed no concerns with body image, until weight restored. The history, course in hospital and management of these patients is discussed, along with several challenges that complicated the diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040fe","authors":["Maertens, Charlotte","Couturier, Jennifer","Grant, Christina","Johnson, Natasha","Charlotte Maertens","Jennifer Couturier","Christina
