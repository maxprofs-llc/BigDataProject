In this work, a thin Fe2 TiO5 layer was decorated on nanostructured hematite nanoflake and nanocoral photoanodes (by thermal oxidation of iron foils) by a facile water-based solution method. Photoelectrochemical measurements show that the Fe2 O3 \/Fe2 TiO5 heterostructure exhibits an obvious enhancement in photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance compared to the pristine hematite. For example, at 1.23\u2005V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE ) in 1\u2009m KOH under AM\u20091.5\u2009G (100\u2005mW\u2009cm(-2) ) illumination, a 4-8\u00d7 increase in the water oxidation photocurrent is achieved for Fe2 O3 \/Fe2 TiO5 , and a considerable cathodic shift of the onset potential up to 0.53-0.62\u2005VRHE is obtained. Moreover, the performance of the Fe2 O3 \/Fe2 TiO5 heterostructure can be further improved by decoration with a SnOx layer. The enhancement in photocurrent can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe2 TiO5 \/SnOx overlayers passivating surface states, and thus reducing surface electron-hole recombination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Wang, Lei","Nguyen, Nhat Truong","Schmuki, Patrik"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201600462","endpage":"2053","first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T10:39:50+00:00","issns":["1864-564X"],"issue":"16","journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1467048890,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cssc.201600462"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201600462\/pdf","pmid":"27348809","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2048","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Facile Surface Passivation of Hematite Photoanodes with Iron Titanate Cocatalyst for Enhanced Water Splitting","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-surface-passivation-hematite-photoanodes-iron-titanate-cocatalyst-enhanced-water-splitting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":6029262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1070186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257650,"mean":12.07492009672,"rank":178265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":48998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257650,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1735,"mean":2.8075201845444,"rank":850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1735,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":3.6858106508876,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
