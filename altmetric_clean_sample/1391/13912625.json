However, there has been no consensus about the standard occiput to C2 fixation in literature and few reports exist about the effects of additional intervening rigid C1LMS on the biomechanics. The role of biomechanics of the addition of C1LMS in occipitoatlantoaxial fixation for fusion is not known.\nA nonlinear finite element model (FEM) of the intact upper cervical spine had been developed and validated. Then a FEM of an unstable model treated with occipital plate combined with C2PS and C1LMS fixation (C1LMS+C2PS+Plate), was compared to that with C2PS fixation (C2PS+Plate). Vertical load of 50\u200aN was applied on the C0, to simulate head weight and 1.5 Nm torque was applied to the C0 to simulate flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation.\nCompared with C2PS+Plate, the C1LMS+C2PS+Plate reduced the range of motion of C0-C2 segment by 3.0%, 35.4%, 29.2%, and 56.9% in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, respectively and it also led to lower occipital screw and superior rod stresses in all loading conditions.\nThe addition of supplemental C1LMS to occiput-C2 fixation not only enhances greater stability, especially during axial rotation, but also has the capability of distributing the stress evenly and reduces the risk of construct failure because of occipital screw pullout and rod fracture. Therefore, this method may be important to elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis and it may promote a high occipitoatlantoaxial fusion rate.\nN\/A.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Liu, Haibo","Zhang, Baocheng","Lei, Jianyin","Cai, Xianhua","Li, Zhiqiang","Wang, Zhihua"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000001637","endpage":"E1318","first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T08:07:27+00:00","issns":["1528-1159","0362-2436"],"issue":"22","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1479888432,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2016\/11150\/Biomechanical_Role_of_the_C1_Lateral_Mass_Screws.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/2016\/11150\/Biomechanical_Role_of_the_C1_Lateral_Mass_Screws.4.pdf","pmid":"27120058","pubdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E1312","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Biomechanical Role of the C1 Lateral Mass Screws in Occipitoatlantoaxial Fixation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/11150\/Biomechanical_Role_of_the_C1_Lateral_Mass_Screws.4.aspx","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomechanical-role-c1-lateral-mass-screws-occipitoatlantoaxial-fixation-finite-element-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":6687147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248095,"mean":12.164332132175,"rank":200835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248095,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4483,"mean":5.778765729585,"rank":3300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4483,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":9.3139175257732,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
