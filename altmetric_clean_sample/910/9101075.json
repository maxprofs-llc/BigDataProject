Much less is known about the role of paternal factors. Paternal education is an important socioeconomic marker that may predict birth outcomes over and above maternal socioeconomic indicators.\nUsing data from the 2006 Canadian Birth-Census Cohort, we estimated the associations between paternal education and preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth, stillbirth and infant mortality in Canada, controlling for maternal characteristics. Binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios and risk differences for adverse birth outcomes associated with paternal education, after controlling for maternal education, age, marital status, parity, ethnicity and nativity.\nA total of 131\u2005285 singleton births were included in the present study. Comparing the lowest to the highest paternal education category, adjusted risk ratios (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.10 to 1.35) for preterm birth, 1.13 (1.03 to 1.23) for SGA birth, 1.92 (1.28 to 2.86) for stillbirth and 1.67 (1.01 to 2.75) for infant mortality. Consistent patterns of associations were observed for absolute risk differences.\nOur study suggests that low paternal education increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, and especially of fetal and infant mortality, independently from maternal characteristics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Gabriel D Shapiro","Tracey Bushnik","Amanda J Sheppard","Michael S Kramer","Jay S Kaufman","Seungmi Yang"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2015-206894","endpage":"72","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T17:49:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-2738"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1481299425,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/24\/jech-2015-206894.abstract","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/24\/jech-2015-206894.short?rss=1","http:\/\/m.jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/24\/jech-2015-206894.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/71\/1\/67.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/24\/jech-2015-206894.full.pdf","pmid":"27343303","pubdate":"2016-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jech-2015-206894","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Paternal education and adverse birth outcomes in Canada","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/missing-paternal-data-adverse-birth-outcomes-canada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":5.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7866440,"mean":6.6628832942016,"rank":1416909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6442750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7866440,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260287,"mean":11.524361133522,"rank":62592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":197348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260287,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2487,"mean":14.168123893805,"rank":920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2487,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":80.726976744186,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
