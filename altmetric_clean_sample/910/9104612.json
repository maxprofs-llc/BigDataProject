Different NSs combining different stabilizers, i.e. poloxamer 188 (P188), polysorbate 80 (T80), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. The stabilizers were selected based on the saturation solubility and IVM stability within 72\u2009h. The screening of formulations was performed by considering the drug content within the nanosize range. The best formulation (IVM:T80:PVP 1:0.5:0.5\u2009wt%) was characterized in terms of the particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, drug content, and in vitro dissolution profile. This NS was also evaluated from a stability point of view, by conditioning samples at a constant temperature and relative humidity for six months. The fresh and conditioned best NSs Z-sizes were 174.6 and 215.7\u2009nm, respectively; while both NSs showed low polydispersity indexes. The faster dissolution rate for the IVM NS was attributed to the presence of nanoparticles and changes to the crystal structure (i.e. amorphization) that further improved solubility. The best NS had a 4-fold faster initial dissolution rate than raw IVM, and is thus a promising formulation for the treatment of human and animal parasitic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5653cf058f610004a8d","authors":["Starkloff, Walter Javier","Bucal\u00e1, Ver\u00f3nica","Palma, Santiago Daniel","Gonzalez Vidal, Noelia L"],"doi":"10.1080\/10837450.2016.1200078","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T21:24:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-9867","1083-7450"],"journal":"Pharmaceutical Development & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1467165084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27346432?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27346432","pubdate":"2016-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"\n              Design and\n              in vitro\n              characterization of ivermectin nanocrystals liquid formulation based on a top\u2013down approach\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-vitro-characterization-ivermectin-nanocrystals-liquid-formulation-based-topdown-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":5753690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1926963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261336,"mean":11.54101358027,"rank":168105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":78023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261336,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":1.1124657534247,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/747903540224397312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9104612],"posted_on":"2016-06-28T21:24:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
