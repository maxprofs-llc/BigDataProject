Some species of the Saccharomyces genus have shown better adaptation at low temperature than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was the case of cryotolerant yeasts Saccharomyces uvarum and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii. In an attempt to detect inter-specific metabolic differences, we characterized the proteomic landscape of these cryotolerant species grown at 12\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C, which we compared with the proteome of S. cerevisiae (poorly adapted at low temperature). Our results showed that the main differences among the proteomic profiling of the three Saccharomyces strains grown at 12\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C lay in translation, glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. Our data corroborate previous transcriptomic results, which suggest that S. kudriavzevii is better adapted to grow at low temperature as a result of enhanced more efficient translation. Fitter amino acid biosynthetic pathways can also be mechanisms that better explain biomass yield in cryotolerant strains. Yet even at low temperature, S. cerevisiae is the most fermentative competitive species. A higher concentration of glycolytic and alcoholic fermentation enzymes in the S. cerevisiae strain might explain such greater fermentation activity.\nTemperature is one of the main relevant environmental variables that microorganisms have to cope with and it is also a key factor in some industrial processes that involve microorganisms. However, we are still far from understanding the molecular and physiological mechanisms of adaptation at low temperatures. The results obtained in this study provided a global atlas of the proteome changes triggered by temperature in three different species of the genus Saccharomyces with different degree of cryotolerance. These results would facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms for how yeast could adapt at the low temperature of growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee4","authors":["Garc\u00eda-R\u00edos, Est\u00e9fani","Querol, Amparo","Guillam\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Manuel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jprot.2016.06.023","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T20:38:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-7737","18743919"],"journal":"Journal of Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1467146379,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27343759?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27343759","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"iTRAQ-based proteome profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cryotolerant species S. uvarum and S. kudriavzevii during low-temperature wine fermentation","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/itraqbased-proteome-profiling-saccharomyces-cerevisiae-cryotolerant-species-saccharomyces-uvarum-sac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":6033113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1070904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261193,"mean":11.542483605929,"rank":183229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261193,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1624,"mean":1.9492556993222,"rank":772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1624,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":3.0530158730159,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
