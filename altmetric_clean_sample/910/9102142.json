ANIMALS 6 healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURE Echocardiography was performed on each dog on different days for 2 weeks (3 times\/d) by 2 echocardiographers. Intraobserver within- and between-day and interobserver coefficients of variation (CVs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for RTXs derived from dual pulse-waved Doppler (RTXDPD), conventional pulsed-wave Doppler (RTXPD), and tissue Doppler (RTXTD) methods were determined. Degrees of agreement among RTX values derived from the 3 methods were assessed by modified Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS Least squares mean (95% confidence interval) RTXtd was 0.50 (0.46 to 0.54), which was significantly higher than that for RTXDPD (0.27 [0.23 to 0.31]) and RTXPD (0.25 [0.21 to 0.29]). Agreement between RTXDPD and RTXPD was good (bias [mean difference], 0.04 [95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.10]). The RTXdpd had high within-day (CV, 6.1; ICC, 0.77) and interobserver (CV, 3.5; ICC, 0.83) repeatability, but between-day repeatability was not high. The RTXtd had high within-day repeatability (CV, 6.0; ICC, 0.80), but between-day and interobserver repeatability were not high. Within-day, between-day, and interobserver repeatability of RTXPD were not high. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE RTXdpd measurement was a repeatable and reproducible method of cardiac evaluation in healthy dogs. The RTXTD values were significantly higher than the RTXDPD and RTXPD values; therefore, RTX values derived from different echocardiographic methods should be interpreted with caution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002221","authors":["Tomoya Morita","Kensuke Nakamura","Tatsuyuki Osuga","Sue Yee Lim","Nozomu Yokoyama","Keitaro Morishita","Hiroshi Ohta","Mitsuyoshi Takiguchi"],"doi":"10.2460\/ajvr.77.7.715","endpage":"720","first_seen_on":"2016-06-28T18:55:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9645","1943-5681"],"issue":"7","journal":"American Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1468783858,"links":["http:\/\/avmajournals.avma.org\/doi\/abs\/10.2460\/ajvr.77.7.715"],"pmid":"27347824","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"715","title":"Repeatability and reproducibility of right ventricular Tei index valves derived from three echocardiographic methods for evaluation of cardiac function in dogs","type":"article","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repeatability-reproducibility-right-ventricular-tei-index-valves-derived-three-echocardiographic-met"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":4040775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3836414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262116,"mean":11.629790183698,"rank":130280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":121112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262116,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":2.7711204188482,"rank":430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.2426829268293,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
