Using visible-light activated catalysts in conjunction with an arsenal of C-radical precursors, an array of trifluoromethyl-substituted alkenes undergo radical defluorinative alkylation. Non-stabilized primary, secondary, and tertiary radicals can be used install functional groups in a convergent manner that would otherwise be challenging to access via two-electron pathways. The process readily extends to other perfluoroalkyl-substituted alkenes. In addition, we report the development of an organotrifluoroborate reagent to expedite synthesis of the requisite trifluoromethyl-substituted alkene starting materials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Molander, Gary","Lang, Simon  Bouyea","Wiles, Rebecca  Jean","Kelly, Christopher  Brian"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201709487","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T15:29:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
