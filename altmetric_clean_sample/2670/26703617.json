The contents of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS(+), FRAP, ORAC) were determined. Identification and quantification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were performed by using UHPLC-QqQ-MS\/MS system. The results revealed high contents of total phenolics and flavonoids. Among the three species, the antioxidant potential had higher capacity in the red propolis. The presence of some of bioactive compounds viz. acacetin, artepellin C, eriodictyol, gallic acid, isorhamnetin, protocatechuic acid, vanillin and vanillic acid in Brazilian red propolis is reported for the first time in this work. Positive correlation between total phenolics versus the FRAP and ORAC methods was established which led to conclusion that antioxidant activity of propolis is mainly due to its phenolic compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028fa","authors":["Julianna Karla Santana Andrade","Marina Denadai","Christean Santos de Oliveira","Maria Lucia Nunes","Narendra Narain"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodres.2017.08.066","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T15:23:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09639969"],"journal":"Food Research International","last_mentioned_on":1506391220,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28941675"],"pmid":"28941675","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Evaluation of bioactive compounds potential and antioxidant activity of brown, green and red propolis from Brazilian northeast region","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-bioactive-compounds-potential-antioxidant-activity-brown-green-red-propolis-brazilian-nor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":7311523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113630,"mean":11.518544121659,"rank":92170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113630,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":719,"mean":6.1211587743733,"rank":582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":719,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.9042105263158,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1834023609960972&id=600854723277873","license":"public","citation_ids":[26703617],"posted_on":"2017-09-26T02:00:20+00:00","summary":"Evaluation of bioactive compounds potential and antioxidant activity of brown, green and red propolis from Brazilian northeast region.\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28941675\n\nAbstract\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the contents of bioa","author":{"name":"Health from the Hive","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/600854723277873","facebook_wall_name":"Health from the Hive","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/600854723277873\/picture","id_on_source":"600854723277873"}}]}}
