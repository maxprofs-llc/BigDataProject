Of 102 children with AHO, 54 abscesses were documented in 46 patients (25 bone, 29 muscle). A delay in presentation was not associated with abscess formation (6.5 vs. 5.0 days, P=0.26). Overall, 78% of all bone abscesses were visible on initial MRI. Consistent use of MRI at presentation may identify children with suppurative complications of AHO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd5","authors":["Johnston, Jennifer J.","Murray-Krezan, Cristina","Dehority, Walter"],"doi":"10.1097\/bpb.0000000000000437","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T16:59:30+00:00","issns":["1060-152X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics: Part B","last_mentioned_on":1506617956,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/Abstract\/2017\/11000\/Suppurative_complications_of_acute_hematogenous.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/2017\/11000\/Suppurative_complications_of_acute_hematogenous.1.pdf","pmid":"28181919","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"491","subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Suppurative complications of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/Fulltext\/2017\/11000\/Suppurative_complications_of_acute_hematogenous.1.aspx","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.5,"6d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":6420825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113833,"mean":11.508051602362,"rank":79733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":21330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113833,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":756,"mean":0.88122913907285,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":756,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.63928571428571,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPediatricOrthB\/statuses\/913448032074469377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26706934],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T16:59:16+00:00","author":{"name":"JPediatricOrtho_B","url":"http:\/\/www.jpo-b.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2898745011\/ae8e601522ca57ccb06f918381ec9b87_normal.jpeg","description":"Publishing peer-reviewed papers on the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric orthopedic disorders.","id_on_source":"JPediatricOrthB","tweeter_id":"972161594","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":232},"tweet_id":"913448032074469377"}]}}
