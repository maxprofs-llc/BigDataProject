Thirty-five subjects were exposed to OC or placebo spray, followed by 10 min of sitting or prone maximal restraint position (PMRP). Spirometry, oximetry, and end-tidal CO2 levels were collected at baseline and throughout the 10 min. Data were compared between groups (ANOVA) and with predefined normal values. In the sitting position, OC did not result in any significant changes in mean percent predicted forced vital capacity (%predFVC), percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (%predFEV1), oxygen, or CO2 levels. In PMRP, mean %predFVC and %predFEV1 fell 14.4 and 16.5% for placebo and 16.2 and 19.1% for OC, but were not significantly different by exposure. There was no evidence of hypoxemia or hypercapnia in either groups. OC exposure did not result in abnormal spirometry, hypoxemia, or hypoventilation when compared to placebo in either sitting or PMRP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["Chan, Theodore C","Vilke, Gary M","Clausen, Jack","Clark, Richard F","Schmidt, Paul","Snowden, Thomas","Neuman, Tom"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T15:47:20+00:00","issns":["0022-1198"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Forensic Sciences (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1322075659,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11908598"],"pmid":"11908598","pubdate":"2002-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"The effect of oleoresin capsicum \"pepper\" spray inhalation on respiratory function.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-oleoresin-capsicum-pepper-spray-inhalation-respiratory-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.736,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.736},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8014601,"mean":6.7724523976199,"rank":1217740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6796446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8014601,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105719,"mean":10.788246542689,"rank":20777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":84942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105719,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":5.433764781491,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":6.6282142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
