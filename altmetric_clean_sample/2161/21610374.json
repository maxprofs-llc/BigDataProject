In this report we compare the basal expression of drug disposition genes and the inductive response of prototypical inducers (rifampin, phenobarbital, phenytoin) in hepatocyte two-dimensional monocultures and the long-term coculture model (HepatoPac). All the inducers used in the study increased the expression and activity of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C enzymes in the HepatoPac cultures. The coculture model showed a consistent and higher induction of CYP2C enzymes compared with the monocultures. The EC50 of rifampin for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 was up to 10-fold lower in HepatoPac than the monocultures. The EC50 of rifampin calculated from the clinical drug interaction studies correlated well with the EC50 observed in the HepatoPac cultures. Owing to the long-term stability of the HepatoPac cultures, we were able to directly measure a half-life (t1\/2) for both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 using the depletion kinetics of mRNA and functional activity. The t1\/2 for CYP3A4 mRNA was 26 hours and that for the functional protein was 49 hours. The t1\/2 of CYP2B6 was 38 hours (mRNA) and 68 hours (activity), which is longer than CYP3A4 and shows the differential turnover of these two proteins. This is the first study to our knowledge to report the turnover rate of CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes. The data presented here demonstrate that the HepatoPac cultures have the potential to be used in long-term culture to mimic complex clinical scenarios.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f61000717a","authors":["V.
