Fifty-two spontaneously breathing, cooperative patients with free-flowing effusions obliterating more than half of the hemidiaphragm on an upright, posteroanterior chest roentgenogram were randomized. When we analyzed those complications that were potentially life-threatening (eg, pneumothorax) and\/or placed patients at increased risk for further morbidity (eg, pneumothorax, dry tap, inadequate tap), the sonography-guided method was associated with significantly fewer serious complications (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (9 of 18) or needle-only methods (5 of 15). The sonography-guided method was associated with fewer pneumothoraces (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (7 of 18) or needle-only methods (3 of 15). The difference between needle-catheter and needle-only methods was not significant. From our results, we conclude that the method by which thoracentesis was performed significantly influenced the spectrum and frequency of complications, and the sonography-guided method was the safest.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002307","authors":["Grogan, D R","Irwin, R S","Channick, R","Raptopoulos, V","Curley, F J","Bartter, T","Corwin, R W"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T18:49:51+00:00","issns":["0003-9926"],"issue":"4","journal":"Archives of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1410496560,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=2183735"],"pmid":"2183735","pubdate":"1990-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Complications associated with thoracentesis.
