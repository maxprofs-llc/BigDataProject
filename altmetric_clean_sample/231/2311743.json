However, recent reports have shown that WAT also secretes irisin and that circulating irisin is elevated in obese subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate irisin levels in conditions of extreme BMI and its correlation with basal metabolism and daily activity. The study involved 145 female patients, including 96 with extreme BMIs (30 anorexic (AN) and 66 obese (OB)) and 49 healthy normal weight (NW). The plasma irisin levels were significantly elevated in the OB patients compared with the AN and NW patients. Irisin also correlated positively with body weight, BMI, and fat mass. The OB patients exhibited the highest REE and higher daily physical activity compared with the AN patients but lower activity compared with the NW patients. The irisin levels were inversely correlated with daily physical activity and directly correlated with REE. Fat mass contributed to most of the variability of the irisin plasma levels independently of the other studied parameters. Conclusion. Irisin levels are influenced by energy expenditure independently of daily physical activity but fat mass is the main contributing factor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e33","authors":["Pardo, Mar&#xed;a"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/857270","first_seen_on":"2014-04-29T09:31:15+00:00","issns":["1687-8337"],"journal":"International Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1398763835,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ije\/2014\/857270\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ije\/2014\/857270.pdf","pmid":"24864142","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Association of Irisin with Fat Mass, Resting Energy Expenditure, and Daily Activity in Conditions of Extreme Body Mass Index","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-irisin-fat-mass-resting-energy-expenditure-daily-activity-conditions-extreme-body-mass-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107953,"mean":7.8127680080038,"rank":71534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107953,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":358,"mean":2.488593837535,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":358,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.3571428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
