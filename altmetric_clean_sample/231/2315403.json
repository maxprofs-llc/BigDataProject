This report characterizes the prevalence, complexity, and clinical management of these lesions in a statewide pediatric cohort and examines predictors for receiving closures. A 15-year Medicaid data set (1996-2010) from one state was analyzed. The selection criteria specified patients 17 years of age or younger with a diagnosis of ASD primum, secundum, or sinus venosus on one or more service visits to a pediatrician or pediatric cardiologist. During the 15-year period, ASDs represented a prevalence rate for treatment of 0.47\/1000 CHDs identified, with 61 % presenting as complex lesions. Concomitant cardiac anomalies that might have a negative impact on prognosis were present including patent ductus arteriosus (26.1 %), pulmonary hypertension (3.8 %), and supraventricular tachycardia (2.4 %). Pharmacologic treatments, predominantly diuretics, were prescribed for 21 % of the cohort. Both surgical closures (6.3 %) and transcatheter closures (1.4 %) were used for ASD secundum cases, whereas surgical closures predominated for ASD primum (25.6 %) and sinus venosus (13.5 %) lesions. The postoperative follow-up period was two to three times longer for children with ASD primum or sinus venosus than for those with ASD secundum (average, ~1 year). Factors predicting the likelihood of having ASD closure were older age, having a concomitant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) repair, treatment with ibuprofen, having two or more concomitant CHDs, and receiving diuretics or preload\/afterload-reducing agents. Care of ASDs in routine practice settings involves more complications and appears to be more conservative than portrayed in previous investigations of isolated ASDs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032aa","authors":["Shuler CO","Tripathi A","Black GB","Park YM","Jerrell JM"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00246-013-0705-5","first_seen_on":"2014-04-30T11:06:14+00:00","issns":["0172-0643"],"issue":"","journal":"Pediatric Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1398855785,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23619832?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23619832","pubdate":"2013-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiac Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vascular Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","cardiology"],"title":"Prevalence of Treatment, Risk Factors, and Management of Atrial Septal Defects in a Pediatric Medicaid Cohort.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-treatment-risk-factors-management-atrial-septal-defects-pediatric-medicaid-cohort-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3568312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107869,"mean":7.7748673378577,"rank":84213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107869,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":0.87244206773619,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":0.72575757575758,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
