The obtained compounds have been structurally characterized and the topological analysis of 1 discloses a topologically unique trinodal 3,5,6-connected 3D network which, upon further simplification, results in a uninodal 8-connected underlying net with the bcu (body centred cubic) topology driven by the [Cu3(\u03bc2-N3)2] cluster nodes and \u03bc3-4-ptz linkers. In contrast, the 2D metal-organic network in 2 has been classified as a uninodal 4-connected underlying net with the sql [Shubnikov tetragonal plane net] topology assembled from the Cu nodes and \u03bc2-4-ptz linkers. The catalytic investigations disclosed that 1 and 2 act as active catalyst precursors towards the microwave-assisted homogeneous oxidation of secondary alcohols (1-phenylethanol, cyclohexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, 2-octanol and 3-octanol) with tert-butylhydroperoxide, leading to the yields of the corresponding ketones up to 86% (TOF = 430 h(-1)) and 58% (TOF = 290 h(-1)) in the oxidation of 1-phenylethanol and cyclohexanol, respectively, after 1 h under low power (10 W) microwave irradiation, and in the absence of any added solvent or additive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Suman Mukhopadhyay","Rajendar Nasani","Manideepa Saha","Mobin M Shaikh","Lu\u00edsa Martins","Alexander M.
