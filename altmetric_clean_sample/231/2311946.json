The pathogen responsible in most cases is the Aspergillus in its forms Fumigatus, Flavus and Niger. The diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms, characterized by headache, cough, and facial algia, are generally similar to that of chronic bacterial rhinosinusitis. It can be divided into invasive and non-invasive forms based on the clinical evolution and extent of the lesion. We report a case of non-invasive fungal rhinosinusitis in a patient with recurrent sinusitis and pain in the left maxillary region, resistant to antibiotic therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91d3cf058f61000d406","authors":["E Fanucci","M Nezzo","L Neroni","L Montesani","L Ottria","M Gargari"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-29T10:17:30+00:00","issns":["1974-5648"],"issue":"3","journal":"Oral implantology","last_mentioned_on":1398766594,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24772263?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24772263","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"CIC Edizioni Internazionali s.r.l.","title":"Diagnosis and treatment of paranasal sinus fungus ball of odontogenic origin: case report.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-treatment-paranasal-sinus-fungus-ball-odontogenic-origin-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107940,"mean":7.7664118622557,"rank":73659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107940,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PubmedCoughbot\/status\/461086633274535936","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2311946],"posted_on":"2014-04-29T10:16:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Pubmed Coughbot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438048647117152256\/_r3nPGGz_normal.jpeg","description":"Trawling PubMed for updates on cough research, with a focus on urge to cough (picture cc arthurjohnpicton)","id_on_source":"PubmedCoughbot","tweeter_id":"2359976634","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"461086633274535936"}]}}
