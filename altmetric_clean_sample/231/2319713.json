Density-functional theory calculations show that the band gap of a free h-BN monolayer is 4.6 eV but a slight protrusion of the unoccupied BN states toward the Fermi level is observed if BN is supported on Au(111) due to the BN-Au interaction. A theoretically predicted metastable configuration of O2 on h-BN\/Au(111), which can serve as precursors for ORR, and free energy diagrams for ORR on h-BN\/Au(111) via two- and four-electron pathways show that ORR to H2O2 is possible at this electrode. It is experimentally proved that overpotential for ORR at the gold electrode is significantly reduced by depositing BN nanosheets. No such effect is observed at the glassy carbon electrode, demonstrating the importance of BN-substrate interaction for h-BN to act as the ORR electrocatalyst. A possible role of the edge of the BN islands for ORR is also discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Kohei Uosaki","Ganesan Elumalai","Hidenori Noguchi","Takuya Masuda","Andrey Lyalin","Akira Nakayama","Tetsuya Taketsugu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja500393g","first_seen_on":"2014-05-01T21:39:07+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1403522401,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja500393g","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja500393g"],"pmid":"24773085","pubdate":"2014-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140428110104005","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Boron Nitride Nanosheet on Gold as an Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Theoretical Suggestion and Experimental Proof.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/boron-nitride-nanosheet-gold-electrocatalyst-oxygen-reduction-reaction-theoretical-suggestion-experi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":408435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4094577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107924,"mean":7.8101025916628,"rank":13355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":94439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107924,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1006082574142,"rank":1445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":14002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":5.8838008849558,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
