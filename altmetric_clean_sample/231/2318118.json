Causes of xerostomia include medications, the effects of radiation therapy on the salivary glands during the treatment of head and neck cancer or thyroid cancer, and autoimmune diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. The primary treatment to reduce xerostomia is oral pilocarpine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c2","authors":["Berk L"],"doi":"10.1517\/17425255.4.10.1333","first_seen_on":"2014-05-01T08:05:23+00:00","issns":["1742-5255"],"issue":"10","journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1398920400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18798702"],"pmid":"18798702","pubdate":"2008-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Systemic pilocarpine for treatment of xerostomia.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systemic-pilocarpine-treatment-xerostomia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712057,"mean":4.9755845515295,"rank":621296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3074865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712057,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95096,"mean":7.162190798675,"rank":17877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":76934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95096,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":1.4070432569975,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1909090909091,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
