Its effect is apparent on physical and behavioral parameters and on average life span. Carnosine has a similar effect on mice of the control strain, but this is less pronounced due to the non-accelerated character of their senescence processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f6","authors":["A A Boldyrev","S C Gallant","G T Sukhich"],"first_seen_on":"2014-04-29T22:25:10+00:00","issns":["0144-8463"],"issue":"6","journal":"Bioscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1398380239,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10841274"],"pmid":"10841274","pubdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Carnosine, the protective, anti-aging peptide.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carnosine-protective-antiaging-peptide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3690052,"mean":4.9596403670334,"rank":400788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3281062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3690052,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94774,"mean":7.1137380477562,"rank":12469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":82115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94774,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":1.7825812807882,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.1875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":7,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"When you don't eat meat, what are the roles of carnitine or carnosine?","url":"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/article\/when-you-don-t-eat-meat-what-are-the-roles-of-carnitine-or-carnosine","license":"public","citation_ids":[2313683,1391307,2313684,1722876,2313685,762902,941589,1349569,2165104,1433634,1407153,1454690,2313686,2313687],"posted_on":"2014-04-24T22:57:19+00:00","summary":"Are you using the supplement carnosine to build up your muscles for running or weight lifting?
