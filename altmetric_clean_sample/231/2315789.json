Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data, strain SF87(T) is shown to be closely related (98% similarity) to Xenorhabdus hominickii DSM 17903(T). Nucleotide sequences of strain SF87 obtained from the recA, dnaN, gltX, gyrB and infB genes showed 96-97% similarity with Xenorhabdus miraniensis DSM 17902(T). However, strain SF87 shares only 52.7% DNA-DNA relatedness with the type strain of X. miraniensis, confirming that it belongs to a different species. Strains SF87(T), SF80, SF362 and 106-C are phenotypically similar to X. miraniensis and X. beddingii, except that they do not produce acid from aesculin. These strains are thus considered to represent a novel species of the genus Xenorhabdus, for which the name Xenorhabdus khoisanae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SF87(T) (\u200a=DSM 25463(T)\u200a=ATCC BAA-2406(T)).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Ferreira T","van Reenen CA","Endo A","Spr\u00f6er C","Malan AP","Dicks LM"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.049049-0","endpage":"3224","first_seen_on":"2014-04-30T13:07:55+00:00","issns":["1466-5026","1466-5034"],"issue":"Pt 9","journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1469524177,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23456807?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23456807"],"pmid":"23456807","pubdate":"2013-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"3220","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Description of Xenorhabdus khoisanae sp. nov., the symbiont of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema khoisanae.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/description-xenorhabdus-khoisanae-sp-nov-symbiont-entomopathogenic-nematode-steinernema-khoisanae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":1974778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6120233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178187,"mean":7.4527297430777,"rank":45288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":132017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178187,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3667,"mean":2.7913944353519,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3667,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":1.43,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
