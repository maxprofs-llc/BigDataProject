There are reasons to believe that knowledge of brain tissue oxygenation (BtipO2) would add information with the potential of improving patient outcome. The aim of this study was to examine BtipO2 and cerebral metabolism using the Neurovent-PTO probe and cerebral microdialysis (MD) in TBI patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9c","authors":["Purins, Karlis","Lew\u00e9n, Anders","Hillered, Lars Tomas","Howells, Tim","Enblad, Per","Hillered, Lars"],"doi":"10.3389\/fneur.2014.00064","first_seen_on":"2014-05-01T09:46:03+00:00","issns":["","1664-2295"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1398937533,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fneur.2014.00064\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Article\/DownloadFile\/20192\/FLPDF\/fneur-05-00064.pdf\/163","pmcid":"PMC4013462","pmid":"24817863","pubdate":"2014-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Brain Tissue Oxygenation and Cerebral Metabolic Patterns in Focal and Diffuse Traumatic Brain Injury","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-tissue-oxygenation-cerebral-metabolic-patterns-focal-diffuse-traumatic-brain-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508612,"mean":5.1916753366762,"rank":3036503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":909041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508612,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107938,"mean":7.8521454366901,"rank":70770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107938,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":797,"mean":3.7046281407035,"rank":490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":797,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":4.7703888888889,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
