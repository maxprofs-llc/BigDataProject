On the other hand, severely suppressed bone turnover (SSBT) after long-term bisphosphonates (BPs) use has been considered to be one of the causes of low-energy diaphyseal femoral fractures, often called atypical femoral fractures (AFFs). Some studies have shown that BPs use for more than 5 years is associated with an increased risk of AFFs. Here, we present a report of our SBF case series experienced in the past 15 years in order to examine whether bowing deformity should be considered among the causes of AFFs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea2","authors":["Yoto Oh","Yoshiaki Wakabayashi","Yoshiro Kurosa","Masafumi Ishizuki","Atsushi Okawa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00776-014-0572-9","first_seen_on":"2014-05-01T01:04:12+00:00","issns":["1436-2023","0949-2658"],"journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Science","last_mentioned_on":1398906244,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00776-014-0572-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00776-014-0572-9.pdf","pmid":"24789301","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Stress fracture of the bowed femoral shaft is another cause of atypical femoral fracture in elderly Japanese: a case series","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stress-fracture-bowed-femoral-shaft-another-cause-atypical-femoral-fracture-elderly-japanese-case-se-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3712057,"mean":4.9755720339382,"rank":2970365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3712057,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95095,"mean":7.1624417313395,"rank":75676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95095,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":0.82005533596838,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.35178571428571,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/boooooooooone2\/status\/461672366666285056","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2317473],"posted_on":"2014-05-01T01:04:04+00:00","author":{"name":"\u9aa8\u592a\u90ce","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/506058431854157824\/J_HVXLUJ_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"boooooooooone2","tweeter_id":"934545362","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2},"tweet_id":"461672366666285056"}]}}
