Recently, cases of durable remission after Tpo-RA discontinuation in adult ITP have been reported. We aimed to describe the subset of patients in whom transient Tpo-RA therapy may induce a durable response. We studied all adults with primary ITP treated with at least one Tpo-RA over a 5-year period (n\u00a0=\u00a054) and seen at one of three participating referral centres in France. Tpo-RAs were discontinued in 20 of 28 patients who achieved a complete response. We excluded six patients because a previous treatment at the start of Tpo-RA treatment may have interfered with the response. Overall, eight patients with chronic ITP showed a sustained response [median follow-up: 13\u00b75\u00a0months (range 5-27\u00a0months)]. We could not identify a predictive factor of sustained response. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of ITP patients receiving Tpo-RAs can maintain a durable response after treatment discontinuation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["Mah\u00e9vas M","Fain O","Ebbo M","Roudot-Thoraval F","Limal N","Khellaf M","Schleinitz N","Bierling P","Languille L","Godeau B","Michel M"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjh.12888","first_seen_on":"2014-04-30T17:16:31+00:00","issns":["0007-1048"],"issue":"","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1398879016,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24725224"],"pmid":"24725224","pubdate":"2014-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"The temporary use of thrombopoietin-receptor agonists may induce a prolonged remission in adult chronic immune thrombocytopenia.
