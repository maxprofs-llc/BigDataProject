However, the molecular mechanism mediating this effect of GC remains unknown. Here we used complementary molecular and behavioral approaches in mice and rats and in genetically modified mice in which the GR was conditionally deleted (GR(NesCre)). We identified the tPA-BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway as the upstream molecular effectors of GR-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1\/2(MAPK) responsible for the enhancement of contextual fear memory. These findings complete our knowledge of the molecular cascade through which GC enhance contextual fear memory and highlight the role of tPA-BDNF-TrkB-Erk1\/2(MAPK) signaling pathways as one of the core effectors of stress-related effects of GC.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 15 October 2013; doi:10.1038\/mp.2013.134.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311c","doi":"10.1038\/mp.2013.134","first_seen_on":"2014-04-28T17:04:01+00:00","issns":["1359-4184","1476-5578"],"journal":"Molecular Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1411146921,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/mp.2013.134","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/mp.2013.134"],"pmid":"24126929","pubdate":"2013-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","psychiatry"],"title":"BDNF-TrkB signaling through Erk1|[sol]|2MAPK phosphorylation mediates the enhancement of fear memory induced by glucocorticoids","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bdnftrkb-signaling-through-erk12mapk-phosphorylation-mediates-enhancement-fear-memory-induced-glucoc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4274597,"mean":5.0385474031468,"rank":2132649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1924966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4274597,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105765,"mean":7.5486518475095,"rank":48343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":51272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105765,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1338,"mean":16.23647868362,"rank":947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1338,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":24.9582,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
