These neutral complexes were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods and by single crystal X-ray crystallography. Cyclic voltammetry in dichloroethane revealed chemically reversible ferrocenyl oxidation signals followed by characteristic \"stripping reduction peaks\" showing evidence for oxidation-product electro-crystallization. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed spontaneous formation of crystalline oxidation products with three distinct morphologies for X = Cl(-), Br(-), I(-). Energy dispersive X-ray elemental analysis data show Fe\u2009:\u2009P ratios of 1\u2009:\u20092.0, 1\u2009:\u20092.1 and 1\u2009:\u20092.1 for electro-crystallization products of complexes , , and , respectively, indicating the presence of two [PF6](-) anions in the vicinity of the dioxidized complexes, and suggesting product formulae [](2+)[PF6](-)2, [](2+)[PF6](-)2 and [](2+)[PF6](-)2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Paul R Raithby","Hakikulla H Shah","Rayya A Al-Balushi","Mohammed K Al-Suti","Muhammad S Khan","Frank Marken","Anna Sudlow","Gabriele Kociok-Kohn","Christopher H.
