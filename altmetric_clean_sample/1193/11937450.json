MMG measures of muscle contractile properties (contraction time; T c, maximum displacement; D max, contraction velocity; V c), electromyographic (EMG) measures of muscle fatigue (median power frequency; MPF), strength measures (maximum voluntary contraction; MVC) and measures of muscle thickness (ultrasound) were obtained.\nTwo-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between treatment and control limbs. During the hypertrophic phase treatment MVC initially declined (weeks 1-3), due to fatigue (decline in MPF), followed by improvement against control during weeks 6-8. Between weeks 5 and 8 treatment, muscle thickness was greater than control, reflecting gross hypertrophy. MMG variables Dmax (weeks 2, 7) and Vc (weeks 7, 8) declined. During the atrophic phase, MVC (weeks 9-12) and muscle thickness (weeks 9, 10) initially remained high before declining to control levels, reflecting gross atrophy. MMG variables D max (weeks 9, 14) and V c (weeks 9, 14, 15) also declined during the atrophic phase. No change in T c was found throughout the hypertrophic or atrophic phases.\nMMG detects changes in contractile properties during stages of exercise-induced hypertrophy and disuse atrophy suggesting its applicability as a clinical tool in musculoskeletal rehabilitation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733b","authors":["Christian Than","Danijel Tosovic","Laura Seidl","J.
