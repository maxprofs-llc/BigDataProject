However, the efficacy of PRP treatment for tendinopathy is controversial. This paper focuses on reviewing the basic science studies on PRP performed under well-controlled conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo studies describe PRP's anabolic and anti-inflammatory effects on tendons. While some clinical trials support these findings, others refute them. In this review, we discuss the effectiveness of PRP to treat tendon injuries with evidence presented in basic science studies and the potential reasons for the controversial results in clinical trials. Finally, we comment on the approaches that may be required to improve the efficacy of PRP treatment for tendinopathy.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Zhou, Yiqin","Wang, James H-C"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/9103792","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-09-10T10:54:44+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams"],"issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1483544949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27610386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2016\/9103792\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2016\/9103792.pdf","pmid":"27610386","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","startpage":"1","title":"PRP Treatment Efficacy for Tendinopathy: A Review of Basic Science Studies","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prp-treatment-efficacy-tendinopathy-review-basic-science-studies-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":5764058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1932615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248534,"mean":12.295205457625,"rank":162954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248534,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4258,"mean":2.9150730561428,"rank":2185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4258,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":10.461781818182,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
