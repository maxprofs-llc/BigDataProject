The exploration of scorpion venom has been reported due to the presence of recombinant peptides. rBm\u03b1TX14 is an \u03b1-neurotoxin extracted from the venom gland of the East Asian scorpion Buthus martensii Karsch and can affect ion channel conductance. Here, we investigated the functions of rBm\u03b1TX14 using the Caenorhabditis elegans model. Using western blot analysis, rBm\u03b1TX14 was shown to be expressed both in the cytoplasm and inclusion bodies in the E.coli Rosetta (DE3) strain. Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that purified rBm\u03b1TX14 retained its biological structures. Next, feeding nematodes with E.coli Rosetta (DE3) expressing rBm\u03b1TX14 caused extension of the life span and promoted the locomotion of the nematodes. In addition, we identified several genes that play various roles in the life span and locomotion of C. elegans through microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. Furthermore, if the amino acid site H15 of rBm\u03b1TX14 was mutated, rBm\u03b1TX14 no longer promoted the C. elegans life span. In conclusion, the results not only demonstrated the functions and mechanism of rBm\u03b1TX14 in C. elegans, but also provided the new sight in the utility of recombinant peptides from scorpion venom.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Chen, Lan","Zhang, Ju","Xu, Jie","Wan, Lu","Teng, Kaixuan","Xiang, Jin","Zhang, Rui","Huang, Zebo","Liu, Yongmei","Li, Wenhua","Liu, Xin","Lan Chen","Ju Zhang","Jie Xu","Lu Wan","Kaixuan Teng","Jin Xiang","Rui Zhang","Zebo Huang","Yongmei Liu","Wenhua Li","Xin Liu","Aamir Nazir"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0161847","first_seen_on":"2016-09-10T10:30:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1503747963,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611314?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161847","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611314?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0161847.PDF","pmid":"27611314","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0161847","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"rBm\u03b1TX14 Increases the Life Span and Promotes the Locomotion of Caenorhabditis Elegans","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rbm%CE%B1tx14-increases-life-span-promotes-locomotion-caenorhabditis-elegans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":3665742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4643607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253461,"mean":12.491659662274,"rank":104402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":144675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253461,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116193,"mean":10.656224955247,"rank":49268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":64094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116193,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4242,"mean":10.020019806649,"rank":1854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4242,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
