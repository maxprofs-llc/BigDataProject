Expression of Mogat1 is tissue restricted and it is highly expressed in the kidney, stomach and adipose tissue but minimally in the normal adult liver. To understand the transcriptional regulation of Mogat1, we characterized the mouse and human Mogat1 promoters in human kidney proximal tubule-2 (HK-2) cells. In-silico analysis revealed several peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) binding sites in the promoters of both human and mouse Mogat1. These sites responded to all three peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms such that their respective agonist or antagonist activated or inhibited the expression of Mogat1. PPRE site mutagenesis revealed that sites located at -592 and -2518 are very effective in decreasing luciferase reporter gene activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using PPAR\u03b1 antibody further confirmed the occupancy of these sites by PPAR\u03b1. While these assays revealed the core promoter elements necessary for Mogat1 expression, there are additional elements required to regulate its tissue specific expression. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay revealed additional cis-elements located ~10-15 kb upstream which interact with the core promoter. These chromosomal regions are responsive to both PPAR\u03b1 agonist and antagonist.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sankella, Shireesha","Garg, Abhimanyu","Agarwal, Anil K"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0162504","first_seen_on":"2016-09-10T10:29:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1473503345,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27611931?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27611931","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0162504","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Characterization of the Mouse and Human Monoacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase 1 (Mogat1) Promoter in Human Kidney Proximal Tubule and Rat Liver Cells","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-mouse-human-monoacylglycerol-oacyltransferase-1-mogat1-promoter-human-kidney-proxim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":7222584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252739,"mean":12.456792227524,"rank":210418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252739,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115457,"mean":10.618014932096,"rank":97305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115457,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4243,"mean":10.018962753418,"rank":3702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4243,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/774555287730610176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11933460],"posted_on":"2016-09-10T10:29:05+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
