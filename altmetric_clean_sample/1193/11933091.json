For the last six years, the consortium's aims have been to foster communication and collaboration between members, encourage dialogue in an open forum, and deliver clinical trial results that improve the care and outcomes of patients with cancer using the latest advances in genomic-based medicine. The annual WIN Symposium, held over two days, is a chance for its members to come together and discuss ongoing research, recent announcements, and introduce new developments in personalised medicine. This year's conference, held in Paris, France 27-29 June, consisted of six dedicated sessions, including two debates, and posters from members and participating organisations, all focusing on the latest therapeutic advances and updates in genomic analysis. Special highlights from this year included discussion of the MINDACT clinical trial, which uses a gene expression test to identify patients with breast cancer who can safely forego adjuvant chemotherapy, and the reflections on the SHIVA trial. Of particular interest to many speakers was the utilisation of liquid biopsy samples to produce near real time snapshots of tumour mutational profiles and vulnerability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003bc9","authors":["Schilsky, Richard","Davies, Will"],"doi":"10.3332\/ecancer.2016.669","first_seen_on":"2016-09-10T10:08:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1754-6605","17546605"],"journal":"Ecancermedicalscience","last_mentioned_on":1473631293,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27610195?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27610195","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Highlights from the 2016 WIN Symposium, 27\u201329 June 2016, Paris: personalised therapy beyond next-generation sequencing","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highlights-2016-win-symposium-2729-june-2016-paris-personalised-therapy-beyond-nextgeneration-sequen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":6045326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252792,"mean":12.456730279163,"rank":164143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252792,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205,"mean":9.5588725490196,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":16.185714285714,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
