Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is an efficient anesthetic used in surgery. Our study aimed to explore the role of Dex in the malignancy of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Further, we investigate the molecular mechanism involved in the function of Dex on breast cancer cells.\nThe methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was applied to detect cell proliferation. The migration and invasion capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was tested by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Western blot analysis was performed to quantify the protein expression levels of \u03b12-adrenoceptor and ERK.\nThe proliferation, migration and invasion ability of MDA-MB-231 cells was gradually increased after treatment of Dex in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In addition, Dex could significantly elevate the volume and weight of xenotransplant tumor in vivo. Furthermore, Dex up-regulated the protein level of a2-adrenoceptor and consistently enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK without changing the total level of it. Similarity, over-expression of a2-adrenoceptor via its agonist Clonidine could mimic the function of Dex on breast cancer.\nThese data suggest that Dex could promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells through the activation of \u03b12B-adrenoceptor \/ERK signaling.","authors":["Xia, M","Ji, N-N","Duan, M-L","Tong, J-H","Xu, J-G","Zhang, Y-M","Wang, S-H"],"first_seen_on":"2016-09-10T10:30:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2284-0729"],"issue":"16","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","last_mentioned_on":1473503382,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27608913?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27608913","pubdate":"2016-09-10T22:06:40+00:00","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Dexmedetomidine regulate the malignancy of breast cancer cells by activating \u03b12-adrenoceptor\/ERK signaling pathway.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dexmedetomidine-regulate-malignancy-breast-cancer-cells-activating-%CE%B12adrenoceptorerk-signaling-pathw"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
