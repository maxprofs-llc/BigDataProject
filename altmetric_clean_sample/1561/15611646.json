They received a postal questionnaire at the age of 16years and a follow-up questionnaire two years later. The first inquiry contained questions about the sites of musculoskeletal pain; the second had the same pain questions, along with measures of distress and anxiety. Risk ratios (RR) were assessed by log-linear regression analysis.\nMulti-site musculoskeletal pain (in \u22652 body locations) at both 16 and 18years was common, reported by 53% of girls and 30% of boys. Multi-site pain at both ages, compared to those with multi-site pain neither at 16 nor 18years, was associated with psychological distress at the age of 18 among both girls (RR 1.8 95% CI 1.2-2.7) and boys (RR 3.5 95% CI 2.1-5.9). For anxiety, the corresponding relative risks were 1.5 (95% CI 1.0-2.2) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.3), respectively. For short-term multi-site pain (prevalent only at the age of 16 or 18), these relative risks were between 0.8 and 2.3.\nAdolescents with long-term multi-site pain have higher levels of distress and anxiety than those without or with only short-term multi-site pain. Associations were found in both genders, but the relationship between pain and distress was more pronounced among boys. The associations had modest effect strength.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eec","authors":["Juha Auvinen","Pasi J Eskola","Hanni-Rosa Ohtonen","Markus Paananen","Jari Jokelainen","Markku Timonen","Jussi Vahtera","P\u00e4ivi Leino-Arjas","Jaro Karppinen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpsychores.2016.12.006","endpage":"32","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T16:09:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00223999","1879-1360"],"journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","last_mentioned_on":1485469183,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S002239991630575X"],"pmid":"28107889","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"28","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Long-term adolescent multi-site musculoskeletal pain is associated with psychological distress and anxiety","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S002239991630575X","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-adolescent-multisite-musculoskeletal-pain-associated-psychological-distress-anxiety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.2,"score_history":{"1y":11.2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":729072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7352845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261179,"mean":12.793950891729,"rank":37709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":223379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261179,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1349,"mean":6.3074747774481,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1349,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":6.43308,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":4,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
