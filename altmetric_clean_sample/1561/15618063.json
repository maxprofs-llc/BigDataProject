In the last decade, however, this vision has been challenged by evidence-based medicine showing the almost complete failure of clinical trials that experimented anti-amyloid therapies with great hopes. Moreover, data have accumulated which clearly indicates that this small peptide plays a key role in the physiological processes of memory formation. In the present review, we will discuss the different aspects of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, highlighting its pros and cons, and we will analyse the results of the therapeutic approaches attempted to date that should change the direction of Alzheimer's disease research in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269d","authors":["Ricciarelli, Roberta","Fedele, Ernesto"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T23:15:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-6190"],"journal":"Current Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1484954025,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28093977"],"pmid":"28093977","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"title":"The amyloid cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease: it's time to change our mind.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amyloid-cascade-hypothesis-alzheimers-disease-time-change-mind"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":1154907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6860187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259452,"mean":12.81661501401,"rank":56242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":199768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259452,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":4.7990060606061,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.3375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
