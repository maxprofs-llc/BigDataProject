Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) has been shown to result from a selective loss of hypothalamic hypocretin-secreting neurons with patients typically showing low CSF-hypocretin levels (<110 pg\/ml). This specific loss of hypocretin and the strong association with the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele led to the hypothesis that NT1 could be an immune-mediated pathology. Moreover, susceptibility to NT1 has recently been associated with several pathogens, particularly with influenza A H1N1 virus either through infection or vaccination. The goal of this study was to compare peripheral blood immune cell populations in recent onset pediatric NT1 subjects (post or non-post 2009-influenza A H1N1 vaccination) to healthy donors. We demonstrated an increased number of central memory CD4+ T cells (CD62L+ CD45RA-) associated to an activated phenotype (increase in CD69 and CD25 expression) in NT1 patients. Percentage and absolute count of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in NT1 patients were increased associated with an activated phenotype (increase in GITR and LAP expression), and of activated memory phenotype. Cytokine production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after activation was not modified in NT1 patients. In H1N1 vaccinated NT1 patients, absolute counts of CD3+, CD8+ T cells, and B cells were increased compared to non-vaccinated NT1 patients. These results support a global T cell activation in NT1 patients and thus support a T cell-mediated autoimmune origin of NT1, but do not demonstrate the pathological role of H1N1 prophylactic vaccination. They should prompt further studies of T cells, particularly of Tregs (such as suppression and proliferation antigen specific assays, and also T-cell receptor sequencing), in NT1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Michel Lecendreux","Guillaume Churlaud","Fabien Pitoiset","Armelle Regnault","Tu Anh Tran","Roland Liblau","David Klatzmann","Michelle Rosenzwajg","Frederic Rieux-Laucat"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0169836","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T19:32:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1502449930,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0169836&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28107375","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0169836","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28107375?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0169836&type=printable","pmid":"28107375","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0169836","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Narcolepsy Type 1 Is Associated with a Systemic Increase and Activation of Regulatory T Cells and with a Systemic Activation of Global T Cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0169836","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/narcolepsy-type-1-associated-systemic-increase-activation-regulatory-t-cells-systemic-activation-glo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":6.05,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":1380719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6970104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277055,"mean":12.526902069632,"rank":66876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":209898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277055,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115457,"mean":10.618014932096,"rank":25993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":89399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115457,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4736,"mean":11.36859345301,"rank":1125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4736,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
