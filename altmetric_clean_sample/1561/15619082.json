In addition, by utilizing the thiol-ene photopolymerization with tunable crosslink density, we demonstrate the importance of monomer conversion on the retention of omniphilic cargo in double emulsion templated microcapsules. Furthermore, we highlight the rapid cure kinetics afforded by thiol-ene chemistry in a continuous flow photopatterning device for hemispherical microparticle production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Douglas V.
