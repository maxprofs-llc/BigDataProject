Lifetime risk was calculated using the life table method, taking competing causes of death into account and using well recognised methods such as the cumulative rate and risk.\nRegional cancer registry of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre IKL, located in Maastricht, The Netherlands.\nPatients with a first primary malignancy in 1989-90 in the catchment area of the cancer registry.\nThe lifetime risk of developing cancer was estimated to be 34.8% for males and 30.4% for females. In males, especially, the risk estimates were considerably higher when the cumulative risk was used.\nThe life table method is convenient for estimating the probability that a person will develop cancer during a defined period or during his or her lifetime. The other estimates overestimate the risk of the disease under investigation, especially in the very elderly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["L J Schouten","H Straatman","L A Kiemeney","A L Verbeek"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech.48.6.596","endpage":"600","first_seen_on":"2017-01-12T19:38:07+00:00","issns":["0143-005X","1470-2738"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1424460404,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/jech.48.6.596"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/48\/6\/596.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1060039","pmid":"7830016","pubdate":"1994-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"596","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Cancer incidence: life table risk versus cumulative risk.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-incidence-life-table-risk-versus-cumulative-risk-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6953394,"mean":6.2315395168925,"rank":1624564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4536498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6953394,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98799,"mean":11.065707301767,"rank":29871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":67534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98799,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1995,"mean":14.770798395186,"rank":929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1995,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":17.178375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
