Life in the marine world depends heavily on marine fungi scavenging the oceans of lifeless plants and animals and entering them into the nutrient cycle by. Approximately 150 to 200 new compounds, including alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polyketides, and aromatic compounds, are identified from marine fungi annually. In recent years, numerous investigations demonstrated the tremendous potential of marine fungi as a promising source to develop new antivirals against different important viruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the human immunodeficiency virus, and the influenza virus. Various genera of marine fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Fusarium were subjected to compound isolation and antiviral studies, which led to an illustration of the strong antiviral activity of a variety of marine fungi-derived compounds. The present review strives to summarize all available knowledge on active compounds isolated from marine fungi with antiviral activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Soheil Zorofchian Moghadamtousi","Sonia Nikzad","Habsah Abdul Kadir","Sazaly Abubakar","Keivan Zandi"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13074520","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T06:00:49+00:00","issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"7","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1499925245,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4515631\/"],"pmid":"26204947","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"4520","subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Potential Antiviral Agents from Marine Fungi: An Overview","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-antiviral-agents-marine-fungi-overview"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":6229755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1104631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179355,"mean":11.445185220291,"rank":126817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179355,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1051,"mean":3.5296723809524,"rank":741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1051,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.1721666666667,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
