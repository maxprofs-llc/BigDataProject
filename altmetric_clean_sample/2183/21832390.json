The present study aimed to examine the effect of lipid-supplemented concentrates on milk fat content, fatty acid composition, FFA, lipoprotein lipase activity, sensory properties, and size of milk fat globules of goat milk. Thirty goats assigned to 3 experimental groups were fed different concentrates from 60 d in milk (DIM) until late lactation (230 DIM). The diets were (1) control concentrate (no added fat); (2) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) hydrogenated palm oil enriched with palmitic acid (POFA); and (3) control concentrate with 8% (added on air-dry basis) rapeseed oil (RSO). The POFA group produced milk with the highest fat content, and fat content was positively correlated with the mean size of milk fat globules. Goats in the RSO group had a higher content of long-chain and unsaturated fatty acids, whereas milk from goats in the POFA group had a higher content of palmitic and palmitoleic acids (C16:0 and C16:1 cis). The control group produced milk with a higher content of short-, medium-, odd-, and branched-chain fatty acids compared with the 2 other groups. The content of FFA in milk was low in early and late lactation and peaked in mid lactation (90 DIM). A high content of FFA was correlated with poor sensory properties (tart\/rancid flavor). The RSO group produced milk with lower content of FFA and off-flavors in mid lactation and a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, replacement of palm oil with rapeseed oil as a lipid source in dairy goat feed would be favorable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Inglingstad, R.A.","Skeie, S.","Vegarud, G.E.","Devold, T.G.","Chilliard, Y.","Ekn\u00e6s, M.","R.A.
