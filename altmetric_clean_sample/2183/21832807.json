Deregulation of CDK2 activity is associated with diseases such as cancer. The analysis of substrates identified S\/T-P-X-R\/K\/H as the CDK2 consensus sequence. The crystal structure of cyclin A\/CDK2 with a short model peptide supports this sequence and identifies key interactions. However, CDKs use additional determinants to recognize substrates, including the RXL motif that is read by the cyclin subunits. We were interested to determine whether additional amino acids beyond the minimal consensus sequence of the well-studied substrate and tumor suppressor p27(KIP1) were relevant for catalysis.\nTo address whether additional amino acids, close to the minimal consensus sequence, play a role in binding, we investigate the interaction of cyclin A\/CDK2 with an in vivo cellular partner and CDK inhibitor p27(KIP1). This protein is an intrinsically unfolded protein and, in particular, the C-terminal half of the protein has not been accessible to structural analysis. This part harbors the CDK2 phosphorylation site. We used bioinformatics tools, including MODELLER, iTASSER and HADDOCK, along with partial structural information to build a model of the C-terminal region of p27(KIP1) with cyclin A\/CDK2. This revealed novel interactions beyond the consensus sequence with a proline and a basic amino acid at the P\u2009+\u20091 and the P\u2009+\u20093 sites, respectively. We suggest that the lysine at P\u2009+\u20092 might regulate the reversible association of the second counter ion in the active site of CDK2. The arginine at P\u2009+\u20097 interacts with both cyclin A and CDK2 and is important for the catalytic turnover rate.\nOur modeling identifies additional amino acids in p27(KIP1) beyond the consensus sequence that contribute to the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Jinyu Li","J\u00f6rg Vervoorts","Paolo Carloni","Giulia Rossetti","Bernhard L\u00fcscher"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12859-016-1411-0","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T03:20:41+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1504792445,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12859-016-1411-0","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28056778?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12859-016-1411-0?site=bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28056778","pubdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"15","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Structural prediction of the interaction of the tumor suppressor p27KIP1 with cyclin A\/CDK2 identifies a novel catalytically relevant determinant","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-prediction-interaction-tumor-suppressor-p27kip1-cyclin-acdk2-identifies-novel-catalytical"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":7244523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227081,"mean":12.849961555399,"rank":186752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227081,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3648,"mean":5.0120488072388,"rank":3383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3648,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":5.5617473684211,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
