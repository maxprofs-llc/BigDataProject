Among various kinds of sequencing data sets, epigenetic platform has just been important key to clarify the questions on broad and detail phenomenon in various forms of life. In this report, it is introduced that the research on identification of novel transcription factors in osteoclastogenesis using DNase-seq. Big data on musculoskeletal research will be organized by IFMRS and is getting more crucial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd21","authors":["Imai, Yuuki"],"doi":"clica1604573578","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T11:34:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0917-5857"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinical calcium","last_mentioned_on":1459001973,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27013628?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27013628?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27013628","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"[Application of big data analyses for musculoskeletal cell differentiation].","type":"article","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":6445675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011881351946,"rank":233962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":0.99556451612903,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.67307692307692,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/713732124868653056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6339632],"posted_on":"2016-03-26T14:19:33+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
