Using matched administrative and self-reported data for 474 youth who completed a baseline interview in the Midwest Evaluation of Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth (i.e. the Midwest study) at ages 17-18, and 386 youth who completed a follow up interview at age 19, this study finds that official reports and self-reports of maltreatment prior to and during out-of-home care differ significantly. Findings from this study add insight into measurement discrepancies, and help to inform understanding of the extent of maltreatment experienced by this sub-sample of young people exiting out-of-home care in adulthood. Study findings have implications for independent living policy and practice in child welfare.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002502","authors":["Havlicek, Judy","Courtney, Mark E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chiabu.2015.12.006","endpage":"122","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T17:10:36+00:00","issns":["1873-7757","01452134"],"journal":"Child Abuse & Neglect","last_mentioned_on":1458922503,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0145213415004603"],"pmid":"26724824","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"110","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Maltreatment histories of aging out foster youth: A comparison of official investigated reports and self-reports of maltreatment prior to and during out-of-home care","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maltreatment-histories-aging-foster-youth-comparison-official-investigated-reports-selfreports-maltr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":1012043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6361047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275777,"mean":11.017280742341,"rank":55242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":217022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275777,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1466,"mean":5.5383235494881,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1466,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":5.0166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
