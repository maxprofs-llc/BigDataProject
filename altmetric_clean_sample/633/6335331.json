However, polyamorphism in glasses under high pressure remains poorly understood because of experimental challenges. Here we report new experimental findings of ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism in GeO2 glass, investigated using a newly developed double-stage large-volume cell. The Ge-O coordination number (CN) is found to remain constant at \u223c6 between 22.6 and 37.9 GPa. At higher pressures, CN begins to increase rapidly and reaches 7.4 at 91.7 GPa. This transformation begins when the oxygen-packing fraction in GeO2 glass is close to the maximal dense-packing state (the Kepler conjecture = \u223c0.74), which provides new insights into structural changes in network-forming glasses and liquids with CN higher than 6 at ultrahigh-pressure conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Yoshio Kono","Curtis Kenney-Benson","Daijo Ikuta","Yuki Shibazaki","Yanbin Wang","Guoyin Shen"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1524304113","first_seen_on":"2016-03-26T04:50:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1458967790,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/10\/1524304113.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/10\/1524304113.full.pdf","pmid":"26976585","pubdate":"2016-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201524304","subjects":["science"],"title":"\n              Ultrahigh-pressure polyamorphism in GeO\n              2\n              glass with coordination number >6\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrahighpressure-polyamorphism-geo-sub2sub-glass-coordination-number-gt6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":5631353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276432,"mean":11.011788381187,"rank":194339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276432,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44000,"mean":22.331485079206,"rank":40309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44000,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1106,"mean":56.415152941176,"rank":1023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1106,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":3,"Psychology":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UBCFoMGrantDev\/statuses\/713588749905473537","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6335331],"posted_on":"2016-03-26T04:49:50+00:00","author":{"name":"GrantDev","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/701826560781750272\/Kz1MpFOR_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"UBCFoMGrantDev","tweeter_id":"701825361764462593","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"713588749905473537"}]}}
