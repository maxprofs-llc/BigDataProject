A benzo-furan ring system in (I) and a methyl-thio-phene ring in (II) are fused with the respective carbazole moieties on the same sides. The mean plane of the carbazole ring system makes a dihedral angle of 3.17\u2005(7)\u00b0 with the benzo-furan ring system in (I) and a dihedral angle of 3.39\u2005(11)\u00b0 with the methyl-thio-phene ring in (II), implying that both fused units are essentially planar. The mean planes of the carbazole ring systems in both the compounds are almost orthogonal to the respective nitro-substituted phenyl rings, making dihedral angles of 75.64\u2005(10) and 77.63\u2005(12)\u00b0 in compounds (I) and (II), respectively. In (I), the phenyl-sulfonyl ring system is positionally disordered with a refined occupancy ratio of 0.63\u2005(2):0.37\u2005(2). In both compounds, the mol-ecular structures are stabilized by intra-molecular C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, generating S(6) ring motifs with the sulfone group O atoms. In the crystal of compound (I), mol-ecules are linked by pairs of C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, which generate R2(2)(18) inversion dimers, and inter-connected by C(14) chains running along the c-axis direction, whereas in compound (II), the C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds generate R4(3)(37) ring motifs. In the crystals of both compounds, C-H\u22efO hydrogen-bonded sheets are formed lying parallel to (10-1). In addition, C-H\u22ef\u03c0 and offset \u03c0-\u03c0 inter-actions [inter-centroid distance = 3.7158\u2005(14)\u2005\u00c5 in (I) and 3.9040\u2005(15)\u2005\u00c5 in (II)] are also present in the crystals of both compounds.","authors":["Swaminathan, K.","Narayanan, P.","Sethusankar, K.","Saravanan, V.","Mohanakrishnan, A.K.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989016016996","first_seen_on":"2016-11-05T11:57:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 12","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1506064468,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989016016996","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?su5333"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2016\/12\/00\/su5333\/su5333.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5137598","pmid":"27980820","pubdate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structures of two new carbazole derivatives: 12-(4-nitro\u00adphen\u00adyl)-7-phenyl\u00adsulfonyl-7H-benzofuro[2,3-b]carbazole and 2-methyl-4-(4-nitro\u00adphen\u00adyl)-9-phenyl\u00adsulfonyl-9H-thieno[2,3-b]carbazole","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structures-two-new-carbazole-derivatives-124nitrophenyl7phenylsulfonyl7hbenzofuro23bcarbazol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/794705827911389184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13358315],"posted_on":"2016-11-05T01:00:08+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"794705827911389184"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AfSynchrotron\/statuses\/911126533707849728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13358315],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T07:14:28+00:00","author":{"name":"African Synchrotron","url":"http:\/\/www.africanlightsource.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/664781160590016512\/HdA6bIC9_normal.jpg","description":"Scientists involved in synchtrotron-related research and the long-range planning for an African synchrotron lightsource","id_on_source":"AfSynchrotron","tweeter_id":"4127580483","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":865},"tweet_id":"911126533707849728"}]}}
