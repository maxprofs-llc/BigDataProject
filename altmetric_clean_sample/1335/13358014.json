We reviewed the literature for associations between football activities (including heading\/head injuries) and decline in brain structure\/function.\nSystematic literature review.\nMEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane-CRCT, SportDiscus, Cochrane-DSR=4 (accessed 2 August 2016).\nOriginal studies reporting on football-related persistent effects on brain structure\/function. Results from neurocognitive testing, neuroimaging and EEG were compared with controls and\/or correlated with heading frequency and\/or head injuries. Methodological quality was rated for risk-of-bias, including appropriateness of controls, correction for multiple statistical testing and assessment of heading frequency and head injuries.\n30 studies with 1691 players were included. Those 57% (8\/14) of case-control studies reporting persistent neurocognitive impairment had higher odds for inappropriate control of type 1 errors (OR=17.35 (95% CI (10.61 to 28.36)) and for inappropriate selection of controls (OR=1.72 (1.22 to 2.43)) than studies observing no impairment. Studies reporting a correlation between heading frequency and neurocognitive deficits (6\/17) had lower quality of heading assessment (OR=14.20 (9.01 to 22.39)) than studies reporting no such correlation. In 7 of 13 studies (54%), the number of head injuries correlated with the degree of neurocognitive impairment. Abnormalities on neuroimaging (6\/8 studies) were associated with subclinical neurocognitive deficits in 3 of 4 studies.\nVarious methodological shortcomings limit the evidence for persistent effects of football play on brain structure\/function. Sources of bias include low-quality assessment of heading frequency, inappropriate control for type 1 errors and inappropriate selection of controls. Combining neuroimaging techniques with neurocognitive testing in prospective studies seems most promising to further clarify on the impact of football on the brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["A A Tarnutzer","D Straumann","P Brugger","N Feddermann-Demont","Tarnutzer, A A","Straumann, D","Brugger, P","Feddermann-Demont, N"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjsports-2016-096593","first_seen_on":"2016-11-05T11:48:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14730480","1473-0480","0306-3674"],"journal":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1491823681,"links":["http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/bjsports-2016-096593v1?rss=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27815240\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27815240","http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/04\/bjsports-2016-096593.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjsm.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/04\/bjsports-2016-096593.full.pdf","pmid":"27815240","pubdate":"2016-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"bjsports-2016-096593","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Persistent effects of playing football and associated (subconcussive) head trauma on brain structure and function: a systematic review of the literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistent-effects-playing-football-associated-subconcussive-head-trauma-brain-structure-function-sy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":11.5,"6m":4.7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":696571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7335499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239013,"mean":13.061960554282,"rank":34559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":204250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239013,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4005,"mean":34.137052447552,"rank":1541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4005,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":86.626751592357,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3,"practitioner":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
