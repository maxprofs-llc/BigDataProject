Pontine noradrenaline has been shown to increase upon trauma and associated \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation appears to consolidate memory formation of traumatic events. Blocking adrenergic activity reduces physiological stress responses during recall of traumatic memories and impairs memory, implying a potential therapeutic role of \u03b2-blockers. This study examines the effect of pre-admission \u03b2-blockade on post-traumatic depression.\nAll adult trauma patients (\u226518 years) with severe, isolated traumatic brain injury (intracranial Abbreviated Injury Scale score (AIS) \u22653 and extracranial AIS\u2009<3) were recruited from the trauma registry of an urban university hospital between 2007 and 2011. Exclusion criteria were in-hospital deaths and prescription of antidepressants up to one year prior to admission. Pre- and post-admission \u03b2-blocker and antidepressant therapy data was requested from the national drugs registry. Post-traumatic depression was defined as the prescription of antidepressants within one year of trauma. Patients with and without pre-admission \u03b2-blockers were matched 1:1 by age, gender, Glasgow Coma Scale, Injury Severity Score and head AIS. Analysis was carried out using McNemar's and Student's t-test for categorical and continuous data, respectively.\nA total of 545 patients met the study criteria. Of these, 15% (n=80) were prescribed \u03b2-blockers. After propensity matching, 80 matched pairs were analyzed. 33% (n=26) of non \u03b2-blocked patients developed post-traumatic depression, compared to only 18% (n=14) in the \u03b2-blocked group (p=0.04). There were no significant differences in ICU (mean days: 5.8 (SD 10.5) vs. 5.6 (SD 7.2), p=0.85) or hospital length of stay (mean days: 21 (SD 21) vs. 21 (SD 20), p=0.94) between cohorts.\n\u03b2-blockade appears to act prophylactically and significantly reduces the risk of post-traumatic depression in patients suffering from isolated severe traumatic brain injuries. Further prospective randomized studies are warranted to validate this finding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ade","authors":["Ahl, Rebecka","Sjolin, Gabriel","Mohseni, Shahin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.injury.2016.10.041","first_seen_on":"2016-11-05T11:14:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00201383","1879-0267"],"journal":"Injury","last_mentioned_on":1478294899,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0020138316307185?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&ccp=y"],"pmid":"27817882","pubdate":"2016-11-08T22:05:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Does early beta-blockade in isolated severe traumatic brain injury reduce the risk of post traumatic depression?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-betablockade-isolated-severe-traumatic-brain-injury-reduce-risk-post-traumatic-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7644999,"mean":6.5733031223765,"rank":5783280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1028724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7644999,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233580,"mean":12.879547741877,"rank":161046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233580,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1240,"mean":4.7669539951574,"rank":933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1240,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":14.727826086957,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
