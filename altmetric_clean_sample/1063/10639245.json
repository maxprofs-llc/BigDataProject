One of the most interesting and examined features of these materials is the change of magnetic properties by changing the temperature or by irradiation with light at low temperatures. However, most prospective applications of such complexes require functioning at room temperature. This Concept article provides an overview about how the switching of spin-crossover metal complexes can be achieved at constant room temperature. The principles of switching by different physical and chemical methods in solution and in the solid state are presented in an easy-to-read form for nonspecialists. These are further supported and clarified by examples from the literature. The overview might also be interesting for experts that target spin-crossover systems functioning at ambient conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Khusniyarov, Marat M","Khusniyarov, Marat M."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201601140","endpage":"15191","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T17:53:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"43","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1476107208,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27529311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201601140\/abstract;jsessionid=45491945AA39B42FB5015077FE3C39AC.f01t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201601140\/pdf","pmid":"27529311","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"15178","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"How to Switch Spin-Crossover Metal Complexes at Constant Room Temperature","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/switch-spincrossover-metal-complexes-constant-room-temperature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":3665369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3665400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245145,"mean":11.995399854779,"rank":124243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":111169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245145,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5276,"mean":3.1060310900474,"rank":1969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5276,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":388,"mean":3.5207286821705,"rank":131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":388,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
