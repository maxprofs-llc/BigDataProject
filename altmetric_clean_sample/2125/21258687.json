Despite a growing effort to describe the extent and nature of the mosquito virome, little is known about how these viruses persist, spread, and interact with both their hosts and other microbes. To address this issue we performed a meta-transcriptomics analysis of 12 Western Australian mosquito populations structured by species and geographic location. Our results identified the complete genomes of 24 species of RNA viruses from a diverse range of viral families and orders, among which 19 are newly described. Comparisons of viromes revealed a striking difference between the two mosquito genera, with viromes of mosquitoes from the Aedes genus exhibiting substantially less diversity and lower abundance than those of Culex genus, within which viral abundance reached 16.87% of the total non-rRNA. In addition, there was little overlap in viral diversity between the two genera, although the viromes were very similar among the three Culex species studied, suggesting that host taxon plays a major role in structuring virus diversity. In contrast, we found no evidence that geographic location played a major role in shaping RNA virus diversity, and several viruses discovered here exhibited high similarity (95-98% nucleotide identity) to those from Indonesia and China. Finally, using abundance level and phylogenetic relationships we were able to distinguish potential mosquito viruses from those present in co-infecting bacteria, fungi, and protists. In sum, our meta-transcriptomics approach provides important insights into the ecology of mosquito RNA viruses.IMPORTANCE Studies of virus ecology have generally focused on individual viral species. However, recent advances in bulk RNA sequencing make it possible to utilize meta-transcriptomic approaches to reveal both complete virus diversity and their relative abundance. We used such a meta-transcriptomic approach to determine key aspects of the ecology of mosquito viruses in Western Australia. Our results show that RNA viruses are one of the most important components of the mosquito transcriptome, and we identified 19 new virus species from a diverse set of virus families. A key result was that host genetic background plays a more important role in shaping virus diversity than sampling location, with Culex species harbouring more viruses at greater abundance than those from Aedes mosquitoes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Mang Shi","Peter Neville","Jay Nicholson","John-Sebastian Eden","Allison Imrie","Edward C.
