A baseline IOP was measured in all cats in ventral recumbency with normal head position (horizontal to the ground) with no pressure on the neck or eyelids. To measure the IOP in dorsal recumbency, each cat was held in the dorsal recumbency position for 5 min. Four different manipulations were used, including maximal dorsoventral extension of the eyelids, lateral eyelid extension, manual compression of the ipsilateral jugular vein, and manual compression of both jugular veins. IOP after all the manipulations was measured in ventral recumbency.\nOverall the mean \u00b1 SD IOP values of all eyes in ventral recumbency, dorsal recumbency, maximal dorsoventral extension of the eyelids, lateral eyelid extension, compression of the right jugular vein, compression of the left jugular vein, and compression of the both jugular veins were 16.1 \u00b1 2.9 mmHg, 17.1 \u00b1 5.0 mmHg, 21.7 \u00b1 5.8 mmHg, 22.4 \u00b1 5.6 mmHg, 15.0 \u00b1 3.7 mmHg, 14.9 \u00b1 3.7 mmHg, and 16.1 \u00b1 4.6 mmHg, respectively. IOP was increased significantly in maximal dorsoventral extension of the eyelids (P = 0.001) and lateral eyelid extension (P = 0.001) compared to baseline.\nResults of this study may be beneficial for clinicians to be aware of the effects of body position, traction, and compression of the eyelids and neck on IOP during ophthalmic examination in cats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fc","authors":["Rajaei, Seyed Mehdi","Asadi, Faezeh","Rajabian, Mohammad Reza","Ostadhassan, Hesam","Crasta, Manuela"],"doi":"10.1111\/vop.12487","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T07:55:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1463-5216","1463-5224"],"journal":"Veterinary Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1498131565,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12487\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12487\/pdf","pmid":"28635137","pubdate":"2017-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Effect of body position, eyelid manipulation, and manual jugular compression on intraocular pressure in clinically normal cats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-body-position-eyelid-manipulation-manual-jugular-compression-intraocular-pressure-clinically"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":3960393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4415061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236990,"mean":12.951536138808,"rank":109231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":125979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236990,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":435,"mean":1.490133640553,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":435,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.2818181818182,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/877797190403575808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21259521],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T07:55:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2112},"tweet_id":"877797190403575808"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/catvetsusan\/statuses\/877845858808549378","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[21259521],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T11:08:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Susan Little, DVM","url":"http:\/\/drsusanlittle.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/820705994644852736\/9_UkTbzd_normal.jpg","description":"Vet specializing in feline medicine; editor & co-author of The Cat: Clinical Medicine & Management and August's Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine","id_on_source":"catvetsusan","tweeter_id":"18414262","geo":{"lt":45.41117,"ln":-75.69812,"country":"CA"},"followers":10254},"tweet_id":"877845858808549378"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChepisMelgar\/statuses\/877853527774593024","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[21259521],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T11:39:25+00:00","author":{"name":"chepis melgar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/740715520505184258\/oFSHWoCD_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ChepisMelgar","tweeter_id":"2648971676","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"877853527774593024"}]}}
