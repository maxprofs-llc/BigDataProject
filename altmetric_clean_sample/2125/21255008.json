An 18-year-old man underwent to gastroesophageal scintigraphy to assess the rate of gastric emptying. Increased activity was noted in the left lower lung field during the image acquisition. Careful analysis of the images showed that this activity was caused by hiatal herniation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Zhao, Xiaofei","Zhuang, Hongming"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000001739","first_seen_on":"2017-06-22T01:18:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0363-9762","1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1498094285,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28632697?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28632697","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Increased Activity in the Lung Field on Gastroesophageal Scintigraphy Is Not Always Due to Aspiration","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-activity-lung-field-gastroesophageal-scintigraphy-not-always-due-aspiration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236989,"mean":12.951701976471,"rank":193956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2362,"mean":1.0231706903854,"rank":1692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":0.74252873563218,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/877697166180925441","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21255008],"posted_on":"2017-06-22T01:18:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24767},"tweet_id":"877697166180925441"}]}}
