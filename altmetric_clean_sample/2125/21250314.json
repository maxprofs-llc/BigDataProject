With a particular focus on graphic processing units, we show that our approach allows an efficient use of CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) simultaneously, although the different architectures demand conflictive strategies in order to ensure efficient program execution. Furthermore, we present a general strategy to use large basis sets like quadruple-\u03b6 split valence on GPUs and investigate the balance between CPUs and GPUs depending on l-quantum numbers of the corresponding basis functions. Finally, we present first illustrative calculations using a hybrid CPU\/GPU environment and demonstrate the strong-scaling performance of our parallelization strategy also for pure CPU-based calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["J\u00f6rg Kussmann","Christian Ochsenfeld"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jctc.6b01166","first_seen_on":"2017-06-21T22:59:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1501334642,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jctc.6b01166"],"pmid":"28636392","pubdate":"2017-06-22T22:02:09+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"title":"Hybrid CPU\/GPU Integral Engine for Strong-Scaling Ab Initio Methods","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hybrid-cpugpu-integral-engine-strongscaling-ab-initio-methods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":3590274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4581743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227426,"mean":12.053760114323,"rank":91676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":131972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227426,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3306,"mean":1.5608012102874,"rank":557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3306,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.8321875,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
