Glycaemic index was estimated by measuring the glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration with Bio-Rad apparatus and cognition was assessed by using Addenbrook's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R), which is a neuropsychological battery.\nData was analysed with unpaired student t test. P value<0.05 is considered as statistically significant. Validity was assessed by receiver operating characteristics.\nAnalysis of data indicated more cognitive scores in the test group when compared with the control group. In test group six months practice of yogasanas and pranayama has also significantly brought down the high glycaemic values which were observed in the control group.\nThese findings allow the study to conclude that regular practice of yogasanas and pranayama has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in type 2 diabetic subjects by stabilizing blood glucose.","authors":["Rajani Nagothu","Archana Rajagopalan","Yogananda Indla","Rajesh Paluru"],"doi":"10.5455\/njppp.2017.7.0825508092016","first_seen_on":"2017-03-25T05:20:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2320-4672"],"issue":"3","journal":"National journal of physiology, pharmacy and pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1505572649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28299348","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pranayama"],"pmcid":"PMC5347393","pmid":"28299348","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Beneficial effects of yogasanas and pranayama in limiting the cognitive decline in Type 2 diabetes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.scopemed.org\/fulltextpdf.php?mno=240752","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beneficial-effects-yogasanas-pranayama-limiting-cognitive-decline-type-2-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.2,"score_history":{"1y":20.2,"6m":11.2,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.2},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
