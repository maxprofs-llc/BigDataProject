The allyl fragment in (I) is disordered, with population parameters 0.614\u2005(14) and 0.386\u2005(14) for the two positions of the central C atom. The least-squares planes through the two aromatic ring systems make a dihedral angle of 51.10\u2005(13)\u00b0 for (I) and 78.5\u2005(2)\u00b0 for (II). Intra-molecular N-H\u22efO and N-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions occur in (I). In (I), inversion dimers formed by C-H\u22efCl inter-actions are further linked into chains parallel to the b axis by C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds. Both aromatic rings are involved in \u03c0-\u03c0 inter-actions, with centroid-to-centroid distances of 3.508\u2005(3) and 3.791\u2005(3)\u2005\u00c5. In (II), inversion dimers form chains parallel to the b axis by C-H\u22efO inter-actions.","authors":["Le Thi Hong, H.","Nguyen Thu, T.","Nguyen, H.","Van Meervelt, L.","Le Thi Hong, H.","Nguyen Thu, T.","Nguyen, H.","Van Meervelt, L.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989017004285","first_seen_on":"2017-03-25T01:00:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 4","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1490403607,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989017004285"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2017\/04\/00\/rz5208\/rz5208.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5382625","pmid":"28435724","pubdate":"2017-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structures of two platinum(II) complexes containing ethyl eugenoxyacetate and 2-aminopyridine","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structures-two-platinumii-complexes-containing-ethyl-eugenoxyacetate-2aminopyridine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/845440120941629440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18092216],"posted_on":"2017-03-25T01:00:07+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"845440120941629440"}]}}
