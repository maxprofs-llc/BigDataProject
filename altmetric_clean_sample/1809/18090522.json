Two age-adjusted (non-elderly\/elderly) dose regimes of 40\/30 and 20\/15\u00a0mg were evaluated, with fewer patients assigned to 20\/15\u00a0mg. Efficacy was assessed by patient-reported outcomes (N\u00a0=\u00a01264 women, 707 men) and by polysomnography endpoints in ~75% of patients. Safety analyses by sex (N\u00a0=\u00a01744 women, 1065 men) included pooled data from the two 3-month trials plus 3-month data from a safety trial of 40\/30\u00a0mg.\nThe sex subgroup efficacy analyses mirrored the improvements seen for suvorexant 40\/30 and 20\/15\u00a0mg over placebo on patient-reported outcomes and polysomnography sleep maintenance and onset endpoints in the primary analyses; 95% CIs excluded zero in favor of suvorexant for most endpoints in both sexes, and similar efficacy was observed between sexes (95% CIs overlapped). Suvorexant was well-tolerated in women and men, although women in all treatment groups (including placebo) reported more adverse events than men. The most frequent adverse event was somnolence (women: 11.1% for 40\/30\u00a0mg, 8.5% for 20\/15\u00a0mg, 2.3% for placebo; men: 10.1% for 40\/30\u00a0mg, 3.4% for 20\/15\u00a0mg, 4.2% for placebo).\nSuvorexant was generally effective and well-tolerated in both women and men with insomnia.
