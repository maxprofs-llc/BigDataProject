Articles were excluded from further analyses if they were review or descriptive, were not primarily about refugee health status or trauma, or were only about infectious diseases. Instruments were then evaluated according to 5 criteria (purpose, construct definition, design, developmental process, reliability and validity) as described in the published literature.\nOf 394 publications identified, 183 were included for further analyses of their characteristics; 91 (49.7%) included quantitative data but did not evaluate measurement properties of instruments used in refugee research, 78 (42.6%) reported on statistical relationships between measures (presuming validity), and 14 (7.7%) were only about statistical properties of instruments. In these 183 publications, 125 different instruments were used; of these, 12 were developed in refugee research. None of these instruments fully met all 5 evaluation criteria, 3 met 4 criteria, and 5 met only 1 of the criteria. Another 8 standard instruments were designed and developed in nonrefugee populations but adapted for use in refugee research; of these, 2 met all 5 criteria and 6 met 4 criteria.\nThe majority of articles about refugee trauma or health are either descriptive or include quantitative data from instruments that have limited or untested validity and reliability in refugees. Primary limitations to accurate measurement in refugee research are the lack of theoretical bases to instruments and inattention to using and reporting sound measurement principles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c38","authors":["Hollifield, Michael","Warner, Teddy D","Lian, Nityamo","Krakow, Barry","Jenkins, Janis H","Kesler, James","Stevenson, Jayne","Westermeyer, Joseph"],"first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T22:17:20+00:00","issns":["0098-7484"],"issue":"5","journal":"JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1490393783,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12150673"],"pmid":"12150673","pubdate":"2002-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Measuring trauma and health status in refugees: a critical review.","type":"article","volume":"288","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-trauma-health-status-refugees-critical-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2159303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5101377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248176,"mean":13.334916313085,"rank":86388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":158503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248176,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20436,"mean":37.127632199657,"rank":12130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20436,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":474,"mean":110.53643128964,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":474,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":5,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
