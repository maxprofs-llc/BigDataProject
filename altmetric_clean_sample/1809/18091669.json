Studies in Neurospora crassa revealed an unusual cell-cell communication mechanism mediating this process, in which the fusion partners coordinately alternate between two physiological stages, probably related to signal sending and receiving. This \"cell dialog\" involves the alternating, oscillatory recruitment of the SO protein and the MAK-2 MAP kinase module to the apical plasma membrane of growing fusion tips. In this review video article, we show the dynamics of the fluorescent labeled proteins SO and MAK-2 and provide an animated graphical model of the \"cell dialog\" process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002922","authors":["Antonio Serrano","Hamzeh H.
