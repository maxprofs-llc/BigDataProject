Past AKI is associated with higher risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The MUC1 mucin is a large glycoprotein responsible for epithelial protection and locates to convoluted distal tubules and collecting ducts. Since MUC1 activates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in carcinoma cells, we hypothesized that MUC1 could be involved in epithelial tubular cell plasticity, a process that accompanies epithelial repair, but also participates into kidney fibrosis, histological substratum of CKD. In cultured human proximal cells and in human kidney allograft biopsies, we observed MUC1 induction in proximal tubules displaying ATN. Transient MUC1 induction localized with mesenchymal and stem-cell markers and was associated in vitro with reduced anoikis. In a mouse ischemia-reperfusion (IR) model, Muc1 expression mitigates severe tubular injury, as WT displayed less ATN than Muc1 KO mice. But, WT mice displayed more severe kidney fibrosis than Muc1 KO 28days after ischemia. Besides, sustained Muc1 expression in WT was associated with less kidney M2 macrophages. Human kidney biopsies performed within the first week (W1) of transplantation in the context of IR showed MUC1 W1 induction associated with EMT markers. Protocol biopsies performed 3months after demonstrated sustained abnormal MUC1 induction in atrophic tubules within kidney fibrosis. Altogether these data showed that sustained abnormal MUC1 induction accompanies failing epithelial repair, chronic inflammation and kidney fibrosis. In conclusion, MUC1 exerts opposite effects during kidney response to IR: first protective and then harmful.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002393","authors":["Gibier, Jean-Baptiste","H\u00e9mon, Brigitte","Fanchon, M\u00e9lanie","Gaudelot, Kelly","Pottier, Nicolas","Ringot, B\u00e9linda","Van Seuningen, Isabelle","Glowacki, Fran\u00e7ois","Cauffiez, Christelle","Blum, David","Copin, Marie-Christine","Perrais, Micha\u00ebl","Gnemmi, Viviane","Jean-Baptiste Gibier","Brigitte H\u00e9mon","M\u00e9lanie Fanchon","Kelly Gaudelot","Nicolas Pottier","B\u00e9linda Ringot","Isabelle Van Seuningen","Fran\u00e7ois Glowacki","Christelle Cauffiez","David Blum","Marie-Christine Copin","Micha\u00ebl Perrais","Viviane Gnemmi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbadis.2017.03.023","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T06:22:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0925-4439","0006-3002","09254439"],"journal":"BBA - Molecular Basis of Disease","last_mentioned_on":1501804533,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbadis.2017.03.023","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28366875?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925443917301102?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"28366875","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Dual role of MUC1 mucin in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury: Nephroprotector in early phase, but pro-fibrotic in late phase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dual-role-muc1-mucin-kidney-ischemiareperfusion-injury-nephroprotector-early-phase-profibrotic-late"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3939025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4193577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246926,"mean":13.065298726334,"rank":117367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":122322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246926,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":2.6331071428571,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.7552916666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/collecting_duct\/statuses\/849201264541945857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18417584],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T10:05:33+00:00","author":{"name":"collectingDuct","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"collecting_duct","tweeter_id":"2796360695","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":24},"tweet_id":"849201264541945857"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Ijeb\/statuses\/893259073470083073","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18417584],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T23:55:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Gibier","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/758346138885951488\/tbhY3DqF_normal.jpg","description":"Pathologist in training at CHRU de Lille\nMember of INSERM UMR S1172.\nSpecial interest in kidney.","id_on_source":"Ijeb","tweeter_id":"8993472","geo":{"lt":50.63297,"ln":3.05858,"country":"FR"},"followers":204},"tweet_id":"893259073470083073"}]}}
