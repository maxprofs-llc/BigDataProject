To explore the acceptability of the program, we showed volunteers the first two lessons and asked for their views.\nFocus groups (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and individual interviews (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were undertaken with 15 participants (11 survivors) with mainly breast (11 of the 15) cancer, who had reviewed intervention materials. Participants were asked to consider the acceptability of the iCBT program content and implementation design (timing, duration). Semi-structured questions guided discussion. Thematic analysis was conducted of participant reactions to the acceptability and\/or suitability of materials created for use in a psychological intervention. We took a data-driven (inductive) approach to semantic theme development across the data set.\nParticipants reported high acceptability of the internet delivery format, good engagement and user-friendly material. Participants were broadly supportive of combining depression and anxiety iCBT resources for early-stage cancer patients and survivors. Participants further indicated that a separate course would be needed to address the needs of patients with advanced stage disease.\nParticipants welcomed the general development of an internet-delivered CBT intervention program to treat patients with clinical depression and\/or anxiety. Furthermore, the sessions reviewed were highly acceptable to all participants. Study findings informed researchers on the development of iCBT resources for the cancer community.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","authors":["A. Karageorge","M. J. Murphy","J. M.
