Delays in diagnosis can lead to potentially devastating morbidity.No single investigation, including joint aspiration, is sufficiently reliable to diagnose conclusively paediatric bone and joint infection. Diagnosis should be based on a combination of clinical signs, imaging and laboratory investigations. Algorithms should supplement, and not replace, clinical decision making in all cases.The roles of aspiration, arthrotomy and arthroscopy in the treatment of septic arthritis are not clearly defined. There is a very limited role for surgery in the management of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis.The ideal duration and mode of administration of antibiotic therapy for osteoarticular paediatric infection is not yet fully defined but there is increasing evidence that shorter courses (three weeks) and early conversion (day four) to oral administration is safe and effective in appropriate cases. Clear and concise antibiotic guidelines should be available based on local population characteristics, pathogens and their sensitivities.Kingella kingae is increasingly identified through polymerase chain reaction and is now recognised as the commonest pathogen in children aged under four years. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing strains of Staph. aureus are being increasingly reported.A multidisciplinary integrated evidence-based approach is required to optimise outcomes.Further large-scale, multicentre studies are needed to delineate the optimal management of paediatric osteoarticular infection.
