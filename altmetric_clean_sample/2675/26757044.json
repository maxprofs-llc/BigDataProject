Associations between p16 IHC and tumour site, behavioural risk factors, demographic characteristics, and HIV status were examined.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, 77 HNSCC cases were identified. Mean age was 52 years, 50 cases (65%) were male, and 48 (62%) were in the oropharynx (OP) or oral cavity (OC). HIV status was known for 35 patients (45%), with 5 (14%) HIV-infected. Substance use was known for 40 patients (52%), with 38% reporting any tobacco and 31% any alcohol. Forty-two cases (55%) had adequate tissue for p16 IHC, of which seven (17%) were positive, including 22% of OP\/OC tumours.\nDespite high cervical cancer burden, HPV-associated HNSCC is not very common in Malawi.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080a9","authors":["Faggons, Claire E","Mabedi, Charles E","Liomba, N George","Funkhouser, William K","Chimzimu, Fred","Kampani, Coxcilly","Krysiak, Robert","Msiska, Nelson","Shores, Carol G","Gopal, Satish"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-29T13:28:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1995-7270"],"issue":"2","journal":"Malawi Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1506690634,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28955422?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28955422","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Human papillomavirus in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A descriptive study of histologically confirmed cases at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-papillomavirus-head-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-descriptive-study-histologically-confirmed-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":7311867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111394,"mean":11.430589785714,"rank":90455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111394,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.7534482758621,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/913752865348268032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26757044],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T13:10:34+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":389},"tweet_id":"913752865348268032"}]}}
