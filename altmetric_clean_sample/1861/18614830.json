This study aims to explore the potential link between smoking and TB infection using baseline survey data of a large-scale population-based prospective study in rural China.\nBetween July 1 and Sept 30, 2013, based on the baseline survey of a population-based, prospective study in rural China, the relationship between smoking and TB infection, assessed by interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), was investigated among the total study population and only among those smokers, respectively.\nA total of 21,008 eligible rural registered residents (\u2265 5 years old) from 4 rural sites were included in the analysis. Ever-smokers were more likely to be QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) positive than never smokers with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.49). Among ever smokers, a significant linear dose-response relation was observed between duration of smoking (by years) and QFT positivity (p < 0.001). Stratified analysis suggested that such an association was not influenced by gender and age. Evidence for interaction of smoking status with age was found.\nOur results provide further evidence to support smoking might increase host susceptibility to TB infection. Populations under high risk of infection, such as elderly smokers, should be prior to TB infection controlling under a premise of community level intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Haoran Zhang","Henan Xin","Xiangwei Li","Hengjing Li","Mufei Li","Wei Lu","Liqiong Bai","Xinhua Wang","Jianmin Liu","Qi Jin","Lei Gao"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0175183","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T23:00:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1492786836,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175183"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175183&type=printable","pmid":"28384350","pubdate":"2017-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0175183","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A dose-response relationship of smoking with tuberculosis infection: A cross-sectional study among 21008 rural residents in China","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doseresponse-relationship-smoking-tuberculosis-infection-crosssectional-study-among-21008-rural-resi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":2.75,"6m":2.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":3189189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4869827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238438,"mean":13.027910424976,"rank":86630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":150570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238438,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112649,"mean":10.567797404304,"rank":41387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":70296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112649,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4621,"mean":10.480554978355,"rank":1556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4621,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SerenitySmokes\/statuses\/850483327387684864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18614830],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T23:00:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Serenity Smoke Shop","url":"http:\/\/serenitysmokeshop.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/679714974122430464\/zVJ4ZNhh_normal.jpg","description":"Please contact us with questions.","id_on_source":"SerenitySmokes","tweeter_id":"3029236911","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":29},"tweet_id":"850483327387684864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Spectromics\/statuses\/855424701946093568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18614830],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T14:15:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Spectromics","url":"http:\/\/www.spectromics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/504665166009491456\/A-nb0ymy_normal.jpeg","description":"A Smarter Approach to Tackling Microbial Resistance to Antibiotics","id_on_source":"Spectromics","tweeter_id":"2427183980","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":734},"tweet_id":"855424701946093568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BugsUnderStress\/statuses\/855436110486319104","license":"gnip","rt":["Spectromics"],"citation_ids":[18614830],"posted_on":"2017-04-21T15:00:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbial Stress","url":"https:\/\/bugsunderstressblog.wordpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/798483329251057664\/N77dzzFO_normal.jpg","description":"All about Microbial stress, Toxin-Antitoxins, Biofilms, Antibiotic Resistance, Persistence and Microbiome.
