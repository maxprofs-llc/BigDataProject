APOL1 has two sets of sequence variants which are risk factors for kidney disease development, APOL1G1 (substitution mutation) and APOL1G2 (deletion mutation). Our present study focuses on the impact of these variants on APOL1 mRNA transcription and translation. APOL1 plasmids (EV, G0, G1, and G2) were transfected into HEK 293T cells. APOL1 variant expression was observed to be significantly lower than that of APOL1G0. Podocyte cell lines stably expressing APOL1 transgenes also showed lower levels of APOL1 expression of APOL1 variants (G1 and G2) compared to APOL1G0 by Western blot\u00a0ting, and FACS analysis. The enhanced expression of GRP78 by podocytes expressing APOL1 variants would indicate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Bioinformatics evaluation using two different programs (MUPro and I-Mutant 2.0) predicted that APOL1 variants were less stable than APOL1 G0. Concomitant with protein levels, APOL1 mRNA levels were also depressed following induction of APOL1 variant compared to APOL1 G0 in both proliferating and differentiated pod\\ocytes. APOL1 mRNA transcript stability was tested after actinomycin D pulsing; APOL1G1 and APOL1G2 mRNAs transcript decayed 10-15 % and 15-20% (within a period of 0.5 hours \u00a0to 3 hours), respectively. Our data suggest that down regulated APOL1 protein expression in APOL1 variants is due to compromised transcription and decay of the APOL1 variant transcripts. \u00a0 .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f6","authors":["Shabirul Haque","Gauri Patil","Abheepsa Mishra","Xiqian Lan","Waldemar Popik","Ashwani Malhotra","Karl Skorecki","Pravin C Singhal","Pravin\u00a0C.
