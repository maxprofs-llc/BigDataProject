Using transgenic mice overexpressing yellow fluorescent protein and transcranial two-photon microscopy, we repeatedly imaged dendritic spines on the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. In young adolescent mice (1-month-old), 13%-20% of spines were eliminated and 5%-8% formed over 2 weeks in barrel, motor, and frontal cortices, indicating a cortical-wide spine loss during this developmental period. As animals mature, there is also a substantial loss of dendritic filopodia involved in spinogenesis. In adult mice (4-6 months old), 3%-5% of spines were eliminated and formed over 2 weeks in various cortical regions. Over 18 months, only 26% of spines were eliminated and 19% formed in adult barrel cortex. Thus, after a concurrent loss of spines and spine precursors in diverse regions of young adolescent cortex, spines become stable and a majority of them can last throughout life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","authors":["Yi Zuo","Aerie Lin","Paul Chang","Wen-Biao Gan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2005.04.001","endpage":"189","issns":["08966273","0896-6273"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1434997989,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WSS-4G0CDMK-6&_user=10&_coverDate=04%2F21%2F2005&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=6cc4450601421010e66e76474a8dd8e3","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuron.2005.04.001","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15848798","http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0896-6273(05)00309-0"],"pmid":"15848798","pubdate":"2005-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"181","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Development of Long-Term Dendritic Spine Stability in Diverse Regions of Cerebral Cortex","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-longterm-dendritic-spine-stability-diverse-regions-cerebral-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.496,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.496},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263558,"mean":6.1954866878068,"rank":329343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4934238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263558,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4296899,"mean":6.9731880924356,"rank":309186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3987694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4296899,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4149,"mean":16.093355834137,"rank":871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4149,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3554,"mean":17.059599774838,"rank":801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3554,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":81,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
