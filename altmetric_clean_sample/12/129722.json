Different strategies were used in relation to regional lymph nodes. It was found that prophylactic lymphadenectomy in terms of more than 4 weeks after excision of primary cutaneous melanoma reliably prolongs total and recurrence-free survival as compared with the method without fulfilling prophylactic lymphadenectomy. Prophylactic lymphadenectomy fulfilled in terms less than 4 weeks fails to have statistically significant influence on the results of treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91f3cf058f61000d6d5","authors":["I R Akhmetov","A V Vazhenin","S V Ia\u012dtsev","A V Privalov"],"issns":["0042-4625"],"issue":"1","journal":"Vestnik khirurgii imeni I I Grekova","last_mentioned_on":1308220032,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21506347?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21506347","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Preventive lymphadenectomy in complex treatment of melanoma of the skin, trunk and extremities].","type":"article","volume":"170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preventive-lymphadenectomy-complex-treatment-melanoma-skin-trunk-extremities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.9297103293237,"rank":2016102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2718605,"mean":5.1708577659735,"rank":1474832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":734345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2718605,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.77717391304348,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.75,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/melanoma_news\/status\/81306823843524609","citation_ids":[129722],"posted_on":"2011-06-16T10:27:12+00:00","author":{"name":"ACOR Melanoma News","image":"http:\/\/a3.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1367655725\/pm_bigger_normal.png","description":"ACOR Melanoma New Abstracts & News Service","id_on_source":"melanoma_news","tweeter_id":"18981530","followers":373},"tweet_id":"81306823843524609"}]}}
