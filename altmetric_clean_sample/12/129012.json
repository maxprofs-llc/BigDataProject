To perform this full quantum operation while preserving and retrieving the fragile nonclassicality of the input state, we have developed a broadband, zero-dispersion teleportation apparatus that works in conjunction with time-resolved state preparation equipment. Our approach brings within experimental reach a whole new set of hybrid protocols involving discrete- and continuous-variable techniques in quantum information processing for optical sciences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Sci...332..330L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","arxiv_id":"1205.6253","authors":["Noriyuki Lee","Hugo Benichi","Yuishi Takeno","Shuntaro Takeda","James Webb","Elanor Huntington","Akira Furusawa","Lee N","Benichi H","Takeno Y","Takeda S","Webb J","Huntington E","Furusawa A"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1201034","endpage":"333","issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"6027","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1433846404,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/332\/6027\/330.abstract","http:\/\/m.sciencemag.org\/content\/332\/6027\/330.abstract","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1205.6253","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.1201034"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/332\/6027\/330.full.pdf","pmid":"21493853","pubdate":"2011-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"330","subjects":["science"],"title":"Teleportation of Nonclassical Wave Packets of Light","type":"article","volume":"332","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/teleportation-nonclassical-wave-packets-light"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155462,"mean":6.8923476161488,"rank":480163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7673885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155462,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7528030,"mean":7.2129516841601,"rank":468465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7058030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7528030,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41206,"mean":32.890091493751,"rank":11224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":29966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41206,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38515,"mean":34.9038919354,"rank":11183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":27316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38515,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
