The authors present a review on the chemistry of CBD and discuss the anticonvulsive, antianxiety, antipsychotic, antinausea, and antirheumatoid arthritic properties of CBD. CBD does not bind to the known cannabinoid receptors, and its mechanism of action is yet unknown. It is possible that, in part at least, its effects are due to its recently discovered inhibition of anandamide uptake and hydrolysis and to its antioxidative effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d05","authors":["Raphael Mechoulam","Linda A Parker","Ruth Gallily"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0091-2700"],"issue":"11 Suppl","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1208308788,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12412831"],"pmid":"12412831","pubdate":"2002-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American College of Clinical Pharmacology; 1999","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Cannabidiol: an overview of some pharmacological aspects.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cannabidiol-overview-some-pharmacological-aspects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4241072,"mean":5.1325555667987,"rank":404842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3808090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4241072,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3221780,"mean":5.6997986619831,"rank":348628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2850216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3221780,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":484,"mean":2.7725962732919,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":484,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":2.9210473815461,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
