On a volunteer's forearm, 0.1 mL of oil was applied per 30 cm2 of exposed skin. When the tested oils were applied at a 10% or 50% concentration, none of them prevented mosquito bites for as long as 2 h, but the undiluted oils of Cymbopogon nardus (citronella), Pogostemon cablin (patchuli), Syzygium aromaticum (clove) and Zanthoxylum limonella (Thai name: makaen) were the most effective and provided 2 h of complete repellency. From these initial results, three concentrations (10%, 50% and undiluted) of citronella, patchouli, clove and makaen were selected for repellency tests against Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles dirus. As expected, the undiluted oil showed the highest protection in each case. Clove oil gave the longest duration of 100% repellency (2-4 h) against all three species of mosquito.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["Yuwadee Trongtokit","Yupha Rongsriyam","Narumon Komalamisra","Chamnarn Apiwathnasorn","Trongtokit Y","Rongsriyam Y","Komalamisra N","Apiwathnasorn C","Trongtokit, Yuwadee","Rongsriyam, Yupha","Komalamisra, Narumon","Apiwathnasorn, Chamnarn"],"doi":"10.1002\/ptr.1637","endpage":"309","isbns":[],"issns":["0951-418X","1099-1573"],"issue":"4","journal":"Phytotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1496618868,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16041723","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ptr.1637","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.1637\/abstract;jsessionid=8E86189FF7EEBFD489E56A60C54D6B61.d01t01?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage&userIsAuthenticated=false","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.1637\/abstract;jsessionid=E7132A5FF1A1C201C531D774B46A9B82.f03t02","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16041723"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.1637\/pdf","pmid":"16041723","pubdate":"2005-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"303","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Comparative repellency of 38 essential oils against mosquito bites.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ptr.1637","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-repellent-products-against-caged-free-flying-anopheles-stephensi-mosquitoes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":120.564,"score_history":{"1y":39,"6m":2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":120.564},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":66644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8250850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684983,"mean":7.330780906701,"rank":65852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7619131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684983,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1364,"mean":5.6003756419663,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1364,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1339,"mean":6.0098923766816,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1339,"percentile":99}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":17,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":17,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
