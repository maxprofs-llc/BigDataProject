Its diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, which have a limited sensitivity. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels have been suggested as a marker of VOD. We aimed to prospectively evaluate how the fibrinolytic parameters behaved to discriminate VOD from other liver disorders occurring after HSCT in a pediatric population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Maria Teresa Sartori","Simone Cesaro","Mattia Peruzzo","Chiara Messina","Graziella Saggiorato","Elisabetta Calore","Marta Pillon","Stefania Varotto","Luca Spiezia","Giuseppe Cella"],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.23213","issns":["1545-5017"],"journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1308237875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21674760?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21674760","pubdate":"2011-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Contribution of fibrinolytic tests to the differential diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease complicating pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-fibrinolytic-tests-differential-diagnosis-venoocclusive-disease-complicating-pediatric"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505402,"mean":5.1012628106873,"rank":3158588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1021224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505402,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3440914,"mean":5.7251933516494,"rank":2416454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":785174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3440914,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1315,"mean":1.8255296803653,"rank":924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1315,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":939,"mean":1.8641066098081,"rank":619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":939,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
