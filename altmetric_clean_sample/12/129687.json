The technical improvement of the draw tower grating (DTG) process today results in highly reliable and cost-effective Bragg gratings for versatile application in the optical fiber sensor market. Because of the single-pulse exposure of the fiber, the gratings behave typically like type I gratings with respect to their temperature stability. This means that such gratings only work up to temperatures of about 300\u2009\u00b0C. To increase temperature stability, we combined DTG arrays with hydrogen postloading and a thermal regeneration process that enables their use in high-temperature environments. The regenerated draw tower gratings are demonstrated to be suitable for temperatures of more than 800\u2009\u00b0C.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011ApOpt..50.2519L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5693cf058f610004b13","authors":["Eric Lindner","John Canning","Christoph Chojetzki","Sven Br\u00fcckner","Martin Becker","Manfred Rothhardt","Hartmut Bartelt","Lindner, Eric","Canning, John","Chojetzki, Christoph","Br\u00fcckner, Sven","Becker, Martin","Rothhardt, Manfred","Bartelt, Hartmut"],"doi":"10.1364\/ao.50.002519","first_seen_on":"2011-08-10T20:00:09+00:00","issns":["0003-6935","1539-4522"],"issue":"17","journal":"Applied Optics","last_mentioned_on":1307676741,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1364\/AO.50.002519","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21673753?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21673753","pubdate":"2011-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"OSA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2519","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Post-hydrogen-loaded draw tower fiber Bragg gratings and their thermal regeneration.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posthydrogenloaded-draw-tower-fiber-bragg-gratings-thermal-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6884633,"mean":6.1793935007687,"rank":5897715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6884633,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68356,"mean":5.6681939580133,"rank":58231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68356,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":803,"mean":5.7546932668329,"rank":674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":803,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.925,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
