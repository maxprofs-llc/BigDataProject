All children had normal high resolution karyotype, DNA fra-X analysis, brain MRI, metabolic work-up, and physical\/neurological examination. Subtelomeric analysis did not detect abnormalities in any of the subjects, suggesting the uselessness of such investigations in individuals with primary autism spectrum disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f61000697f","doi":"10.1002\/ajmg.c.30077","endpage":"12","issns":["1552-4876"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Medical Genetics.
