The participants were 159 adults living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Each participated in a structured interview to assess all sexual and drug-use behavior over a 3-month period. Analysis of 3,026 sexual behaviors reported by 123 sexually active participants indicated that at the global level, participants who drank more heavily were more likely to have engaged in sexual risk behavior. At the event level, however, alcohol use was not related to condom use during vaginal or anal intercourse; that is, participants who used condoms when sober tended to use them to the same extent when drinking.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8df3cf058f61000c7fc","authors":["Lance S.
