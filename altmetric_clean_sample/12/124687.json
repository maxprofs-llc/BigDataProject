The recent positional cloning and localization of the golden gene, combined with genotype-phenotype correlations of alleles of its human orthologue (SLC24A5) in African-American and African-Caribbean populations, provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of human skin colour. SLC24A5 promotes melanin deposition through maturation of the melanosome, highlighting the importance of ion-exchange in the function of this organelle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["R STURM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tig.2006.06.010","endpage":"468","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["01689525","0168-9525"],"issue":"9","journal":"Trends in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1499647860,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TCY-4KF780Y-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c39582b9f961afc107a5a51137475ac5","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tig.2006.06.010","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16857289"],"pmid":"16857289","pubdate":"2006-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"464","title":"A golden age of human pigmentation genetics","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/golden-age-human-pigmentation-genetics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.576,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":5.08,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.576},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187776,"mean":6.9233436649085,"rank":611981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7575811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187776,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7557889,"mean":7.2454030583619,"rank":595470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6962401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7557889,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":7.1198895582329,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":7.2064575569358,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
