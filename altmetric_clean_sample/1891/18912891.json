In this synergistic catalysis, Rh(I) and Ag(I) catalysts selectively activate keto-VDCP substrates and terminal alkynes to generate \uf070-allyl Rh(III) complex of oxa-rhodacyclic intermediate and Ag alkynyl intermediate, respectively. The rapid transmetalation of alkynyl groups from Ag to Rh is proposed to play a key role to realize the regioselective cleavage of distal bond of the three-membered ring in this transformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Song Yang","Kang-Hua Rui","Xiang-Ying Tang","Qin Xu","Min Shi"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b02027","first_seen_on":"2017-04-17T19:57:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1492459027,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.7b02027"],"pmid":"28387514","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Rhodium\/Silver Synergistic Catalysis in Highly Enantioselective Cycloisomerization\/Cross Coupling of Keto-Vinylidenecyclopropanes with Terminal Alkynes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rhodiumsilver-synergistic-catalysis-highly-enantioselective-cycloisomerizationcross-coupling-ketovin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":6993305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232666,"mean":12.777302258612,"rank":189399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232666,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18842,"mean":5.2453834722148,"rank":16725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18842,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255,"mean":11.913952755906,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
