There was no difference between open (17.85) and laparoscopic (18.91) approaches (p\u00a0=\u00a00.171) in the number of lymph nodes harvested. Patients who had more nodes removed tended toward improved survival, independent of stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.052), an effect that was more pronounced in the open resection group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). There was no difference in survival between the open and laparoscopic groups overall (HR 1.52, p\u00a0=\u00a00.208).\nNo survival advantage was found between the open and laparoscopic resection groups, affirming that the choice of operative approach for CRC does not affect the quality of the oncologic procedure in a community hospital setting. Patients who had more lymph nodes removed tended toward improved survival. The explanation for this effect remains unclear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["S.
