A recent cross-sectional study demonstrated an association between low C-peptide serum levels and low lumbar bone density of postmenopausal women not affected by diabetes. To date, very little research attention has been directed toward the association between C-peptide and osteoporotic fractures. To contribute toward filling this gap, we investigated the association between C-peptide and fractures in postmenopausal women.\nA cohort of 133 non-diabetic postmenopausal women with and without a history of fractures was evaluated in this cross-sectional investigation. Standardized interviews were performed to gather information on the patients' fracture history. All of the participants underwent a bone mineral density assessment by DXA, radiographs, and a serum C-peptide measurement.\nThirty-four women presented fractures. Bivariate analysis revealed an inverse correlation between C-peptide and fractures (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). A significant difference in mean C-peptide levels was also found between women with vs. without fractures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, adjusted for age, BMI and glucose). Logistic regression analysis showed that C-peptide levels, femoral and vertebral BMD were all negatively associated with fracture status (B\u00a0=\u00a0-1.097, ES\u00a0=\u00a00.401, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, 95% CI 0.15-0.73; B\u00a0=\u00a0-15.6, SE\u00a0=\u00a04.17, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, CI 0.001-0.002; B\u00a0=\u00a0-24.8, SE\u00a0=\u00a05.23, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, CI 0001-0.002; respectively).\nThis study confirms an inverse association between serum C-peptide levels and a history of fractures in postmenopausal women without diabetes. These results suggest that C-peptidemay exert an effect on bone mineral density. However, further large-scale studies are needed to corroborate this finding and investigate the potential underlying mechanisms involved.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c5b","authors":["Y.
