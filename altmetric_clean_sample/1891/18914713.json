Milk samples (n = 15) were experimentally contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli to have bacterial counts ranging from 10(3) to 10(9) cfu\/mL. These contaminated milk samples were subjected to a preparation protocol for bacterial ribosomal protein extraction using the MALDI Sepsityper kit (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), which allowed MALDI-TOF MS coupled with Biotyper software (Bruker Daltonik) to identify bacterial fingerprints based on intact ribosomal proteins. The ability of MALDI-TOF MS to correctly identify bacterial strains from experimentally contaminated milk (without previous microbiological culture) depended on the bacterial count of the samples and on the species of the bacteria evaluated. Adequate identification at the bacterial species level (score \u22652.0) directly from milk samples required bacterial counts in the following ranges: \u226510(6) cfu\/mL of Staph. aureus, \u226510(7) cfu\/mL of E. coli, and \u226510(8) cfu\/mL of Strep. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. uberis. We concluded that direct identification of mastitis-causing pathogens is possible for Staph. aureus, E. coli, Strep. agalactiae, Strep. dysgalactiae, and Strep. uberis, but correct identification depended on the bacterial count in the milk samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["Juliana Regina Barreiro","Juliano Leonel Gon\u00e7alves","Patr\u00edcia Aparecida Campos Braga","Aline Gerato Dibbern","Marcos Nogueira Eberlin","Marcos Veiga dos Santos"],"doi":"10.3168\/jds.2016-11741","first_seen_on":"2017-04-17T23:14:40+00:00","issns":["00220302"],"journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","last_mentioned_on":1493894440,"links":["http:\/\/www.journalofdairyscience.org\/article\/S0022-0302(17)30094-2\/abstract"],"pmid":"28161160","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Non-culture-based identification of mastitis-causing bacteria by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonculturebased-identification-mastitiscausing-bacteria-malditof-mass-spectrometry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":1.95,"6m":1.95,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155745,"mean":6.9068271228166,"rank":3630215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4521392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155745,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236877,"mean":12.836949382799,"rank":101910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":134750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236877,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":2.8205495824635,"rank":1483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":3.1322611940299,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
