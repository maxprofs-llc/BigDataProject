Sixteen young (8 men (YM), 8 women (YW); 18-24 yrs) and older (8 men (OM), 8 women (OW); 60-73 yrs) adults performed inspiratory resistive breathing tasks (IRBTs) at 2% and 65% of their maximal inspiratory pressure. During the IRBTs, breathing frequency was 20 breaths min-1 with a 50% duty cycle. At baseline and during the IRBTs, MAP was measured via automated oscillometry, Q\u0307L was determined via Doppler ultrasound, and LVR was calculated. The 65% IRBT led to significantly greater increases in MAP in OW (15.9\u00b18.1mmHg) compared to YW (6.9\u00b11.4mmHg), but not (p>0.05) between OM (12.3\u00b15.7mmHg) and YM (10.8\u00b15.7 mmHg). OW (-20.2\u00b17.2%) had greater (p<0.05) decreases in Q\u0307L compared to YW (-9.4\u00b110.2%), but no significant differences were present between OM (-22.8\u00b19.7%) and YM (-22.7\u00b111.3%) during the 65% IRBT. The 65% IRBT led to greater (p<0.05) increases in LVR in OW (48.2\u00b125.5%) compared to YW (19.7\u00b115.0%), but no differences (p>0.05) existed among OM (54.4\u00b117.8%) and YM (47.1\u00b123.3%). No significant differences were present in MAP, Q\u0307L, or LVR between OM and OW. These data suggest OW exhibit a greater inspiratory muscle metaboreflex compared to YW, while no differences between OM and YM existed. Lastly, sex differences in the inspiratory muscle metaboreflex are not present in older adults.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Joshua R. Smith","Andrew M.
