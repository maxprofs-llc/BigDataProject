A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for histidine-rich glycoprotein has been developed and used to demonstrate that histidine-rich glycoprotein is present in human platelets. Histidine-rich glycoprotein was detected and quantified in detergent extracts of washed human platelets, with a mean level of 371 ng\/10(9) platelets. Plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein, either in the platelet suspending medium or on the surface of the platelets, accounted for less than 3.4% of the detectable platelet histidine-rich glycoprotein. Histidine-rich glycoprotein was also demonstrated in human bone marrow megakaryocytes by immunofluorescence. The extent of histidine-rich glycoprotein release from platelets was dependent on the thrombin dose and correlated directly with the extent of serotonin release. The platelet and plasma histidine-rich glycoprotein were similar by immunochemical analysis. Anti-histidine-rich glycoprotein IgG did not inhibit platelet aggregation. Histidine-rich glycoprotein released by platelets following thrombin stimulation may play a significant role in modulating inflammatory events in the microenvironment of the platelet plug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Leung, L L","Harpel, P C","Nachman, R L","Rabellino, E M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-10T14:44:11+00:00","issns":["0006-4971"],"issue":"5","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1494427436,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/6414553\/?from=%2F2654562%2Frelated&i=2"],"pmid":"6414553","pubdate":"1983-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Histidine-rich glycoprotein is present in human platelets and is released following thrombin stimulation.","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histidinerich-glycoprotein-present-human-platelets-released-following-thrombin-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":6214384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1101680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237803,"mean":12.404234741507,"rank":168234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237803,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9691,"mean":5.6064660474716,"rank":7927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9691,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":6.5320930232558,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
