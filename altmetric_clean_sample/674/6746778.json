A review of published reports regarding screening recommendations for MRI for patients with IOFB is provided. A minimum recommendation is for prescreening questionnaire; belief of the patient history is critical. If there is any doubt after history and examination by an ophthalmologist, then computed tomography imaging of the orbits is recommended. Whether screening by plain X-ray imaging is worthwhile is debatable as the sensitivity and specificity of this modality is poor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000254b","authors":["Vote, B J","Simpson, A J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T23:05:14+00:00","issns":["1442-6404"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1460751517,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11545429"],"pmid":"11545429","pubdate":"2001-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"X-ray turns a blind eye to ferrous metal.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xray-turns-blind-eye-ferrous-metal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":5451628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1836357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268607,"mean":11.350978704869,"rank":173213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":80078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268607,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":2.6654859437751,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.4788461538462,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/majorajay\/statuses\/721069936894869504","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6746778],"posted_on":"2016-04-15T20:17:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Ajay Major, MD, MBA","url":"http:\/\/majorajay.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1868093569\/twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Internal medicine resident.
