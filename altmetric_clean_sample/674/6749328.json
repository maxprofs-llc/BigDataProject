R-LOX are widespread in aquatic invertebrates, in some of which their R-HETE products have a defined role in reproductive function. A 12R-LOX has been found recently in humans and mice. The human 12R-LOX product, 12R-HETE, appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis and other proliferative skin diseases; a role in normal skin development is implied from the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the 12R-LOX in the mouse embryo. In plants, there are few reports of R-LOX activity and in higher plants this is limited to enzymes that catalyze a significant degree of non-specific oxygenation. There are no obvious amino acid sequence motifs characterizing R-LOXs; and in the phylogenetic tree of the LOX superfamily, the R-LOXs do not group into a specific branch of genes. The mechanistic basis of stereocontrol over the oxygenation reaction performed by LOXs may relate to a changed binding orientation of the fatty acid substrate or to the direction of attack by molecular oxygen. A potentially relevant precedent for switching of R- and S-oxygenation specificity was described recently in studies of prostaglandin C-15 oxygenation during cycloxygenase catalysis; single amino acid changes can invert the oxygenation stereospecificity at C-15. In this case, the evidence suggests that R\/S switching can occur with the substrate binding in the normal conformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033c4","authors":["Schneider, Claus","Brash, Alan R"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T02:52:15+00:00","issns":["1098-8823"],"journal":"Prostaglandins & Other Lipid Mediators","last_mentioned_on":1461245233,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12432924"],"pmid":"12432924","pubdate":"2002-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Lipoxygenase-catalyzed formation of R-configuration hydroperoxides.","type":"article","volume":"68-69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lipoxygenasecatalyzed-formation-rconfiguration-hydroperoxides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":1836434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4736726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245047,"mean":11.79304639129,"rank":79826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":161839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245047,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":2.7074326241135,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
