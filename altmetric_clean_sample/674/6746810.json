This unit shows how GC-MS-based metabolomics allows integration of targeted assays for absolute quantification of specific metabolites with untargeted metabolomics to discover novel compounds. Complemented by database annotations using large spectral libraries and validated standard operating procedures, GC-MS can identify and semiquantify over 200 compounds from human body fluids (e.g., plasma, urine, or stool) per study. Deconvolution software enables detection of more than 300 additional unidentified signals that can be annotated through accurate mass instruments with appropriate data processing workflows, similar to untargeted profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. GC-MS is a mature technology that uses not only classic detectors (quadrupole) but also target mass spectrometers (triple quadrupole) and accurate mass instruments (quadrupole-time of flight). This unit covers sample preparation from mammalian samples, data acquisition, quality control, and data processing. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc9c","authors":["Fiehn, Oliver"],"doi":"10.1002\/0471142727.mb3004s114","endpage":"30.4.32","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T23:06:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1934-3647"],"journal":"Current protocols in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1462025487,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/0471142727.mb3004s114\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/0471142727.mb3004s114\/pdf","pmid":"27038389","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"30.4.1","subjects":["molecularbiology","clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology","type":"article","volume":"114","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolomics-gas-chromatographymass-spectrometry-combined-targeted-untargeted-profiling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":2936290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4667184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269617,"mean":11.353028484956,"rank":94788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":173562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269617,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.5748541666667,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
