Eligible infants (alive or deceased) were born 9-18 months before each survey to mothers \u226516 years old. We randomly selected mother-infant pairs and conducted questionnaires, verbal autopsies and collected blood samples. We estimated: 1) the HIV-free infant survival and MTCT rate within each CA and compared the 2012 and 2014 estimates using a paired t-test, 2) number of HIV infections averted due to the intervention.\nWe analyzed 7,249 mother-infant pairs with viable maternal specimens collected in 2012 and 8,551 in 2014. The mean difference in the CA-level MTCT between 2014 and 2012 was -5.2 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI)\u200a=\u200a-8.1,-2.3, p\u200a<\u200a0.001). The mean difference in the CA-level HIV-free survival was 5.5 percentage points (95%CI\u200a=\u200a2.6,8.5, p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Between 2012 and 2014, 1,779 infant infections were averted compared to the pre-Option A regimen. The association between HIV-free infant survival and duration of Option A implementation was not significant at the multivariate level (p\u200a=\u200a0.093).\nWe found a substantial and statistically significant increase in HIV-free survival and decrease in MTCT among infants aged 9-18 months following Option A rollout in Zimbabwe. This is the only impact evaluation of Option A and shows the effectiveness of Option A and Zimbabwe's remarkable progress towards eMTCT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Buzdugan, Raluca","Dufour, Mi-Suk Kang","Mccoy, Sandra I","Watadzaushe, Constancia","Dirawo, Jeffrey","Mushavi, Angela","Mujuru, Hilda Angela","Mahomva, Agnes","Kangwende, Rugare Abigail","Hakobyan, Anna","Mugurungi, Owen","Cowan, Frances M","Padian, Nancy S","Kang Dufour, Mi-Suk","McCoy, Sandra I.","Cowan, Frances M.","Padian, Nancy S."],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000001111","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T00:01:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5571","0269-9370"],"issue":"10","journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1468604150,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Option_A_improved_HIV_free_infant_survival_and.97802.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/2016\/06190\/Option_A_improved_HIV_free_infant_survival_and.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/9000\/00000\/Option_A_improved_HIV_free_infant_survival_and.97802.pdf","pmid":"27058354","pubdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Option A improved HIV-free infant survival and mother to child HIV transmission at 9-18 months in zimbabwe.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Option_A_improved_HIV_free_infant_survival_and.97802.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/option-improved-hivfree-infant-survival-mother-child-hiv-transmission-918-months-zimbabwe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":3473017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4488756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248099,"mean":11.951506501463,"rank":100562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":143186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248099,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3519,"mean":4.8358436611711,"rank":2377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3519,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":4.3669117647059,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
