Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale at baseline and 5 and 12\u00a0months later. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics were retrieved from registers. A trajectory finite mixture model was used to identify trajectories.\nThe trajectories of depressive symptoms over time were analyzed in 546 patients and 508 partners. Among patients, 13\u00a0% had a high stable trajectory, 38\u00a0% an intermediate decreasing trajectory, and 49\u00a0% a low trajectory. Similar trajectories were found for partners (11, 22, and 67\u00a0%, respectively). Compared to the low trajectory, trajectories with higher depressive symptoms were associated with poorer relationship quality and previous use of antidepressants for patients and partners and with younger age, comorbidity, basic education, and chemotherapy for patients. The trajectories of patients and their partners were weakly correlated.\nA considerable minority of patients and partners had a persistently high level of depressive symptoms. Poorer relationship quality and previous antidepressant use most consistently characterized patients and partners with higher depressive symptom trajectories.\nIn clinical practice, attention to differences in depressive symptom trajectories is important to identify and target patients and partners who might need support.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb1","authors":["Nina Rottmann","Dorte Gils\u00e5 Hansen","Mari\u00ebt Hagedoorn","Pia Veldt Larsen","Anne Nicolaisen","Pernille Envold Bidstrup","Hanne W\u00fcrtzen","Henrik Flyger","Niels Kroman","Christoffer Johansen","Rottmann, Nina","Hansen, Dorte Gils\u00e5","Hagedoorn, Mari\u00ebt","Larsen, Pia Veldt","Nicolaisen, Anne","Bidstrup, Pernille Envold","W\u00fcrtzen, Hanne","Flyger, Henrik","Kroman, Niels","Johansen, Christoffer"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11764-016-0538-3","endpage":"926","first_seen_on":"2016-04-16T02:03:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-2267","1932-2259"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Cancer Survivorship","last_mentioned_on":1461399600,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11764-016-0538-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27084710?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27084710\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11764-016-0538-3.pdf","pmid":"27084710","pubdate":"2016-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"915","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Depressive symptom trajectories in women affected by breast cancer and their male partners: a nationwide prospective cohort study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11764-016-0538-3","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depressive-symptom-trajectories-women-affected-breast-cancer-male-partners-nationwide-prospective-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3281144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4224948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245117,"mean":11.796054129473,"rank":103475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":138057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245117,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":7.7902111111111,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.6722222222222,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
