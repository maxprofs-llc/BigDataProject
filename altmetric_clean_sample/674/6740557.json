In the context of a general reappraisal of iodinated Pt(ii) derivatives, aiming at a more systematic evaluation of their chemical and biological profiles, here we report on the reactivity of cis-PtI2(NH3)2 with selected DNA model systems, in single, double strand or G-quadruplex form, using cisplatin as a control. A combined approach has been exploited in this study, including circular dichroism (CD), UV-visible spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses. The data reveal that cis-PtI2(NH3)2 shows an overall reactivity towards the investigated oligonucleotides significantly higher than cisplatin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Domenica Musumeci","Chiara Platella","Claudia Riccardi","Antonello Merlino","Tiziano Marzo","Lara Massai","Luigi Messori","Daniela Montesarchio"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt00294c","endpage":"8600","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T13:54:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"20","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1460726350,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT00294C?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt00294c","pmid":"27126508","pubdate":"2016-04-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"8587","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              A first-in-class and a fished out anticancer platinum compound: cis-[PtCl\n              2\n              (NH\n              3\n              )\n              2\n              ] and cis-[PtI\n              2\n              (NH\n              3\n              )\n              2\n              ] compared in their reactivity towards DNA model systems\n            ","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/firstinclass-fished-anticancer-platinum-compound-cisptcl-sub2sub-nh-sub3sub-sub2sub-cispti-sub2sub-n"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":6543378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268606,"mean":11.351109755961,"rank":226307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268606,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10730,"mean":0.67505061049492,"rank":2996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10730,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":468,"mean":0.8198886509636,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":468,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
