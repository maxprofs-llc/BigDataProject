We revised the experience of general surgeons who are used to manage chronic pleural purulent collections with video-assisted thoracoscopy.\nWith a similar technique, we successfully aspirated a parafalcine empyema using a flexible scope avoiding a more invasive craniotomy. A review of the treatment options of empyematous collections is also provided, focusing particularly on the hazardous parafalcine location.\nThe management of subdural empyemas poses different decision-making problems compared to common brain abscesses, urging a more rapid and holistic surgical treatment with minimally invasive approach. Endoscopic aspiration of parafalcine empyema was followed by complete recovery in our patient.\nFlexible endoscopy is a promising method to obtain complete pus removal even from loculated collections through a bur hole, avoiding large craniotomies and consequent potential complications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["Sammartino, Francesco","Feletti, Alberto","Fiorindi, Alessandro","Mazzucco, Grazia Marina","Longatti, Pierluigi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00381-016-3082-6","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T14:49:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-0350","0256-7040"],"journal":"Child's Nervous System","last_mentioned_on":1460730994,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27075188?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27075188","pubdate":"2016-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Aspiration of parafalcine empyemas with flexible scope","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aspiration-parafalcine-empyemas-flexible-scope"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":6543379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268606,"mean":11.351082578507,"rank":226311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268606,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":1.9325698198198,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":1.3140845070423,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
