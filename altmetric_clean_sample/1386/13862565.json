Previous studies of RTCs in Trinidad and Tobago were primarily concerned with patterns of drivers use of seat belts, road collisions as a cause of mortality in young men, and the economic burden of road collisions. Attempts were made to model road fatalities, but limited epidemiological data meant that it was difficult to determine trends or develop models. Methods This study determined the epidemiology of RTCs in Trinidad and Tobago over the period 2000-2011using data collected by the Trinidad and Tobago Road Traffic Branch of the Police Service and secondary data from the Central Statistical Office. Data were analyzed using Excel, SPSS, and R statistical packages. Results Fatalities were greater among men (80%) than among women (20%) and were highest on two major freeways in Trinidad [the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway and the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway]. Most collisions occurred during the night among individuals between the ages of 15 and 44 years. Fatalities among drivers steadily increased over the study period and overtook fatalities among pedestrians, who were the group most affected in 2000. Most fatalities occurred at weekends. Conclusions These patterns can inform (i) education programs and (ii) road and traffic control measures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003ce2","authors":["Chavin D.
