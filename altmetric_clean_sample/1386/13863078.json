Portions of the cytochrome b gene or the control region were sequenced. The demographic history of each species was inferred using the Bayesian skyline method, mismatch distribution analysis and statistical neutrality tests. Demographic reconstruction analyses revealed a single pattern of variation in the effective population size (Ne ) among species. No dramatic changes in Ne were detected in upland species. By contrast, evidence of population expansion over the past 200\u2009000\u2009years was detected in all coastal plain and estuarine species. These findings correspond to periods of low sea-level (regressions) followed by a rapid increase in the sea-level by >100\u2009m. The resulting reconnections and subsequent fragmentation and isolation between the estuarine and freshwater bodies were putatively relevant to the historical demography of the fish species in these areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002da9","authors":["Tsch\u00e1, M.
