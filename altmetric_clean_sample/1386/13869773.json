In this study, we show that Netrin-4, a member of the axon guidance molecule family, was expressed in dorsal horn inner lamina II excitatory interneurons in the rat spinal cord. A similar expression pattern for Netrin-4 was also observed in human spinal cord. Behavioral analysis revealed that tactile and heat hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve injury or inflammation were abolished in Netrin-4-mutant rats. Transient suppression of Netrin-4 or its receptor Unc5B after injury could also prevent allodynia. Conversely, intrathecal administration of Netrin-4 protein to naive rats enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn and induced allodynia, suggesting that Netrin-4 is involved in spinal sensitization. Furthermore, the Unc5B receptor and subsequent activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 mediated Netrin-4-induced pain signaling in the spinal cord. These results identify Netrin-4 as a novel protein regulating spinal sensitization leading to chronic pain. Our findings provide evidence for the function of Netrin in the adult nervous system, as well as a previously unknown function in inducing pain signals from dorsal horn interneurons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Yasufumi Hayano","Keiko Takasu","Yoshihisa Koyama","Moe Yamada","Koichi Ogawa","Kazuhisa Minami","Toshiyuki Asaki","Kazuhiro Kitada","Satoshi Kuwabara","Toshihide Yamashita"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20160877","first_seen_on":"2016-11-21T20:32:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1540-9538"],"journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1481727764,"links":["http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/16\/jem.20160877.abstract","http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/16\/jem.20160877?papetoc","http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/16\/jem.20160877"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/jem\/early\/2016\/11\/16\/jem.20160877.full.pdf","pmid":"27856613","pubdate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"jem.20160877","subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Dorsal horn interneuron-derived Netrin-4 contributes to spinal sensitization in chronic pain via Unc5B","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dorsal-horn-interneuronderived-netrin4-contributes-spinal-sensitization-chronic-pain-via-unc5b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":4.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":1602698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6272108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253284,"mean":12.153900174903,"rank":72277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":180511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253284,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3748,"mean":6.7844974646384,"rank":828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3748,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":40.725830985915,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
