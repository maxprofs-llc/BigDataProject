Here a theoretical description of nematics, coupled to the relevant hydrodynamic equations, is presented here to explain the dynamics of active nematic shells. In extensile microtubule systems, the defects repel each other due to elasticity, and their collective motion leads to closed trajectories along the edges of a cube. That motion is accompanied by oscillations of their velocities, and the emergence and annihilation of vortices. When the activity increases, the system enters a chaotic regime. In contrast, for contractile systems, which are representative of some bacterial suspensions, a hitherto unknown static structure is predicted, where pairs of defects attract each other and flows arise spontaneously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Rui Zhang","Ye Zhou","Mohammad Rahimi","Juan J. de Pablo"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms13483","first_seen_on":"2016-11-21T20:39:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1480085336,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms13483"],"pmid":"27869130","pubdate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"13483","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Dynamic structure of active nematic shells","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-structure-active-nematic-shells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":3364810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4295937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248263,"mean":12.189850633604,"rank":107294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":136843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248263,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11909,"mean":43.043938696675,"rank":8967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2876,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11909,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":765,"mean":60.364921465969,"rank":625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":765,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
