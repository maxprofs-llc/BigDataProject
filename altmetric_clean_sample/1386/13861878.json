We hypothesized that authors of abstracts rejected by a meeting are less likely to pursue publication than those whose abstracts are accepted, regardless of research quality.\nBlinded review of abstracts submitted to a medical specialty meeting in 1991 and not published as full manuscripts within 5 years. In 1996, authors of 266 unpublished studies were asked to complete questionnaires.\nSubmission of a full manuscript to a journal between 1991 and 1996; failure to submit a manuscript to a journal because the investigator believed it would not be accepted for publication.\nA total of 223 (84%) of the unpublished investigators returned the questionnaire. Only 44 (20%) had submitted manuscripts to a journal. Manuscript submission was not associated with abstract quality (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-1.64), positive results (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.31-1.57), or other study characteristics. Having an abstract accepted for presentation at the meeting weakly predicted submission of a manuscript to a journal (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.84-4.10). Authors of accepted abstracts were significantly less likely to believe a journal would not publish their manuscript than were authors of rejected abstracts (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.0001-0.61).\nStudy characteristics do not predict attempts to publish research submitted to a scientific meeting. Investigators whose research is rejected by a meeting are pessimistic about chances for publication and may make less effort to publish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c38","authors":["Weber, E J","Callaham, M L","Wears, R L","Barton, C","Young, G"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-21T11:20:23+00:00","issns":["0098-7484"],"issue":"3","journal":"JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1479380400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9676674"],"pmid":"9676674","pubdate":"1998-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Unpublished research from a medical specialty meeting: why investigators fail to publish.","type":"article","volume":"280","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unpublished-research-medical-specialty-meeting-investigators-fail-publish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705958,"mean":6.6115526533506,"rank":1401937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6286351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705958,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246189,"mean":12.215805912554,"rank":63179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":180789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246189,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19001,"mean":35.000967684211,"rank":9821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":9148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19001,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":376,"mean":129.117936,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":376,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
