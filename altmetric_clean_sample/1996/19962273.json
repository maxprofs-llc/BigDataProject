The ribonuclease and RBP Regnase-1 exerts critical roles in both immune cells and non-immune cells. Its expression is rapidly induced under diverse conditions including microbial infections, treatment with inflammatory cytokines and chemical or mechanical stimulation. Regnase-1 activation is transient and is subject to negative feedback mechanisms including proteasome-mediated degradation or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) mediated cleavage. The major function of Regnase-1 is promoting mRNA decay via its ribonuclease activity by specifically targeting a subset of genes in different cell types. In monocytes, Regnase-1 downregulates IL-6 and IL-12B mRNAs, thus mitigating inflammation, whereas in T cells, it restricts T-cell activation by targeting c-Rel, Ox40 and Il-2 transcripts. In cancer cells, Regnase-1 promotes apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl2L1, Bcl2A1, RelB and Bcl3. Together with up-frameshift protein-1 (UPF1), Regnase-1 specifically cleaves mRNAs that are active during translation by recognizing a stem-loop (SL) structure within the 3'UTRs of these genes in endoplasmic reticulum-bound ribosomes. Through this mechanism, Regnase-1 rapidly shapes mRNA profiles and associated protein expression, restricts inflammation and maintains immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of Regnase-1 has been described in a multitude of pathological states including autoimmune diseases, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Here, we provide a comprehensive update on the function, regulation and molecular mechanisms of Regnase-1, and we propose that Regnase-1 may function as a master rapid response gene for cellular adaption triggered by microenvironmental changes.Cellular & Molecular Immunology advance online publication, 13 February 2017; doi:10.1038\/cmi.2016.70.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e24","authors":["Renfang Mao","Riyun Yang","Xia Chen","Edward W Harhaj","Xiaoying Wang","Yihui Fan"],"doi":"10.1038\/cmi.2016.70","endpage":"422","first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T19:18:30+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1672-7681","2042-0226"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1494271096,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cmi\/journal\/v14\/n5\/full\/cmi201670a.html"],"pmid":"28194024","pubdate":"2017-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"412","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Regnase-1, a rapid response ribonuclease regulating inflammation and stress responses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regnase1-rapid-response-ribonuclease-regulating-inflammation-stress-responses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":7072732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237497,"mean":12.426464369926,"rank":193080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237497,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":5.9003836930456,"rank":365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.1909090909091,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
