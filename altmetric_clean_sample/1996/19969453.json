Compression of a peripheral nerve can disturb the intraneural transport (axonal transport) of a large variety of substances. This may be followed by morphological and biochemical changes in the nerve cell body. These central changes may effect the axon as a whole and confer on the nerve an increased susceptibility to trauma. Studies concerning the reaction of neurones to compression, relevant when discussing the double crush syndrome, are reviewed.","authors":["Dahlin, L B","Lundborg, G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-09T04:24:30+00:00","issns":["0266-7681"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of hand surgery (Edinburgh, Scotland)","last_mentioned_on":1490921164,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2407794"],"pmid":"2407794","pubdate":"1990-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The neurone and its response to peripheral nerve compression.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurone-response-peripheral-nerve-compression-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
