In a multicenter retrospective study we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) for gastric SMT resection. Patients and methods\u2002Between October 2007 and December 2011, 126 patients with gastric SMTs underwent LECS at 8 institutions. Patient demographics, tumor histopathologic characteristics, and operative and follow-up data were reviewed. Results\u200216 tumors (12.7\u200a%) were located in the upper third of the stomach, 88 (69.8\u200a%) in the middle third, 5 (4.0\u200a%) in the lower third, and 17 (13.5\u200a%) at the esophagogastric junction. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) operation time for LECS was 190.2 (66.8) min, with a mean estimated blood loss of 15.1 (38.6) mL. In 2 cases (1.6\u200a%), the procedure was converted to open surgery because of intra-abdominal adhesions or stenosis. Morbidity was found in 6 cases (4.8\u200a%), including 2 leakage, 2 gastric stasis, 1 fever, and 1 cystitis. Histologically, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was found in 86 (68.3\u200a%) cases. The median follow-up period was 54.7 months; no local or distant tumor recurrence was observed and all patients were alive. Conclusions\u2002LECS proved to be a safe and feasible procedure for the resection of gastric SMTs, with a reasonable operation time, low bleeding, and an acceptable complication rate in this multicenter study in Japan.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027c5","authors":["Tatsuo Matsuda","Souya Nunobe","Toshiyuki Kosuga","Hiroshi Kawahira","Noriyuki Inaki","Shuji Kitashiro","Nobutsugu Abe","Isao Miyashiro","Sayaka Nagao","Masahiko Nishizaki","Naoki Hiki"," null","Tatsuo Matsuda","Souya Nunobe","Toshiyuki Kosuga","Hiroshi Kawahira","Noriyuki Inaki","Shuji Kitashiro","Nobutsugu Abe","Isao Miyashiro","Sayaka Nagao","Masahiko Nishizaki","Naoki Hiki"," null"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0043-104526","first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T22:56:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0013-726X","1438-8812"],"journal":"Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1494251400,"links":["https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0043-104526"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/pdf\/10.1055\/s-0043-104526.pdf","pmid":"28395384","pubdate":"2017-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Laparoscopic and luminal endoscopic cooperative surgery can be a standard treatment for submucosal tumors of the stomach: a retrospective multicenter study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopic-luminal-endoscopic-cooperative-surgery-standard-treatment-submucosal-tumors-stomach-ret"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":7072715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237492,"mean":12.426729779234,"rank":193078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237492,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1272,"mean":2.0421809598741,"rank":768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1272,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0571428571429,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":2}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=2270405029850780&id=1704082076483081","license":"public","citation_ids":[19965383],"posted_on":"2017-05-08T13:50:00+00:00","summary":"From this month\u2019s issue:\n\n\u201cLaparoscopic and luminal endoscopic cooperative surgery can be a standard treatment for submucosal tumors of the stomach: a retrospective multicenter study\u201d by Matsuda et al.\n\nFig. 3 Laparoscopic and (luminal) endoscopic cooperat","author":{"name":"Endoscopy","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1704082076483081","facebook_wall_name":"Endoscopy","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1704082076483081\/picture","id_on_source":"1704082076483081"}}]}}
