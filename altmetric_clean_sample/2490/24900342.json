Recently, the role of genetic factors in the etiology of MCs has been evaluated. However, studies with a larger patient subset are lacking, and candidate genes involved in other disc degeneration phenotypes have not been evaluated. We studied the prevalence of MCs and genetic association of 41 candidate genes in a large Indian cohort.\nMCs are vertebral endplate signal changes predominantly observed in the lumbar spine. A significant association between MCs and lumbar disc degeneration and nonspecific low back pain has been described, with the etiopathogenesis implicating various mechanical, infective, and biochemical factors.\nWe studied 809 patients using 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging to determine the prevalence, patterns, distribution, and type of lumbar MCs. Genetic association analysis of 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 41 candidate genes was performed based on the presence or absence of MCs. SNPs were genotyped using the Sequenome platform, and an association test was performed using PLINK software.\nThe mean age of the study population (n=809) was 36.7\u00b110.8 years. Based on the presence of MCs, the cohort was divided into 702 controls and 107 cases (prevalence, 13%). MCs were more commonly present in the lower (149\/251, 59.4%) than in the upper (102\/251, 40.6%) endplates. L4-5 endplates were the most commonly affected levels (30.7%). Type 2 MCs were the most commonly observed pattern (n=206, 82%). The rs2228570 SNP of VDR (p=0.02) and rs17099008 SNP of MMP20 (p=0.03) were significantly associated with MCs.\nGenetic polymorphisms of SNPs of VDR and MMP20 were significantly associated with MCs. Understanding the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of MCs is important for planning preventive and therapeutic strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbd4","authors":["Rishi Mugesh Kanna","Rajasekaran Shanmuganathan","Veera Ranjani Rajagopalan","Senthil Natesan","Raveendran Muthuraja","Kenneth Man Chee Cheung","Danny Chan","Patrick Yu Ping Kao","Anita Yee","Ajoy Prasad Shetty"],"doi":"10.4184\/asj.2017.11.4.594","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T11:10:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1976-1902","1976-7846"],"issue":"4","journal":"Asian Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1504782634,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28874978?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5573854","pmid":"28874978","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Prevalence, Patterns, and Genetic Association Analysis of Modic Vertebral Endplate Changes","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-patterns-genetic-association-analysis-modic-vertebral-endplate-changes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":7244430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123096,"mean":12.094432576465,"rank":100062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123096,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.4918103448276,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
