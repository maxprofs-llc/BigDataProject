Little is known, however, about tiger abundance, which is a flagship species for tropical evergreen forests. Our objective was to document the capture rate and population density of tigers based on spatial explicit capture-recapture (SECR) approaches using camera trap data in an intensive study area (ISA) of 158\u00a0km(2) in Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) during March to May 2006. The Reserve lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalayan Mountains, northeast India. We monitored 38 camera traps in ISA for 70\u00a0days and documented 10 photo-captures of tigers (5 left and 5 right flanks) with an average trap success rate of 1.3 captures\/100 trap days. The overall capture probability was 0.05. The tiger density estimated using a SECR model was 0.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.23 individuals\/100\u00a0km(2). This is the first systematic sampling study in tropical semi evergreen forests of India, and information on capture rate and population density of tigers provides baseline data from which to determining changes in the future to assist conservation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","doi":"10.1186\/2193-1801-3-462","first_seen_on":"2014-08-24T02:41:55+00:00","issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1408848067,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/3\/1\/462\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/pdf\/2193-1801-3-462.pdf","pmid":"25187884","pubdate":"2014-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","startpage":"462","title":"Tiger density in a tropical lowland forest in the Eastern Himalayan Mountains","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tiger-density-tropical-lowland-forest-eastern-himalayan-mountains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114321,"mean":8.1438642232334,"rank":74564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114321,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":970,"mean":2.3117626418989,"rank":583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":970,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":2.6930927835052,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/7Journals\/status\/503371395632345088","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2621667],"posted_on":"2014-08-24T02:41:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cyborg \ud83d\udc32","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848673691294720001\/kTRgLXxx_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"7Journals","tweeter_id":"58580755","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":1068},"tweet_id":"503371395632345088"}]}}
