The cascade effects one C-C and two C-N bond-forming events in one reaction vessel under operationally simple, additive-free reaction conditions in good to excellent yields. The methodology was further extended to the synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinoline scaffolds common to several biologically active natural products in a two-step sequence with remarkable selectivity (up to 94%\u2005ee).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Bisai, Vishnumaya","Suneja, Arun","Singh, Vinod K."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201405074","endpage":"10741","first_seen_on":"2014-08-25T07:16:20+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"40","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
