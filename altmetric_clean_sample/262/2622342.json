A mail survey was conducted among a random sample of men and women aged between 38 and 79 years; 1105 usable questionnaires were obtained. Structural equation modelling was used to examine relationships between the variables. The results showed that there were distinct relationships between predictive variables and behavioural and BMI outcomes for men and women. For example, healthy eating, eating out behaviours were positively associated with body weight for women but not men while attention to weight and health habits was positively related to hedonism values for women but not for men. The interrelationships among the predictors and the outcome variables appear to be more complex for women than men. The implications of the findings for nutrition communication are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2012.01.008","first_seen_on":"2014-08-24T19:59:57+00:00","issns":["01956663"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1408912981,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195666312000098"],"pmid":"22265754","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Similar but different.
