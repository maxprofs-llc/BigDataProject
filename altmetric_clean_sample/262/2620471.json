[Elife. 2014] - PubMed - NCBI"],"citation":{"abstract":"Cell-based studies showed that several Mdm2-binding ribosomal proteins, upon overexpression, stabilize and activate p53. In contrast, here we show in a mouse knockout study that Mdm2-binding ribosomal protein S27-like (Rps27l), upon disruption, activates p53. Germline inactivation of Rps27l triggers ribosomal stress to stabilize Mdm2, which degrades Mdm4 to reduce Mdm2-Mdm4 E3 ligase towards p53, leading to p53-dependent apoptotic depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and postnatal death, which is rescued by Trp53 deletion. Paradoxically, while increased p53 is expected to inhibit tumorigenesis, Rps27l(-\/-);Trp53(+\/-) mice develop lymphomas at higher incidence with p53 loss-of-heterozygosity and severe genome aneuploidy, suggesting that Rps27l disruption impose a selection pressure against p53. Thus, Rps27l has dual functions in p53 regulation: under Trp53(+\/+) background, Rps27l disruption triggers ribosomal stress to induce p53 and apoptosis, whereas under Trp53(+\/-) background, Rps27l disruption triggers genomic instability and Trp53 deletion to promote tumorigenesis. Our study provides a new paradigm of p53 regulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Xiufang Xiong","Yongchao Zhao","Fei Tang","Dongping Wei","Daffyd Thomas","Xiang Wang","Yang Liu","Pan Zheng","Yi Sun","Xiong X","Zhao Y","Tang F","Wei D","Thomas D","Wang X","Liu Y","Zheng P","Sun Y"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.02236","first_seen_on":"2014-08-23T07:10:57+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["2050-084X",""],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1409788800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25144937","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.02236"],"pmid":"25144937","pubdate":"2014-08-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications Limited","title":"Ribosomal protein S27-like is a physiological regulator of p53 that suppresses genomic instability and tumorigenesis","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ribosomal-protein-s27like-physiological-regulator-p53-suppresses-genomic-instability-tumorigenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836362,"mean":5.7718181632858,"rank":2229726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2484342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836362,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123131,"mean":8.4661908876798,"rank":51512,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":67442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123131,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2012,"mean":23.556963699652,"rank":1594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2012,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":31.279318681319,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
