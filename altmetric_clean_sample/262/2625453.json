A rational way to overcome this problem is to use the topology of bio-molecular interaction networks in order to constrain the solution space. Such approaches systematically integrate the existing biological knowledge with the 'omics' data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007db","authors":["Ana Paula Oliveira","Kiran Raosaheb Patil","Jens Nielsen"],"doi":"10.1186\/1752-0509-2-17","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T01:29:25+00:00","issns":["","1752-0509"],"journal":"BMC Systems Biology","last_mentioned_on":1409005560,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1752-0509-2-17"],"pmcid":"PMC2268660","pmid":"18261202","pubdate":"2008-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiological, Cellular and Medical Topics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Simulation and Modeling","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Systems Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Architecture of transcriptional regulatory circuits is knitted over the topology of bio-molecular interaction networks.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/architecture-transcriptional-regulatory-circuits-knitted-topology-biomolecular-interaction-networks-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4176551,"mean":5.1202443137874,"rank":714828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3444025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4176551,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108039,"mean":8.1902349543679,"rank":22428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":85286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108039,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":2.7282135007849,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.1229230769231,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
