Herein, we demonstrate the controlled clustering of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) ranging from discretely encapsulated SPIOs to giant clusters, containing hundreds or even more particles, using an amphiphilic polyisoprene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PI-b-PEG) diblock copolymer. Within these clusters, the SPIOs interact with each other and show new collective properties neither obtainable with singly encapsulated nor with the bulk material. We observed cluster size-dependent magnetic properties, influencing the blocking temperature, the magnetoviscosity of the liquid suspension, and the r2 relaxivity for magnetic iron oxides (FeOX) NPs. The clustering-methodology can be expanded also to other nanoparticle materials (CdSe\/CdS\/ZnS core\/shell\/shell quantum dots (QDs), CdSe\/CdS quantum-dots\/quantum-rods (QDQRs), gold nanoparticles, and mixtures thereof).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Christian Schmidtke","Robin Eggers","Robert Zierold","Artur Feld","Hauke Kloust","Christopher Wolter","Johannes Ostermann","Jan-Philip Merkl","Theo Schotten","Kornelius Nielsch","Horst Weller"],"doi":"10.1021\/la5021934","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T11:28:34+00:00","issns":["1520-5827"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1432377786,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25152249?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25152249?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25152249","pubdate":"2014-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Polymer-Assisted Self-Assembly of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles into Well-Defined Clusters: Controlling the Collective-Magnetic Properties.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymerassisted-selfassembly-superparamagnetic-iron-oxide-nanoparticles-welldefined-clusters-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5133392,"mean":6.0721661767058,"rank":3390216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1528510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5133392,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134150,"mean":8.4339954080911,"rank":83544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":44454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134150,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2056,"mean":2.8267143552311,"rank":1056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2056,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":2.583875,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
