The cyclic porphyrin trimer, the smallest directly linked cyclic porphyrin wheel to date, and its twined pentamer, exhibit small electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gaps, broad nonsplit Soret bands, and red-shifted Q-bands, thus indicating large electronic interactions between the constituent porphyrin units.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Cai, Hao","Fujimoto, Keisuke","Lim, Jong Min","Wang, Chaojie","Huang, Weiming","Rao, Yutao","Zhang, Senmiao","Shi, Hui","Yin, Bangshao","Chen, Bo","Ma, Ming","Song, Jianxin","Kim, Dongho","Osuka, Atsuhiro"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201407032","endpage":"11091","first_seen_on":"2014-08-25T14:05:03+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"41","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
