Because these disorders have been associated with unsafe gait characterized by an increase in stride-to-stride variability of stride time (STV), we hypothesised that SRBDs could be associated with an increased STV. The aim of this study was to examine the association between SRBDs and STV in French healthy older community-dwellers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d9","authors":["S\u00e9bastien Celle","C\u00e9dric Annweiler","Richard Camicioli","Jean-Claude Barth\u00e9lemy","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Roche","Olivier Beauchet"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2466-14-140","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T12:10:47+00:00","issns":["1471-2466"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pulmonary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1409703249,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25150985?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25150985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25150985","pubdate":"2014-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Sleep-related breathing disorders and gait variability: a cross-sectional preliminary study.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleeprelated-breathing-disorders-gait-variability-crosssectional-preliminary-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":1983900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2422093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114631,"mean":8.0559212248104,"rank":45180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":66386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114631,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":2.909429280397,"rank":173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.1295,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
