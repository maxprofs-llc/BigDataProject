A major recent focus in the literature has been on masculinity and meat eating, with research showing that meat is strongly associated with masculinity, and that individuals who follow a meat-based diet are perceived as more masculine than are individuals who follow a vegetarian diet. Although direct evidence for impression management through food intake remains sparse, a number of methodological approaches (including priming techniques and ecological valid assessments) are described that could be used in future research to identify the motives underlying people's eating behavior. Consumption stereotypes and impression management may be important influences on people's eating behavior, but the complexities of how, when, and for whom these factors influence food intake are still not well understood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","authors":["Vartanian LR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2014.08.021","endpage":"80","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T06:03:08+00:00","issns":["01956663","0195-6663"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1469597220,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195666314004188","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25149198","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.appet.2014.08.021"],"pmid":"25149198","pubdate":"2014-08-18T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["behavioralsciences","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Impression management and food intake: current directions in research.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impression-management-food-intake-current-directions-research-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":1444283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6689243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186441,"mean":7.7454335550313,"rank":34779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":151527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186441,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2338,"mean":16.532789901583,"rank":957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2338,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":27.387875,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
