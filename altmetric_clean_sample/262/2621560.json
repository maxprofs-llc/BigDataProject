He had been treated by an internist after being found to have hiv; as a result of non-compliance over a period of about four months his cd4-count had dropped to 40. Six months earlier he had developed a cryptococcal meningitis, which left him a number of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. During his stay in hospital there had to be good collaboration with the specialist in internal medicine whose dual task was to manage the patient's dramatically low cd4-account as well as his psychosis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders and mortality in hiv-infected persons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b8a","authors":["Michielsen PJ","Arts MH"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-24T00:24:50+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie","last_mentioned_on":1408839840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25132596?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25132596","pubdate":"2014-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"[Cryptococcal meningitis and neuropsychiatric consequences of HIV-infection].","type":"article","volume":"56"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4171124,"mean":5.1254261624192,"rank":3336659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":107725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4171124,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107641,"mean":8.1232344481606,"rank":85864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107641,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":1.1201604938272,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.55,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ConcordeMedica\/status\/503336888531701760","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2621560],"posted_on":"2014-08-24T00:24:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.dralexconcorde.info\/#!health-and-medicine\/c224f","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1248165228\/concorde_medica_cropped__normal.jpg","description":"Dr Alex is creator of a unique 21C Individual Medicine called 'CruX'!
