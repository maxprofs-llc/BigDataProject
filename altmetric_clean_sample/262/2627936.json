An electronic literature research of published studies concerning LRYGB and LSG was performed from inception to October 2013. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), resolution or improvement rate of comorbidities, and adverse events were all pooled and compared by the software Review Manager 5.1. As a result, a total of 21 studies involving 18,766 morbidly obese patients were eventually selected according to the inclusion criteria. No significant difference was found in %EWL during 0.5- to 1.5-year follow-up (P\u2009>\u20090.05), but after that, LRYGB achieved higher %EWL than LSG (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Except for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), the difference between these two procedures in the resolution or improvement rate of other comorbidities did not reach a statistical significance (P\u2009>\u20090.05). There were more adverse events in LRYGB compared with LSG (P\u2009<\u20090.01). In conclusion, LRYGB is superior to LSG in efficacy but inferior to LSG in safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Zhang Y","Ju W","Sun X","Cao Z","Xinsheng X","Daquan L","Xiangyang X","Qin M","Yong Zhang","Wang Ju","Xiangyu Sun","Zhanguo Cao","Xu Xinsheng","Liu Daquan","Xin Xiangyang","Mingfang Qin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-014-1385-9","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T15:57:08+00:00","issns":["1708-0428","0960-8923"],"issue":"","journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1419659885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25092167","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11695-014-1385-9","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11695-014-1385-9?no-access=true"],"pmid":"25092167","pubdate":"2014-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Versus Laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass for Morbid Obesity and Related Comorbidities: A Meta-Analysis of 21 Studies","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy-versus-laparoscopic-rouxeny-gastric-bypass-morbid-obesity-related-co-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":1700310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2976109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116561,"mean":8.3987170384352,"rank":35136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116561,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1270,"mean":2.2371804570528,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1270,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.9404255319149,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
