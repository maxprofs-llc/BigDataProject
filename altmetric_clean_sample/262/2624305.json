Methods: We compared the clinical characteristics and PSL treatment between 226 patients who achieved minimal manifestations (MM) or better and 246 patients who remained improved (I) or worse according to MG Foundation of America postintervention status. Results: Achievement of MM or better at peak PSL dose (odds ratio 12.25, P<0.0001) and combined use of plasma exchange (PE)\/plasmapheresis (PP) and\/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (odds ratio 1.92, P=0.04) were associated positively, and total PSL dose during the past year (odds ratio 0.17, P=0.03) was associated negatively with present MM or better status. Discussion: Higher PSL dose and longer PSL treatment do not ensure better outcome. In the absence of a good response, the PSL dose should be decreased by combining with modalities such as PE\/PP or IVIg. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008208","authors":["Imai, Tomihiro","Suzuki, Shigeaki","Tsuda, Emiko","Nagane, Yuriko","Murai, Hiroyuki","Masuda, Masayuki","Konno, Shingo","Suzuki, Yasushi","Nakane, Shunya","Fujihara, Kazuo","Suzuki, Norihiro","Utsugisawa, Kimiaki"],"doi":"10.1002\/mus.24438","endpage":"696","first_seen_on":"2014-08-25T17:02:54+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4598","0148-639X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Muscle & Nerve","last_mentioned_on":1409146810,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.24438\/abstract?campaign=wolacceptedarticle","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.24438\/abstract;jsessionid=DD6C7741D47F9FA1F3C57EBBDD5EF7AF.f04t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.24438\/abstract;jsessionid=B8B34C42907C92CBD4F9C1DE262CC9B4.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.24438\/pdf","pmid":"25155615","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"692","subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Oral corticosteroid therapy and present disease status in myasthenia gravis","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oral-corticosteroid-therapy-present-disease-status-myasthenia-gravis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6395526,"mean":5.982299586664,"rank":2325492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4041993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6395526,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155331,"mean":8.1034950363744,"rank":54391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":99894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155331,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1012,"mean":3.0791849653808,"rank":355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1012,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.7294090909091,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
