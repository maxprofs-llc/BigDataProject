Fragments that inhibit LYP activity more potently in the presence of zinc, fragments that rescue LYP activity in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of zinc, and fragments that inhibit LYP activity independent of zinc concentration were identified. Of these, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene was the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 value of 2.52\u00b10.06\u03bcM after 2h of incubation. LYP inhibition by 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene was very similar to inhibition by 1,2-naphthoquinone (IC50=1.10\u00b10.03\u00b5M), indicating that the oxidized quinone species is likely the active inhibitor. The inhibition was time-dependent, consistent with covalent modification of the enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Thorson MK","Puerta DT","Cohen SM","Barrios AM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.06.016","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T03:44:28+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0960-894X"],"issue":"","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1408973460,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24997687"],"pmid":"24997687","pubdate":"2014-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibition of the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase: The effect of zinc(II) ions and chelating ligand fragments on enzymatic activity.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-lymphoid-tyrosine-phosphatase-effect-zincii-ions-chelating-ligand-fragments-enzymatic-act"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4176551,"mean":5.1202443137874,"rank":517176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3659466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4176551,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108039,"mean":8.1902372683686,"rank":17163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":90869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108039,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1481,"mean":2.0882013513514,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1481,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":0.82241379310345,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
