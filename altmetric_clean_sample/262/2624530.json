Conditions for attachment of the spin-label via esterification have been optimized on the direct synthesis of polyradicals from commercially available polyphenols and the carboxylic acid functionalized nitroxide TPC. A common synthetic protocol utilizing 4-hydroxy-4'-iodobiphenyl as a key building block has been used to synthesize an equilateral biradical and a triradical in only two steps from commercially available starting materials. The first synthesis of a tetraradical based upon an adamantane core bearing six equivalent nitroxide-nitroxide distances is also reported. These systems are very promising candidates for studying multi-spin effects in pulsed EPR distance measurements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Silvia Valera","Valera S","Taylor JE","Daniels DS","Dawson DM","Athukorala Arachchige KS","Ashbrook SE","Slawin AM","Bode BE","James E.
