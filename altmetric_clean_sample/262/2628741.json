We investigated the correlation of alpha v beta 3 (\u03b1v\u03b23), alpha v beta 5 (\u03b1v\u03b25) and alpha v beta 6 (\u03b1v\u03b26) integrin isoform expression with clinical characteristics including survival times in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). All BM from lung cancer operated at our institution between 1990 and 2011, were identified; where available, primary tumors were retrieved as well. Immunohistochemical analysis for \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25 and \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin subunits was performed and correlated with Ki67 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 indexes. Clinical data including survival data were obtained by chart review. 191 BM specimens of 191 patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer (172 non-small cell lung cancer and 19 small cell lung cancer) were included. In 18 patients matched primary tumor samples were available. \u03b1v\u03b26 expression was commonly found on BM tumor cells (103\/191; 53.9\u00a0%) and showed a significant association with low Ki67 proliferation indices (46 vs. 36\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, Mann-Whitney U test) and favorable survival times (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020; log rank test) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC BM. \u03b1v\u03b25 expression was highly expressed on vascular structures (167\/191; 87.4\u00a0%) and tumor stroma in BM (151\/191; 79.1\u00a0%) and associated with high HIF-1\u03b1 indices (60 vs. 90, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, Mann-Whitney U test). \u03b1v\u03b23 expression was more frequently found on vascular structures in BM than in primary tumors (68.1 vs. 5.6\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.645; Chi square test) and its expression in BM tumor cells correlated with low Ki67 indices (41 vs. 28\u00a0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046, Mann-Whitney U test). Expression of \u03b1v integrin subunits seem to be of pathobiological and clinical relevance in patients with NSCLC BM. Further investigations of their involvement in the brain metastatic cascade and their role as biomarkers are warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef4","authors":["Anna Sophie Berghoff","Astrid Kerstin Kovanda","Thomas Melchardt","Rupert Bartsch","Johannes A Hainfellner","Bence Sipos","Jens Schittenhelm","Christoph C Zielinski","Georg Widhalm","Karin Dieckmann","Michael Weller","Simon L Goodman","Peter Birner","Matthias Preusser"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10585-014-9675-0","first_seen_on":"2014-08-26T20:15:35+00:00","issns":["1573-7276"],"journal":"Clinical and Experimental Metastasis","last_mentioned_on":1409084059,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25150423?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25150423","pubdate":"2014-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"\u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25 and \u03b1v\u03b26 integrins in brain metastases of lung cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1v%CE%B23-%CE%B1v%CE%B25-%CE%B1v%CE%B26-integrins-brain-metastases-lung-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4181544,"mean":5.1196802441243,"rank":3338819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":114505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4181544,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108151,"mean":8.1942255016182,"rank":86223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108151,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":1.8520833333333,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.95555555555556,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
