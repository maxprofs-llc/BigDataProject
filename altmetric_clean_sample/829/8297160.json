Active surveillance in rural communities with an appropriat low-cost screening tool is required to facilitate early detection. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the population at risk of CCA in Bua Yai district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Northeastern Thailand using the Korat-CCA verbal screening test (KCVST) during June to October 2015. Reliability of KCVST demonstrated a Cronbach alpha coefficient=0.75 Stepwise-multiple regression showed that alcohol consumption was important for CCA screened, followed by agriculture and pesticide use, under-cooked cyprinoid fish consumption, praziquantel use, na\u00efve northeastern people, opisthorchiasis, family relatives with CCA, and cholangitis or cholecystitis or gallstones, respectively. Population at risk for CCA was classified to low risk (63.4%), moderate risk (33.7%), and high risk (1.32%) for CCA. When CCA was screened using ultrasonography, 4 of 32 high risk participants had an abnormal biliary tract with dilated bile ducts. This study indicates that KCVST is a potential useful too which decrease the cost of large scale CCA screening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b68","authors":["Kaewpitoon, Soraya J","Rujirakul, Ratana","Loyd, Ryan A","Panpimanmas, Sukij","Matrakool, Likit","Tongtawee, Taweesak","Kompor, Porntip","Norkaew, Jun","Chavengkun, Wasugree","Wakkhuwattapong, Parichart","Kujapun, Jirawoot","Ponphimai, Sukanya","Phatisena, Tanida","Eaksunti, Thawatchai","Polsripradist, Poowadol","Joosiri, Apinya","Sukkasam, Inchat","Padchasuwan, Natnapa","Kaewpitoon, Natthawut"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T01:09:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1513-7368"],"issue":"4","journal":"Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1464311349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27221919?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27221919","pubdate":"2016-05-27T22:03:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Surveillance of Populations at Risk of Cholangiocarcinoma Development in Rural Communities of Thailand Using the Korat-CCA Verbal Screening Test.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surveillance-populations-risk-cholangiocarcinoma-development-rural-communities-thailand-using-koratc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.455029471197,"rank":224277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1397,"mean":2.2907507163324,"rank":866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1397,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":0.45616438356164,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/par_papers\/statuses\/736001260948590593","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8297160],"posted_on":"2016-05-27T01:09:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Parasitology papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528615611803238400\/tFsCRNLw_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Parasitology papers in PubMed, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
