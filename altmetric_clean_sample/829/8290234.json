We think a modified method is easier\/more reliable- But don't take our word - try it!"],"citation":{"abstract":"To assess accuracy and repeatability of a modified echocardiographic approach to quantify superior vena cava (SVC) flow volume that uses a short-axis view to directly measure SVC area and a suprasternal view to measure flow velocity, both at the level of the right pulmonary artery.\nThree tertiary-level neonatal intensive care units.\nThis was a multicentre, prospective, observational study. Accuracy of the traditional and modified approach was first assessed by comparing echo measurements according to both techniques with Phase contrast MRI (PCMRI) assessments, in a cohort of 10 neonates. In a second cohort of 40 neonates, intraobserver scan-rescan repeatability and interobserver analysis-reanalysis repeatability were assessed by repeated SVC flow echo measurements, according to both techniques.\nThe traditional echocardiographic approach to assessment of SVC flow had a moderate agreement with PCMRI (r(2) 0.259), a scan-rescan intraobserver repeatability index (RI) of 37% (limits of agreement (LOA) -47\/+51\u2005mL\/kg\/min) and an interobserver analysis-reanalysis RI of 31% (LOA -38\/+40\u2005mL\/kg\/min). The modified approach showed a stronger agreement with PCMRI (r(2) 0.775), an improved intraobserver scan-rescan repeatability (RI 22%, LOA -24\/+18\u2005mL\/kg\/min) and improved interobserver analysis-reanalysis repeatability (RI 18%, LOA -18\/+20\u2005mL\/kg\/min).\nEchocardiographic assessment of SVC flow volume by tracing area from a short-axis view and measuring velocity-time integral from a suprasternal view offered an improvement in accuracy and repeatability, building on the traditional approach previously described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["Benjamim Ficial","Elena Bonafiglia","Ezio M Padovani","Maria A Prioli","Anna E Finnemore","David J Cox","Kathryn M Broadhouse","Anthony N Price","Giuliana Durighel","Alan M Groves"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2015-309523","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T18:00:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-2052"],"journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1464397932,"links":["http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/26\/archdischild-2015-309523.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/05\/26\/archdischild-2015-309523.full.pdf","pmid":"27231267","pubdate":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"fetalneonatal-2015-309523","subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"A modified echocardiographic approach improves reliability of superior vena caval flow quantification","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modified-echocardiographic-approach-improves-reliability-superior-vena-caval-flow-quantification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":3069690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4728183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269037,"mean":11.413817370166,"rank":93689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":174090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269037,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":890,"mean":5.383968503937,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":890,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.5909090909091,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IT":1,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"NO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeonatalEcho\/statuses\/735893195700178949","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8290234],"posted_on":"2016-05-26T17:59:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Neonatal Echo Skills","url":"http:\/\/neonatalechoskills.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2322534683\/Small_Banner_normal.jpg","description":"Helping professionals build their neonatal echo knowledge and skills.
