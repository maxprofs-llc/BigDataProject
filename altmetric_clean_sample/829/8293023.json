A key regulator of translation that controls ribosome recruitment flux is eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F, a hetero-trimeric complex composed of the cap binding protein eIF4E, the scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A. Small molecule inhibitors targeting eIF4F display promising anti-neoplastic activity in preclinical settings. Among these are some rocaglate family members that are well tolerated in\u00a0vivo, deplete eIF4F of its eIF4A helicase subunit, have shown activity as single agents in several xenograft models, and can reverse acquired resistance to MAPK and PI3K-mTOR targeted therapies. Herein, we highlight the power of using genetic complementation approaches and CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated editing for drug-target validation ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vivo, linking the anti-tumor properties of rocaglates to eIF4A inhibition.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Jennifer Chu","Gabriela Galicia-V\u00e1zquez","Regina Cencic","John\u00a0R.
