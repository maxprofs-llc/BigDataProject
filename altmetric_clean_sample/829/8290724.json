However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the function(s) of TSPO in glial cells. Here, we identify a novel function of TSPO in microglia that is not associated with steroidogenesis. We propose that a TSPO interaction with NADPH oxidase (NOX2) links the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the induction of an antioxidant response to maintain redox homeostasis. This line of investigation may provide a greater understanding of TSPO glial cell biology, and the knowledge gained may prove beneficial in devising therapeutic strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b4","authors":["Tom\u00e1s R.
