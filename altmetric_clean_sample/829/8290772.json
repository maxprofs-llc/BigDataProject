Molecular weight (MW) is a key parameter in design, and incorporation of fluorine is associated with a disproportionate increase in MW considering the van der Waals radius of fluorine versus hydrogen. Herein we examine a large compound data set to understand the effect of introducing fluorine on the risk of encountering P-glycoprotein mediated efflux (as measured by MDR efflux ratio), passive permeability, lipophilicity, and metabolic stability. Statistical modeling of the MDR ER data demonstrated that an increase in MW as a result of introducing fluorine atoms does not lead to higher risk of P-gp mediated efflux. Fluorine-corrected molecular weight (MWFC), where the molecular weight of fluorine has been subtracted, was found to be a more relevant descriptor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Martin Pettersson"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b00027","endpage":"5296","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T18:45:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1472083200,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b00027","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b00027"],"pmid":"27228214","pubdate":"2016-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"5284","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Quantitative Assessment of the Impact of Fluorine Substitution on P-Glycoprotein (P-gp) Mediated Efflux, Permeability, Lipophilicity, and Metabolic Stability","type":"article","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-assessment-impact-fluorine-substitution-pglycoprotein-pgp-mediated-efflux-permeability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":3579981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4574104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272629,"mean":11.584112974456,"rank":108519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":159358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272629,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4036,"mean":4.1934250309789,"rank":2393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4036,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":5.4729485714286,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
