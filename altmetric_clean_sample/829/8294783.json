We therefore analyze the impact of 24\u2009h BPV on the development of future cardiovascular disease determined by The Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations 10-year risk calculator.\nWe analyzed 250 adult patients, ages 40-80 years old. The ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was recorded automatically. We defined the mean blood pressure values, SD, and coefficient of variation (CV) of blood pressure on the basis of the recorded 24\u2009h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring values as an indicator for BPV.Patients were divided into two groups according to their Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations 10-year risk profile (<7.5 and \u22657.5%).\nBesides the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), parameters showing the BPV such as SD and CV of mean blood pressures were also significantly higher in patients with an elevated 10-year risk score compared with others. Only CV of SBP and pulse pressure showed a clear association with the 10-year risk in multivariate logistic regression analysis. The results suggested that each 1% increase in CV of SBP could lead to a 1.258-fold increase in The Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations 10-year risk score.\nIn the present study, we found that independent of baseline SBP, increased CV of SBP within 24\u2009h was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, as assessed by The Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations 10-year risk calculator.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005780","authors":["Celik, Murat","Yuksel, Uygar Cagdas","Yildirim, Erkan","Gursoy, Erol","Koklu, Mustafa","Yasar, Salim","Gormel, Suat","Gungor, Mutlu","Bugan, Baris","Barcin, Cem"],"doi":"10.1097\/mbp.0000000000000200","endpage":"287","first_seen_on":"2016-05-26T23:31:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1359-5237","1473-5725"],"issue":"5","journal":"Blood pressure monitoring.","last_mentioned_on":1474386645,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/The_relationship_between_blood_pressure.99607.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27228139?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/Abstract\/2016\/10000\/The_relationship_between_blood_pressure.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/The_relationship_between_blood_pressure.99607.pdf","pmid":"27228139","pubdate":"2016-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","title":"The relationship between blood pressure variability and Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations 10-year cardiovascular risk score","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_relationship_between_blood_pressure.99607.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-blood-pressure-variability-pooled-cohort-risk-assessment-equations-10year-cardi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":4245200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3947265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273665,"mean":11.620784524088,"rank":135666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":126987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273665,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":577,"mean":1.8928402777778,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":577,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4423076923077,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
