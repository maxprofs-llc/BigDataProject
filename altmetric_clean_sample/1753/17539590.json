While partial tendon ruptures can be treated non-operatively, complete ruptures are an indication for surgical treatment in order to restore strength and a full range of motion. Although many different methods have been published, there is no consensus on the optimal surgical technique.We report the case of a\u00a0patient who suffered from a\u00a0complete triceps rupture after a\u00a0fall. The injury was treated by open reduction and refixation of the tendon using the\u00a0double-row technique. The following article describes the technique and highlights its advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other procedures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c2a","authors":["M. Lange","M.
