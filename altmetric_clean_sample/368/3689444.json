Additionally, genetic variations and epigenetic changes of HCC cells could lead to aberrant signaling pathways, induce cancer stem cells and enhance tumor progression. Thus, the heterogeneity in HCC contributes to disease progression and a better understanding of its heterogeneity will greatly aid in the development of strategies for the HCC treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002643","authors":["Kuo-Shyang Jeng","Chiung-Fang Chang","Wen-Juei Jeng","I-Shyan Sheen","Chi-Juei Jeng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.critrevonc.2015.01.009","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T00:08:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0461"],"journal":"Critical Reviews in Oncology\/Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1444307552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25680939?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25680939","pubdate":"2015-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma contributes to cancer progression.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/heterogeneity-hepatocellular-carcinoma-contributes-cancer-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6241899,"mean":5.954301804357,"rank":2933980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1862128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6241899,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168817,"mean":9.7314208605821,"rank":90736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":59867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168817,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":393,"mean":2.2389642857143,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":393,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.25,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
