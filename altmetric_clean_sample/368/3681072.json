Small gold particles, with a narrow particle size distribution around 1.7 nm, were obtained on 1,6-hexanedithiol-functionalized MWNTs. For MWNTs functionalized with the aminothiol, the average Au particle size was larger, 5.5 nm, apparently due to a coalescence phenomenon. Gatan image filter (GIF) observations show that sulfur is at the nanotube surface with a non-homogeneous distribution. A higher sulfur concentration was observed around the gold nanoparticles' location.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Rodolfo Zanella,*,\u2020"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp0521454","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T21:13:15+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1335432328,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp0521454","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16853071"],"pmid":"16853071","pubdate":"2006-07-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Deposition of gold nanoparticles onto thiol-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deposition-gold-nanoparticles-onto-thiolfunctionalized-multiwalled-carbon-nanotubes-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97600,"mean":8.1469345587559,"rank":25333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97600,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1934,"mean":1.496550439731,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1934,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.0079545454545,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
