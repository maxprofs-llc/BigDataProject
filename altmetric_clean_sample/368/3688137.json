However, past research has demonstrated substantial allelic association between STR markers on both autosomes and the X chromosome, leading to partially redundant information that these markers can provide. Here, we quantify the allelic association between Y-chromosomal STR markers that are part of established forensic panels, separately for three different continental groups. We further propose a sequential marker selection procedure that is based on Shannon's equivocation and that accounts for allelic association between STR markers, leading to a maximal gain in independent information. In application to three real-world data sets, we demonstrate the procedure's superior performance when compared to single-locus diversity selection strategies, resulting in the optimal marker set for a given data set in the majority of marker subsets. Noting the inferior performance of the established Y-STR marker panels in a retrospective investigation, we suggest that future forensic marker selection should be guided, besides by other technical selection criteria, by an equivocation-based approach to obtain maximally discriminatory marker sets at minimal cost.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e41","authors":["Sabine Siegert","Lutz Roewer","Michael Nothnagel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsigen.2015.02.001","endpage":"225","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:43:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18724973","1878-0326"],"journal":"Forensic Science International: Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1451567193,"links":["http:\/\/rss.sciencedirect.com\/action\/redirectFile?&zone=main&currentActivity=feed&usageType=outward&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS1872497315000307%26_version%3D1%26md5%3Df0a6e4e29b4fe44ec96434424c4144a4&fb_ref=Default&fb_source=message","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25682312?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25682312","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law And Legal Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"216","subjects":["jurisprudence","genetics"],"title":"Shannon's equivocation for forensic Y-STR marker selection.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shannons-equivocation-forensic-ystr-marker-selection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":2958849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3781366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243915,"mean":8.0489524012563,"rank":100663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":135470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243915,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":458,"mean":3.8675142231947,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":458,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.488962962963,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
