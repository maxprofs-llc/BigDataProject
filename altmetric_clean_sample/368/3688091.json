The cloning and characterization of two solanesyl diphosphate synthase genes, OsSPS1 and OsSPS2, in Oryza sativa is reported here. OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas OsSPS2 was found to be high in both leaves and roots. Enzymatic characterization using recombinant proteins showed that both OsSPS1 and OsSPS2 could produce solanesyl diphosphates as their final product, while OsSPS1 showed stronger activity than OsSPS2. However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas OsSPS2 only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant. HPLC analyses showed that both OsSPS1 and OsSPS2 yeast transformants produced UQ9 instead of UQ6, which is the native yeast UQ. According to the complementation study, the UQ9 levels in OsSPS2 transformants were much lower than that of OsSPS1. Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while OsSPS2 localized to plastids. This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas OsSPS2 is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation. These findings indicate that O. sativa has a different mechanism for the supply of isoprenoid precursors in UQ biosynthesis from Arabidopsis thaliana, in which SPS1 provides a prenyl moiety for UQ9 at the endoplasmic reticulum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","authors":["Kazuaki Ohara","Kanako Sasaki","Kazufumi Yazaki"],"doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/erq103","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:41:27+00:00","issns":["1460-2431"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1363637675,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/jxb\/erq103","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20421194"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/61\/10\/2683.full.pdf","pmid":"20421194","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Two solanesyl diphosphate synthases with different subcellular localizations and their respective physiological roles in Oryza sativa.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-solanesyl-diphosphate-synthases-different-subcellular-localizations-respective-physiological-rol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97766,"mean":8.1641480284358,"rank":25393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97766,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1450,"mean":2.4599917184265,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1450,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.330612244898,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
