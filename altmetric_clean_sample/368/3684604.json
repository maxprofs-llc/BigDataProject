Therefore, joint analysis of multiple phenotypes and multiple markers has been considered as an efficient strategy for genome-wide association analysis, and in this work we propose an omnibus family-based association test for the joint analysis of multiple genotypes and multiple phenotypes.\nThe proposed test can be applied for both quantitative and dichotomous phenotypes, and it is robust under the presence of population substructure, as long as large-scale genomic data is available. Using simulated data, we showed that our method is statistically more efficient than the existing methods, and the practical relevance is illustrated by application of the approach to obesity-related phenotypes.\nThe proposed method may be more statistically efficient than the existing methods. The application was developed in C++ and is available at the following URL: http:\/\/healthstat.snu.ac.kr\/software\/mfqls\/ .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Won, Sungho","Kim, Wonji","Lee, Sungyoung","Lee, Young","Sung, Joohon","Park, Taesung"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12859-015-0484-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T22:28:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1426285156,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/16\/46\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/16\/46"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12859-015-0484-5.pdf","pmid":"25887481","pubdate":"2015-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"46","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Family-based association analysis: a fast and efficient method of multivariate association analysis with multiple variants","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familybased-association-analysis-fast-efficient-method-multivariate-association-analysis-multiple-va-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4866695,"mean":5.796527301289,"rank":2242399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2501035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4866695,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184411,"mean":8.6776090450629,"rank":80285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":98203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184411,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2839,"mean":4.8935398167724,"rank":1723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2839,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":4.693952,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
