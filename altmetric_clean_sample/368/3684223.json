In this work, we examined whether the gametophytic generation of A. yokoscense also resists lead toxicity like the sporophytic generation. Spore germination in A. yokoscense was more tolerant to Pb2+, compared to that in other fern species, such as Pteridium aquilinum, Lygodium japonicum and Pteris vittata. In addition, the early gametophyte development of A. yokoscense was not much affected by 10 microM Pb2+, as evaluated from the prothallial growth and rhizoid development. We also showed that Athyrium gametophytes could accumulate more than 10,000 microg g(-1) of lead, and that the lead was localized in the cytosol and vacuole of rhizoidal cells, as determined by a transmission electron micrograph. These results indicate that Athyrium gametophytes have the ability to accumulate lead in the rhizoids. Furthermore, the gametophytes were found to include a large amount of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins). Because proanthocyanidins have a latent ability to complex with lead ions, the possible roles of proanthocyanidins in the lead tolerance and accumulation of Athyrium gametophytes are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ed2","authors":["Hiroyuki Kamachi","Ippei Komori","Hideo Tamura","Yoshimi Sawa","Ichirou Karahara","Yoshihiro Honma","Naoya Wada","Tokimasa Kawabata","Kenji Matsuda","Susumu Ikeno","Munenori Noguchi","Hiroshi Inoue"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10265-005-0202-x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T22:20:11+00:00","issns":["1618-0860"],"journal":"Journal of Plant Research","last_mentioned_on":1335814332,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/l732rhr31m3173n5\/fulltext.pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10265-005-0202-x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15843865"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10265-005-0202-x.pdf","pmid":"15843865","pubdate":"2005-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Lead tolerance and accumulation in the gametophytes of the fern Athyrium yokoscense.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lead-tolerance-accumulation-gametophytes-fern-athyrium-yokoscense"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4112741,"mean":5.1055355872457,"rank":957051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2593406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4112741,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139336,"mean":9.1115308285789,"rank":43137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":94268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139336,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":3.0852876712329,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.496875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
