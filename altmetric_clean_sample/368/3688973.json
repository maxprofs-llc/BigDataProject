In addition, picornaviruses such as enterovirus, coxsackievirus and rhinovirus also can cause life-threatening diseases. Replication of picornaviruses and coronaviruses requires 3Cpro (3C protease) and 3CLpro (3C-like protease) respectively, which are structurally analogous with chymotrypsin-fold, but the former is a monomer and the latter is dimeric due to an extra third domain for dimerization. Subtle structural differences in the S2 and S3 pockets of these proteases make inhibitors selective, but some dual inhibitors have been discovered. Our findings as summarized in the present review provide new potential anti-coronavirus and anti-picornavirus therapeutic agents and a clue to convert 3CLpro inhibitors into 3Cpro inhibitors and vice versa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c4","authors":["Ramajayam R","Tan KP","Liang PH"],"doi":"10.1042\/bst0391371","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T00:00:22+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemical Society Transactions","last_mentioned_on":1416988320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21936817"],"pmid":"21936817","pubdate":"2011-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Recent development of 3C and 3CL protease inhibitors for anti-coronavirus and anti-picornavirus drug discovery.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-development-3c-3cl-protease-inhibitors-anticoronavirus-antipicornavirus-drug-discovery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4553834,"mean":5.3241366058634,"rank":1052179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2933218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4553834,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141690,"mean":9.7427640960132,"rank":44265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":95763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141690,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":2.3909903614458,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.6875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
