This system comprises two 6 x 16.4 cm detectors that scan together covering up to a 24 x 16.4 cm field of view (FOV). There are no specific standards for testing this detector configuration. We performed several tests important to breast imaging, and we propose tests that should be included in standardized testing of PEM systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Lawrence MacDonald","John Edwards","Thomas Lewellen","David Haseley","James Rogers","Paul Kinahan"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.109.064345","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T20:55:34+00:00","issns":["2159-662X"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1325631064,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2967\/jnumed.109.064345","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19759118","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2873041"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jnm.snmjournals.org\/content\/50\/10\/1666.full.pdf","pmid":"19759118","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Clinical Imaging Characteristics of the Positron Emission Mammography Camera: PEM Flex Solo II","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-imaging-characteristics-positron-emission-mammography-camera-pem-flex-solo-ii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98244,"mean":8.187330720764,"rank":25634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98244,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1269,"mean":2.3720662460568,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1269,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.3192307692308,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Positron emission mammography","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=469410193#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3680211],"posted_on":"2012-01-03T22:51:04+00:00","summary":"Positron emission mammography is a modality used to detect breast cancer.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=32449035","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
