In the choice task, they responded either manually or vocally to the number of times a visual or auditory stimulus occurred; in the braking task, they depressed a brake pedal in response to the lead car's brake lights. The time delay between the onset of the tasks' stimuli, or stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), was varied. The tasks were differentially affected by the manipulations. Brake reaction times increased as SOA was reduced, showing the psychological refractory period effect, whereas the choice task showed large effects of the stimulus and response modalities but only a small effect of SOA. These results demonstrate that a well-practiced \"simple\" task such as vehicle braking is subject to dual-task slowing and extend the generality of the central-bottleneck model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Jonathan Levy","Harold Pashler","Erwin Boer"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-9280.2006.01690.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T21:12:31+00:00","issns":["1467-9280"],"journal":"Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1474320154,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1467-9280.2006.01690.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/17\/3\/228.full.pdf","pmid":"16507063","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Central Interference in Driving Is There Any Stopping the Psychological Refractory Period?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/central-interference-driving-stopping-psychological-refractory-period"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":4487489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256714,"mean":8.3998626403805,"rank":132230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":96473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256714,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3154,"mean":51.659231208373,"rank":2571,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3154,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":111.04632142857,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
