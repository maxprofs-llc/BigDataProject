Recently, an evidence assessment by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) of the oral antidiabetics of the glinide class showed that their long-term benefit is not proven. Accordingly, the responsible Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) decided to exclude glinides from prescription in the SHI system. This was, however, objected to by the Ministry of Health, which is charged with legal supervision. We use this case to illustrate the path from evidence assessments to coverage decisions in Germany against the background of the latest health reform, which has changed the legal requirements for evidence assessments and the ensuing coverage decisions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f67","authors":["Kreis J","Busse R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.healthpol.2011.11.006","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T00:11:16+00:00","issns":["0168-8510"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health Policy","last_mentioned_on":1385388084,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22136812","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.healthpol.2011.11.006"],"pmid":"22136812","pubdate":"2011-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"From evidence assessments to coverage decisions?
