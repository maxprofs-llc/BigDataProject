We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional methods to describe etiology of CAP in hospitalized adults and evaluated their respective diagnostic yields.\n267 CAP patients were enrolled consecutively over our 3-year prospective study. Conventional methods (i.e., bacterial cultures, urinary antigen assays, serology) were combined with nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and by real-time PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 12 types of respiratory viruses.\nEtiology was established in 167 (63%) patients with 69 (26%) patients having \u22651 copathogen. There were 75 (28%) pure bacterial and 41 (15%) pure viral infections, and 51 (19%) viral-bacterial coinfections, resulting in 126 (47%) patients with bacterial and 92 (34%) patients with viral etiology. S. pneumoniae (30%), influenza (15%) and rhinovirus (12%) were most commonly identified, typically with \u22651 copathogen. During winter and spring, viruses were detected more frequently (45%, P=.01) and usually in combination with bacteria (39%). PCR improved diagnostic yield by 8% in 64 cases with complete sampling (and by 15% in all patients); 5% for detection of bacteria; 19% for viruses (P=.04); and 16% for detection of \u22651 copathogen. Etiology was established in 79% of 43 antibiotic-naive patients with complete sampling. S. pneumoniae qPCR positive rate was significantly higher for OP swab compared to NP swab (P<.001). Positive rates for serology were significantly higher than for real-time PCR in detecting B. pertussis (P=.001) and influenza viruses (P<.001).\nEtiology could be established in 4 out of 5 CAP patients with the aid of PCR, particularly in diagnosing viral infections. S. pneumoniae and viruses were most frequently identified, usually with copathogens. Viral-bacterial coinfections were more common than pure infections during winter and spring; a finding we consider important in the proper management of CAP. When swabbing for qPCR detection of S. pneumoniae in adult CAP, OP appeared superior to NP, but this finding needs further confirmation.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01563315 .","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Holter, Jan C","M\u00fcller, Fredrik","Bj\u00f8rang, Ola","Samdal, Helvi H","Marthinsen, Jon B","Jenum, P\u00e5l A","Ueland, Thor","Fr\u00f8land, Stig S","Aukrust, P\u00e5l","Husebye, Einar","Heggelund, Lars"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-015-0803-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T22:33:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1429439014,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/15\/64\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25887603?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12879-015-0803-5.pdf","pmid":"25887603","pubdate":"2015-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"64","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia and diagnostic yields of microbiological methods: a 3-year prospective study in Norway.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/etiology-communityacquired-pneumonia-diagnostic-yields-microbiological-methods-3year-prospective-stu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5011922,"mean":5.9357357739708,"rank":2309792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2575186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5011922,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188886,"mean":8.7597548773065,"rank":82578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":100271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188886,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2655,"mean":3.156137905049,"rank":1163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":1364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2655,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":2.552014084507,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
