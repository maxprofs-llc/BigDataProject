O-GlcNAcases use a double-displacement mechanism involving formation and breakdown of a transient bicyclic oxazoline intermediate. The key catalytic residues of any family 84 enzyme facilitating this reaction, however, are unknown. Two mutants of human O-GlcNAcase, D174A and D175A, were generated since these residues are highly conserved among family 84 glycoside hydrolases. Structure-reactivity studies of the D174A mutant enzyme reveals severely impaired catalytic activity across a broad range of substrates alongside a pH-activity profile consistent with deletion of a key catalytic residue. The D175A mutant enzyme shows a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency with substrates bearing poor leaving groups (up to 3000-fold), while for substates bearing good leading groups the difference is much smaller (7-fold). This mutant enzyme also cleaves thioglycosides with essentially the same catalytic efficiency as the wild-type enzyme. As well, addition of azide as an exogenous nucleophile increases the activity of this enzyme toward a substrate bearing an excellent leaving group. Together, these results allow unambiguous assignment of Asp(174) as the residue that polarizes the 2-acetamido group for attack on the anomeric center and Asp(175) as the residue that functions as the general acid\/base catalyst. Therefore, the family 84 glycoside hydrolases use a DD catalytic pair to effect catalysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Naniye \u00c7etinba\u015f,\u2021"],"doi":"10.1021\/bi052370b","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:50:55+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1365876785,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/bi052370b","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16533067"],"pmid":"16533067","pubdate":"2006-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of Asp174 and Asp175 as the key catalytic residues of human O-GlcNAcase by functional analysis of site-directed mutants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-asp174-asp175-key-catalytic-residues-human-oglcnacase-functional-analysis-sitedirecte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":816043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98787,"mean":8.2157593586137,"rank":25843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98787,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5466,"mean":2.4659447392498,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5466,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.356914893617,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
