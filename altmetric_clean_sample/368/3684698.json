For sigma (sigma 1 and sigma 2 respectively) sites, PD 144418 affinities were determined using whole guinea pig brain membranes with [3H](+)-pentazocine and neuroblastoma x glioma cell membranes using [3H]1,3,di-O-tolylguanidine (DTG) in the presence of 200 nM (+)-pentazocine. PD 144418 exhibited an affinity for sigma 1 of 0.08 nM (Ki) versus a K1 of 1377 nM for sigma 2 site. Additional receptor binding studies indicated that PD 144418 lacked affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, muscarinic and a variety of other receptors. In vitro studies indicated that PD 144418 reversed the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced increase in cyclic GMP (cGMP) in rat cerebellar slices without affecting the basal levels, suggesting that sigma 1 sites may be important in the regulation of glutamine-induced actions. PD 144418 potentiated the decrease in 5-hydroxytryptophan caused by haloperidol in the mesolimbic region, but by itself had no effect in 5-hydroxytrypamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) synthesis. Behaviorally, similar to other sigma ligands, PD 144418 antagonized mescaline-induced scratching at doses that did not alter spontaneous motor activity. This action is suggestive of potential antipsychotic property. It exhibited no anxiolytic and antidepressant properties in the models used. These results show that PD 144418 is a very selective sigma 1 agent, devoid of any significant affinity for other receptors and that sigma 1 site may modulate actions in the CNS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["H C Akunne","S Z Whetzel","J N Wiley","A E Corbin","F W Ninteman","H Tecle","Y Pei","T A Pugsley","T G Heffner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T22:29:44+00:00","issns":["0028-3908"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1339732685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9144641"],"pmid":"9144641","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"The pharmacology of the novel and selective sigma ligand, PD 144418.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacology-novel-selective-sigma-ligand-pd-144418"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":817888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96936,"mean":8.063900964564,"rank":25035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96936,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1174,"mean":3.0647041773231,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1174,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.1071176470588,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
