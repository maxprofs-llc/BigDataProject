XY-214 by ammonium sulfate precipitation and successive chromatographies. The enzyme had a pl of 3.6 and a molecular mass of 52 kDa. The enzyme had the highest level of activity at pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C. The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by Cu2+, Hg2+, and N-bromosuccinimide. The enzyme hydrolyzed beta-1,3-xylan to produce mainly xylotriose and xylobiose but did not act on xylobiose, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, beta-1,4-xylan, beta-1,3-glucan, or carboxymethyl cellulose.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c94","authors":["T Araki","S Tani","K Maeda","S Hashikawa","H Nakagawa","T Morishita"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:50:02+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0916-8451"],"issue":"11","journal":"Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1365578969,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10635569"],"pmid":"10635569","pubdate":"1999-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Purification and characterization of beta-1,3-xylanase from a marine bacterium, Vibrio sp.
