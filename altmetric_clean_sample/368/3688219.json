Rituximab is the monoclonal antibody responsible for all clinical improvement noted to date. The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy (R-CHOP regimen) improves the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Adding rituximab to CHOP chemotherapy improves response rates and PFS in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Finally, the addition of rituximab to a variety of chemotherapy regimens improves the response rates, PFS, and OS in follicular lymphoma (FL). Several other (epratuzumab, bevacizumab, alemtuzumab) monoclonal antibody-chemotherapy combinations are currently under study in NHL. This review will summarize the data supporting the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy in NHL and discuss preliminary data regarding the use of other monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f6","doi":"10.1053\/j.seminhematol.2008.02.003","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:45:39+00:00","issns":["0037-1963"],"journal":"Seminars in Hematology (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1298222794,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1053\/j.seminhematol.2008.02.003","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18381103","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2919066"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.seminhematol.org\/article\/S0037196308000048\/pdf","pmid":"18381103","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Chemotherapy Combinations With Monoclonal Antibodies in Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemotherapy-combinations-monoclonal-antibodies-nonhodgkins-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":816228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97841,"mean":8.17056608749,"rank":25435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97841,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.0983870967742,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
