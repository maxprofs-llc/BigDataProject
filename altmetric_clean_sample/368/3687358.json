Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) contains monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, several of which are pharmaceutically important. Vinblastine and vincristine, for example, find widespread use as anti-cancer drugs. G10H is thought to play a key regulatory role in terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis. We purified G10H from C. roseus cells. Using degenerate PCR primers based on amino acid sequence information we cloned the corresponding cDNA. The encoded CYP76B6 protein has G10H activity when expressed in C. roseus and yeast cells. The stress hormone methyljasmonate strongly induced G10h gene expression coordinately with other terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis genes in a C. roseus cell culture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Collu, G","Unver, N","Peltenburg-Looman, A M","van der Heijden, R","Verpoorte, R","Memelink, J"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0014-5793(01)03045-9","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T23:25:09+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"2","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1359703700,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/s0014-5793(01)03045-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11718718"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579301030459\/pdf","pmid":"11718718","pubdate":"2001-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Geraniol 10-hydroxylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis.","type":"article","volume":"508","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geraniol-10hydroxylase-cytochrome-p450-enzyme-involved-terpenoid-indole-alkaloid-biosynthesis-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":817414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97292,"mean":8.1122351913333,"rank":25203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97292,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6224829009434,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.4727272727273,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
