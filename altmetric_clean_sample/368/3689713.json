The existence of bacterial homologues (40-50% identity with AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2) forming bi- or tri-functional proteins with a putative kinase belonging to the family of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases suggested that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 acted on phosphorylated and aminated compounds. Vertebrate genomes were found to encode a homologue (AGPHD1) of these putative bacterial kinases, which was therefore likely to phosphorylate an amino compound bearing a hydroxyl group. These and other considerations led us to hypothesize that AGPHD1 corresponded to 5-hydroxy-L-lysine kinase and that AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2 catalyzed the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of phosphoethanolamine and 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine. The three recombinant human proteins were produced and purified to homogeneity. AGPHD1 was indeed found to catalyze the GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy-L-lysine. The phosphorylation product made by this enzyme was metabolized by AGXT2L2, which converted it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde. AGXT2L1 catalyzed a similar reaction on phosphoethanolamine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate, and acetaldehyde. AGPHD1 and AGXT2L2 are likely to be the mutated enzymes in 5-hydroxylysinuria and 5-phosphohydroxylysinuria, respectively. The high level of expression of AGXT2L1 in human brain, as well as data in the literature linking AGXT2L1 to schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, suggest that these diseases may involve a perturbation of brain phosphoethanolamine metabolism. AGXT2L1 and AGXT2L2, the first ammoniophospholyases to be identified, belong to a family of aminotransferases acting on \u03c9-amines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Maria Veiga-da-Cunha","Farah Hadi","Thomas Balligand","Vincent Stroobant","Emile Van Schaftingen"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m111.323485","first_seen_on":"2015-02-16T00:13:23+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1369705651,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.m111.323485","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22241472"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/287\/10\/7246.full.pdf","pmid":"22241472","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular identification of hydroxylysine kinase and of the ammoniophospholyases acting on 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine and phosphoethanolamine.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-identification-hydroxylysine-kinase-ammoniophospholyases-acting-5phosphohydroxyllysine-pho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":816101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90856,"mean":8.5900027516374,"rank":24327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":65546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90856,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6379403751516,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":2.4789350649351,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"5-phosphonooxy-L-lysine phospho-lyase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=557104447#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3689713],"posted_on":"2013-05-28T01:47:31+00:00","summary":"This enzyme is a pyridoxal-phosphate protein.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39505591","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dcirovic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dcirovic"}}]}}
