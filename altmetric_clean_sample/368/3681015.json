The most potent congener V-165 inhibits HIV-1 integration at low micromolar concentrations by inhibiting the binding of IN to the DNA. As part of pre-clinical studies with PDP, we wanted to investigate HIV resistance development against V-165 and to further characterize the physicochemical properties of the compound.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c89","authors":["A.
