These segments are likely to represent autozygosity, the result of the mating of related individuals. Confidence that the complete segment is homozygous is gained only with markers of high density. The longest segment in the eight families spanned 77 cM and included 118 homozygous markers. All individuals in family 884 showed at least one segment of homozygosity: the father and mother were homozygous in 8 and 10 segments with an average length of 13 and 16 cM, respectively, and covering a total of 105 and 160 cM, respectively. The progeny in family 884 were homozygous over 5-16 segments with average length 11 cM. The progeny in family 102 were homozygous over 4-12 segments with average length 19 cM. Of the 100 individuals in the other six families, 1 had especially long homozygous segments, and 19 had short but significant homozygous segments. Our results indicate that long homozygous segments are common in humans and that these segments could have a substantial impact on gene mapping and health.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Broman, K W","Weber, J L"],"doi":"10.1086\/302661","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T21:35:25+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1322460763,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1086\/302661","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10577902","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1288359"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0002929707626779\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC1288359","pmid":"10577902","pubdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Long Homozygous Chromosomal Segments in Reference Families from  the Centre d'\u00c9tude du Polymorphisme Humain","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/long-homozygous-chromosomal-segments-reference-families-centre-detude-du-polymorphisme-humain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97480,"mean":8.1378410734622,"rank":25285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97480,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2911,"mean":6.3619298969072,"rank":914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2911,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.1222222222222,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
