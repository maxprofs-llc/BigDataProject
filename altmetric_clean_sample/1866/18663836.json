Although potential adherence barriers exist, it is not well understood how these factors impact adherence. Methods This is a prospective, single-center, patient survey-based study conducted at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center including 18- to 39-year-old patients who have been actively taking an oral anticancer medication for at least one month from 1 April 2013 to 1 April 2016. The primary objective of this study is to describe institutional practices for medication education and adherence monitoring practices as perceived by young adult patients at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center and to describe practice consistency with recommendations from the American Society of Clinical Oncology\/Oncology Nursing Society Chemotherapy Administration Safety Standards. The secondary objectives include patient-reported facilitators and barriers to oral anticancer medication adherence. Results Seventeen patients completed the survey; 24% ( n\u2009=\u20094) of patients denied receiving information about what to do in case of a missed dose. The most common facilitators of adherence include understanding of disease and treatment (88%, n\u2009=\u200915), perceived severity of illness (82%, n\u2009=\u200914), and use of oral anticancer medications (82%, n\u2009=\u200914). The most common barriers to adherence are side effects (59% n\u2009=\u200910), forgetfulness (47%, n\u2009=\u20098), and depressive symptoms (35%, n\u2009=\u20096). Conclusion Based on patient-reported guideline adherence, improvement is needed in including family, caregivers, and others in the education process as well as providing education about plan for missed doses and drug-drug and drug-food interactions. The strengths of the current medication education and adherence monitoring practices as perceived by the young adult patient population include education about the purpose and goals of treatment, the planned duration and schedule, side effects, and when to seek medical attention. The data collected from this survey can aid in future development and implementation of interventions aimed at improving medication adherence, such as integrating clinical pharmacy services into oral chemotherapy monitoring and education process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e98","authors":["Divakaruni, Anupama","Saylor, Elizabeth","Duffy, Alison P"],"doi":"10.1177\/1078155217703790","first_seen_on":"2017-04-09T06:17:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1078-1552","1477-092X"],"journal":"Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice","last_mentioned_on":1491718646,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1078155217703790?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R"],"pmid":"28387636","pubdate":"2017-04-09T22:07:08+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","pharmacy"],"title":"Assessing the need for improved strategies and medication-related education to increase adherence for oral anticancer medications in the young adult oncology population","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-need-improved-strategies-medicationrelated-education-increase-adherence-oral-anticancer-me"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":6949475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235656,"mean":12.849530296408,"rank":192490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235656,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":429,"mean":2.1316121495327,"rank":336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":429,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.509375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Ph.
