Adjusted logistic regression models were constructed to assess the risk for anemia and micronutrient deficiencies.\nIn preschoolers and scholars, the overall prevalence of anemia was 20.4 and 9.7%, iron deficiency 14 and 9.3%, low vitamin B12 (LB12S) 1.9 and 2.6%; Folate 0.30 and 0%, and retinol depletion (VADp) 15.7 and 2.3%, respectively. ID and VADp were negatively associated with Hb (coefficient: -0.38 and -0.45, p<0.05); a higher log-CRP was associated with higher risk for anemia and VADp (OR=1.13 and OR=2.1, p<0.05, respectively).\nIron deficiency, anemia and VADp are some of the main nutritional problems among Mexican infants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ba3cf058f6100055d7","authors":["Villalpando, Salvador","Cruz, Vanessa de la","Shamah-Levy, Teresa","Rebollar, Rosario","Contreras-Manzano, Alejandra"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T11:15:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1606-7916"],"issue":"5","journal":"Salud P\u00fablica de M\u00e9xico","last_mentioned_on":1495545607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26544998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26544998?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26544998","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Nutritional status of iron, vitamin B12, folate, retinol and anemia in children 1 to 11 years old: Results of the Ensanut 2012.","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-status-iron-vitamin-b12-folate-retinol-anemia-children-11-years-old-results-ensanut-2012"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":6263646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1115210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246423,"mean":9.7734791861116,"rank":168806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246423,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.0797872340426,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Neuroscience":1,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":4,"Unspecified":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/662951407121633280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4735638],"posted_on":"2015-11-07T11:15:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":159},"tweet_id":"662951407121633280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/vitamin_A_paper\/statuses\/867007233413963778","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4735638],"posted_on":"2017-05-23T13:20:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Vitamin A papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/646065900135817217\/TnQGHdDY_normal.jpg","description":"Twitter feed of #vitaminA papers published in #PubMed, + related content ranging from basic science to global health. #retinoids too!
