Efforts are ongoing to develop modalities that can enable simultaneous prevention of multiple sexually transmitted infections. In the present review, we discuss the potential of natural polyphenols to prevent sexually transmitted viral infections. The review gives an account of various in vitro and in vivo studies carried out on epigallocatechin gallate, theaflavins (black tea polyphenols), resveratrol, genistein and curcumin to highlight their potential to prevent sexually transmitted infections caused by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HSV (herpes simplex virus) and HPV (human papilloma virus).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","authors":["Date, Abhijit A","Destache, Christopher J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2015.10.019","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T11:55:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1878-5832"],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1446983686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26546859?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26546859","pubdate":"2015-11-08T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Natural polyphenols: Potential in the prevention of sexually transmitted viral infections.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-polyphenols-potential-prevention-sexually-transmitted-viral-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535340,"mean":6.0620751486637,"rank":4833786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":959673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535340,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211374,"mean":10.210580954048,"rank":145060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211374,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":830,"mean":4.9989264173703,"rank":643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":830,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.5199393939394,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
