However, the economic effectiveness of algal biofuel is still low. In this study, we attempted to increase oil production of the microalga Scenedesmus quadricauda by elevating intracellular malonyl-CoA and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pools. To increase intracellular oil content, yeast-derived genes encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), glycerol kinase (GPD1), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GUT1) were overexpressed under the control of CaMV 35S and NOS promoters with SV40 large T antigen components. Fatty acid profiling, G3P content, and the number of cells with high oil content were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, G3P assay kit, and flow cytometry, respectively. Overexpression of ACC1 increased the total fatty acid content by 1.6-fold. Overexpression of GPD1 and GUT1 increased intracellular G3P content by 1.6- and 1.9-fold, respectively. Multi-gene expression of ACC1, GPD1, and GUT1 increased the number of cells with high oil content by 1.45-fold compared with that observed with the wild-type. This study is the first to report increased oil production by overexpression of the key genes (ACC1, GPD1, and GUT1) for TAG biosynthesis in microalgae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007753","authors":["Gomma, Ahmed E","Lee, Sung-Kwon","Sun, Sang Mi","Yang, Seung Hwan","Chung, Gyuhwa"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12088-015-0546-4","endpage":"455","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T14:39:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0046-8991","0973-7715"],"issue":"4","journal":"Indian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1455903356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26543271?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26543271"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12088-015-0546-4.pdf","pmid":"26543271","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer India","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"447","title":"Improvement in Oil Production by Increasing Malonyl-CoA and Glycerol-3-Phosphate Pools in Scenedesmus quadricauda.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improvement-oil-production-increasing-malonylcoa-glycerol3phosphate-pools-scenedesmus-quadricauda"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5174963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1783888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240630,"mean":9.4843646941972,"rank":149131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":75730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240630,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":1.3524227642276,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.65625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
