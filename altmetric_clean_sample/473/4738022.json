The epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the introduction, expansion and phylogeny of the DENV isolates involved in this outbreak were investigated.\nA combination analyses of epidemiological characteristics and genetic diversity of dengue virus was performed in this study.\nIn total, 45,236 cases and 6 fatalities were reported. Unemployed individuals, retirees and retailers were the most affected populations. A total of 6,024 cases were verified to have DENV infections by nucleic acid detection, of which 5,947, 74 and 3 were confirmed to have DENV-1, -2, and -3 infections, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of DENV-1 isolates were assigned into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Genotype V was the predominant genotype that likely originated from Singapore. The DENV-2 isolates were assigned to the Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. A unique DENV-3 isolate (genotype III) shared high similarity with isolates obtained from Guangdong in 2013.\nA combination analyses demonstrated the multiple geographical origins of this outbreak, and highlight the importance of early detection, the case management and vector surveillance for preventing further dengue epidemics in Guangdong.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c4","authors":["Sun, Jiufeng","Wu, De","Zhou, Huiqiong","Zhang, Huan","Guan, Dawei","He, Xiang","Cai, Songwu","Ke, Changwen","Lin, Jinyan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinf.2015.10.007","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T12:03:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2742"],"journal":"Journal of Infection","last_mentioned_on":1446984186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26546854?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26546854","pubdate":"2015-11-08T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Epidemiological and genomic characteristics of a very large outbreak of Dengue in Guangdong, China.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiological-characteristics-genetic-diversity-dengue-virus-during-third-largest-historical-outbr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535340,"mean":6.0620751486637,"rank":5575667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535340,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211374,"mean":10.210582136791,"rank":168422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211374,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":2.7088294314381,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6178571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
