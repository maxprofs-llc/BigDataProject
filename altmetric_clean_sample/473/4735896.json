Therefore, monitoring immunogenicity was considered critical during clinical development of a second-generation, pegylated IFN-\u03b2 product, PEG-IFN-\u03b2-1a.\nAssays previously used to evaluate immunogenicity of IFN-\u03b2-1a were used to assess PEG-IFN-\u03b2-1a immunogenicity, with modifications to apply current best bioanalytical practices. A separate testing paradigm was used to monitor antibodies to polyethylene glycol.\nFinal assay cut points and relevant titer levels were established in-study. Immunogenicity evaluation strategies for second-generation therapeutics should take into consideration current best bioanalytical practices while retaining consistency with legacy assays to facilitate data comparison and interpretation. This study illustrates challenges in assessing immunogenicity of second-generation therapeutics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c2c","authors":["White, Joleen T","Crossman, Mary","Richter, Kelly","Berman, Melissa","Goyal, Jaya","Subramanyam, Meena","Joleen T White","Mary Crossman","Kelly Richter","Melissa Berman","Jaya Goyal","Meena Subramanyam"],"doi":"10.4155\/bio.15.197","endpage":"2811","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T11:52:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-6199","1757-6180"],"issue":"21","journal":"Bioanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1448367533,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26541956?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/bio.15.197"],"pmid":"26541956","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:01:11+00:00","startpage":"2801","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Immunogenicity evaluation strategy for a second-generation therapeutic, PEG-IFN-\u03b2-1a.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/10.4155\/bio.15.197","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunogenicity-evaluation-strategy-secondgeneration-therapeutic-pegifnbeta1a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7027725,"mean":6.2644400932622,"rank":5007604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1769095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7027725,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239764,"mean":9.4447340832405,"rank":147968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":76006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239764,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":480,"mean":1.7064091858038,"rank":267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":480,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.2233333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/662960723299962880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4735896],"posted_on":"2015-11-07T11:52:08+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":211},"tweet_id":"662960723299962880"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fsgfso\/statuses\/669128049250721792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4735896],"posted_on":"2015-11-24T12:18:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Future Science OA","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/q4tiPlRblq","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/534307524007034880\/rNTC4DiG_normal.jpeg","description":"Advances in basic, translational and clinical research for improving human health | #OpenAccess journal published by Future Science Group.
