Preoperative radiological, EUS, and final histopathologic diagnosis were correlated to measure several kinds of diagnostic performance.\nA total of 318 patients underwent preoperative MDCT, with additional imaging modalities such MRI and\/or EUS in 215 (67.6%) and 108 (34.0%) patients, respectively. \u03ba Values among the different modalities were as follows: MDCT versus pathology = 0.52 (P < 0.0001), MDCT + MRI versus pathology = 0.674 (P < 0.0001), and EUS versus pathology = 0.558 (P < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity in terms of ability to predict neoplastic cysts were as follows: MDCT, 83.1%\/70.0%; MDCT + MRI, 94.7%\/58.7%; and EUS, 88.5%\/52.9%. The diagnostic accuracies of MDCT and MDCT + MRI were 61.4% (62\/101) and 80.5% (173\/215), respectively, and that of EUS was 70.4% (76\/108).\nMagnetic resonance imaging as an additional diagnostic modality to MDCT increased the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well in terms of predicting neoplastic cysts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008447","authors":["Jang, Dong Kee","Song, Byeong Jun","Ryu, Ji Kon","Chung, Kwang Hyun","Lee, Ban Seok","Park, Joo Kyung","Lee, Sang Hyub","Kim, Yong-Tae","Lee, Jae Young"],"doi":"10.1097\/mpa.0000000000000396","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T14:25:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-4828","0885-3177"],"issue":"8","journal":"Pancreas","last_mentioned_on":1447601072,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pancreasjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/11000\/Preoperative_Diagnosis_of_Pancreatic_Cystic.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pancreasjournal\/2015\/11000\/Preoperative_Diagnosis_of_Pancreatic_Cystic.23.pdf","pmid":"26465956","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1329","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Preoperative Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: The Accuracy of Endoscopic Ultrasound and Cross-Sectional Imaging","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-diagnosis-pancreatic-cystic-lesions-accuracy-endoscopic-ultrasound-crosssectional-imagi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":4859582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":965533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211795,"mean":10.212562999896,"rank":145423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211795,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1598,"mean":1.2687989981215,"rank":735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1598,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.8715517241379,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PANCREASonline\/statuses\/663361610405163008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4738268],"posted_on":"2015-11-08T14:25:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Pancreas Online","url":"http:\/\/www.pancreasjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1090001998\/pancreascover_normal.jpg","description":"Pancreas is a forum for original works in basic & clinical research on the exocrine & endocrine pancreas, interrelationships & consequences in disease states","id_on_source":"PANCREASonline","tweeter_id":"172035240","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":511},"tweet_id":"663361610405163008"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PANCREASonline\/statuses\/665913278057439232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4738268],"posted_on":"2015-11-15T15:24:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Pancreas Online","url":"http:\/\/www.pancreasjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1090001998\/pancreascover_normal.jpg","description":"Pancreas is a forum for original works in basic & clinical research on the exocrine & endocrine pancreas, interrelationships & consequences in disease states","id_on_source":"PANCREASonline","tweeter_id":"172035240","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":511},"tweet_id":"665913278057439232"}]}}
