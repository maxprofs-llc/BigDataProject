Far above the spin glass temperature T_{g} where the magnetic moments of Mn impurities are randomly frozen, the spin Hall angle of a CuMnBi ternary alloy is as large as that of a CuBi binary alloy. Surprisingly, however, it starts to decrease at about 4T_{g} and becomes as little as 7 times smaller at 0.5T_{g}. A similar tendency was also observed in anomalous Hall effects in the ternary alloys. We propose an explanation in terms of a simple model considering the relative dynamics between the localized moment and the conduction electron spin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Niimi, Y","Kimata, M","Omori, Y","Gu, B","Ziman, T","Maekawa, S","Fert, A","Otani, Y"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.115.196602","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T07:53:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"19","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1450367580,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.196602","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.196602","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.115.196602"],"pmid":"26588404","pubdate":"2015-11-21T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Strong Suppression of the Spin Hall Effect in the Spin Glass State.","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strong-suppression-spin-hall-effect-spin-glass-state-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7194213,"mean":6.3246552767664,"rank":157418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7036360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7194213,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240531,"mean":9.4736516027106,"rank":9911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":230601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240531,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15179,"mean":10.417443932007,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":14433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15179,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":15.038713450292,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
