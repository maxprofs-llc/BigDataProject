However, both examinations can yield incorrect results and do not reveal the extent of ankle instability. Stress ultrasound has been reported to be a new diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of chronic ankle instability. The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of stress ultrasound for chronic ankle instability compared to the manual anterior drawer test, stress radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and arthroscopy.\nTwenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent ankle arthroscopy and subsequent modified Brostr\u00f6m repair for treatment of chronic ankle instability were included. The arthroscopic findings were used as the reference standard. A standardized physical examination (manual anterior drawer test), stress radiography, MRI, and stress ultrasound were performed to assess the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) prior to operation. Ultrasound images were taken in the resting position and the maximal anterior drawer position.\nGrade 3 lateral instability was verified arthroscopically in all 28 cases with a clinical diagnosis (100\u00a0%). Twenty-two cases showed grade III instability on the manual anterior drawer test (78.6\u00a0%). Twenty-four cases displayed anterior translation exceeding 5\u00a0mm on stress radiography (86\u00a0%), and talar tilt angle exceeded 15\u00b0 in three cases (11\u00a0%). Nineteen cases displayed a partial chronic tear (change in thickness or signal intensity), and nine cases displayed complete tear on MRI (100\u00a0%). Lax and wavy ATFL was evident on stress ultrasound in all cases (100\u00a0%). The mean value of the ATFL length was 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0cm for the stressed condition and 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0cm for the resting condition (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nStress ultrasound may be useful for the diagnosis of chronic ankle instability in addition to the manual anterior drawer test and stress radiography.\nIII.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fc1","authors":["Jae Ho Cho","Doo Hyung Lee","Hyung Keun Song","Joon Young Bang","Kyung Tai Lee","Young Uk Park"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00167-015-3828-9","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T01:46:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-7347"],"journal":"Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1446946684,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00167-015-3828-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00167-015-3828-9.pdf","pmid":"26515772","pubdate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","sportsmedicine"],"title":"Value of stress ultrasound for the diagnosis of chronic ankle instability compared to manual anterior drawer test, stress radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and arthroscopy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-stress-ultrasound-diagnosis-chronic-ankle-instability-compared-manual-anterior-drawer-test-str"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535340,"mean":6.0620751486637,"rank":4833785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":959673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535340,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211373,"mean":10.210597326041,"rank":145059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211373,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1018,"mean":4.0636774827925,"rank":710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1018,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":5.4125,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
