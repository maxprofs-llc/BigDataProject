Water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica), an aquatic perennial herb, is a common second intermediate host of Fasciola, and the fresh stems and leaves are widely used as a seasoning in the Korean diet. However, no information regarding Fasciola species contamination in water dropwort is available. Here, we collected 500 samples of water dropwort in 3 areas in Korea during February and March 2015, and the water dropwort contamination of Fasciola species was monitored by DNA sequencing analysis of the Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica specific mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2). Among the 500 samples assessed, the presence of F. hepatica cox1 and 1TS-2 markers were detected in 2 samples, and F. hepatica contamination was confirmed by sequencing analysis. The nucleotide sequences of cox1 PCR products from the 2 F. hepatica-contaminated samples were 96.5% identical to the F. hepatica cox1 sequences in GenBank, whereas F. gigantica cox1 sequences were 46.8% similar with the sequence detected from the cox1 positive samples. However, F. gigantica cox1 and ITS-2 markers were not detected by PCR in the 500 samples of water dropwort. Collectively, in this survey of the water dropwort contamination with Fasciola species, very low prevalence of F. hepatica contamination was detected in the samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f9e","authors":["Choi, In-Wook","Kim, Hwang-Yong","Quan, Juan-Hua","Ryu, Jae-Gee","Sun, Rubing","Lee, Young-Ha"],"doi":"10.3347\/kjp.2015.53.5.641","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T00:51:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1738-0006","0023-4001"],"issue":"5","journal":"Korean Journal of Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1464928264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26537044?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26537044?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26537044","pubdate":"2015-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Monitoring of Fasciola Species Contamination in Water Dropwort by cox1 Mitochondrial and ITS-2 rDNA Sequencing Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monitoring-fasciola-species-contamination-water-dropwort-cox1-mitochondrial-its2-rdna-sequencing-ana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":5953877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1050696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244710,"mean":9.5749002856453,"rank":168950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":41466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244710,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.5602647887324,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.94285714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ConcordeMedica\/statuses\/663156727681019905","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4737165],"posted_on":"2015-11-08T00:50:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Alex Concorde","url":"http:\/\/www.dralexconcorde.info\/#!health-and-medicine\/c224f","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1248165228\/concorde_medica_cropped__normal.jpg","description":"Dr Alex is creator of a unique 21C Individual Medicine called 'CruX'!
