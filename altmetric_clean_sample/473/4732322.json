Thus, the discovery of agents targeting soluble (A\u03b2) oligomers is highly desirable for early diagnosis prior to the manifestation of a clinical AD phenotype and also more effective therapies. We have previously reported that a novel 15 a.a peptide (15mer), isolated via phage display screening, targeted A\u03b2 and attenuated its neurotoxicity (1). The aim of the current study was to generate and biochemically characterise analogues of this peptide with improved stability and therapeutic potential. We demonstrated that a stable analogue of the 15 a.a. peptide (15M S.A.) retained the activity and potency of the parent peptide and demonstrated improved proteolytic resistance in vitro (stable to t=300min c.f. t=30min for the parent peptide). This candidate reduced the formation of soluble A\u03b242 oligomers with the concurrent generation of non-toxic insoluble aggregates measuring up to 25-30 nm diameter as determined by atomic force microscopy. The 15M S.A. candidate directly interacted with oligomeric A\u03b242, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation and Surface Plasmon Resonance\/Biacore analysis, with an affinity in the low micromolar range. Furthermore, this peptide bound fibrillar A\u03b242 and also stained plaques ex vivo in brain tissue from AD model mice. Given its multifaceted ability to target monomeric and aggregated A\u03b242 species, this candidate holds promise for novel preclinical AD imaging and therapeutic strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Barr, Renae K","Verdile, Giuseppe","Wijaya, Linda K","Morici, Michael","Taddei, Kevin","Gupta, Veer B","Pedrini, Steve","Jin, Liang","Nicolazzo, Joesph A","Knock, Erin","Fraser, Paul E","Martins, Ralph N","Renae K.
