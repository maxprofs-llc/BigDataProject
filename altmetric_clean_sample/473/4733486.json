Our aim was to investigate the influence of educational background (achieving university\/college degree (high) or not (low)) on the outcomes of early RA, in terms of disease activity (DAS28), pain (VAS-pain), and functional impairment (HAQ).\nWe evaluated DMARD-na\u00efve RA patients recruited in the Epidemiological Investigation of RA (EIRA) study with outcomes followed in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality (SRQ) register (N\u2009=\u20093021). Outcomes were categorized in three ways: 1) scores equal to\/above median vs. below median; 2) DAS28-based low disease activity, good response, remission; 3) scores decreased over the median vs. less than median. Associations between educational background and outcomes were calculated by modified Poisson regressions, at diagnosis and at each of the three standard (3, 6, 12 months) follow-up visits.\nPatients with different educational background had similar symptom durations (195 days) and anti-rheumatic therapies at baseline, and comparable treatment patterns during follow-up. Patients with a high education level had significantly less pain and less functional disability at baseline and throughout the whole follow-up period (VAS-pain: baseline: 49 (28-67) vs. 53 (33-71), p\u2009<0.0001; 1-year\u00a0visit: RR\u2009=\u20090.81 (95 % CI 0.73-0.90). HAQ: baseline: 0.88 (0.50-1.38) vs. 1.00 (0.63-1.50), p\u2009=\u20090.001; 1-year\u00a0visit: 0.84 (0.77-0.92)). They also had greater chances to achieve pain remission (VAS-pain\u2009\u226420) after one year (1.17 (1.07-1.28)). Adjustments for smoking and BMI altered the results only marginally. Educational background did not influence DAS28-based outcomes.\nIn Sweden, with tax-financed, generally accessible healthcare system, RA patients with a high education level experienced less pain and less functional disability. Further, these patients achieved pain remission more often during the first year receiving standard care. Importantly, education background affected neither time to referral to rheumatologists, disease activity nor anti-rheumatic treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","authors":["Xia Jiang","Maria EC Sandberg","Saedis Saevarsdottir","Lars Klareskog","Lars Alfredsson","Camilla Bengtsson"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13075-015-0836-6","first_seen_on":"2015-11-06T17:22:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-6354","1478-6362"],"issue":"1","journal":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1448599075,"links":["http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/17\/1\/317","http:\/\/www.arthritis-research.com\/content\/17\/1\/317"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arthritis-research.com\/content\/pdf\/s13075-015-0836-6.pdf","pmid":"26546562","pubdate":"2015-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"317","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Higher education is associated with a better rheumatoid arthritis outcome concerning for pain and function but not disease activity: results from the EIRA cohort and Swedish rheumatology register","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/higher-education-associated-better-rheumatoid-arthritis-outcome-concerning-pain-function-not-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":437402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6170977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210933,"mean":10.270686998654,"rank":23603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":187133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210933,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1320,"mean":4.9180940106141,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1320,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":8.5847428571429,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
