Thirty male participants completed three 10-min. simulated multitasks: MATB (Multi-Attribute Task Battery) with three workload levels. Twenty-five commonly used mental workload measures were collected, including heart rate, 12 HRV (heart rate variability), 10 EEG (electroencephalography) indices (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b8, \u03b1\/\u03b8, \u03b8\/\u03b2 from O1-O2 and F4-C4), and two subjective measures. Analyses of index sensitivity showed that two EEG indices, \u03b8 and \u03b1\/\u03b8 (F4-C4), one time-domain HRV-SDNN (standard deviation of inter-beat intervals), and four frequency-domain HRV: VLF (very low frequency), LF (low frequency), %HF (percentage of high frequency), and LF\/HF were sensitive to differentiate high workload. EEG \u03b1\/\u03b8 (F4-C4) and LF\/HF were most effective for monitoring high mental workload. LF\/HF showed the highest correlations with other physiological indices. EEG \u03b1\/\u03b8 (F4-C4) showed strong correlations with subjective measures across different mental workload levels. Operation strategy would affect the sensitivity of EEG \u03b1 (F4-C4) and HF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032c0","authors":["Bin-Wei Hsu"],"doi":"10.2466\/22.pms.121c12x5","first_seen_on":"2015-11-06T22:38:38+00:00","issns":["0031-5125"],"journal":"Perceptual & Motor Skills","last_mentioned_on":1446849525,"links":["http:\/\/www.amsciepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2466\/22.PMS.121c12x5"],"pmid":"26226284","pubdate":"2015-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"EFFECTIVE INDICES FOR MONITORING MENTAL WORKLOAD WHILE PERFORMING MULTIPLE TASKS1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effective-indices-monitoring-mental-workload-while-performing-multiple-tasks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535238,"mean":6.0548072239754,"rank":5575164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535238,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210013,"mean":10.257584204712,"rank":167321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210013,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":981,"mean":5.3961244897959,"rank":864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":981,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.409375,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
