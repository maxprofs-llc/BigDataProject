Seven stimulant-type drugs and metabolites were analyzed. These drugs included amphetamine (Amp), methamphetamine (Meth), methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), Coc and benzoylecgonine (BE, the major metabolite of Coc). These drugs were chosen because of their widespread use. Wastewater samples were collected at both the Oxford Waste Water Treatment Plant in Oxford, Mississippi (MS) and the University Wastewater Treatment Plant in University, MS. Samples were collected on weekends in which the Ole Miss Rebel football team held home games (Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, University, MS 38677). The collected samples were analyzed using a validated method and found to contain Amp, Meth, MDMA, Coc and BE. The concentrations of Amp and BE significantly rose in the university wastewater during football games.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7e","authors":["Gul, Waseem","Stamper, Brandon J","Godfrey, Murrell","ElSohly, Mahmoud A"],"doi":"10.1093\/jat\/bkv124","first_seen_on":"2015-11-09T09:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-2403"],"journal":"Journal of Analytical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1455807164,"links":["http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/11\/04\/jat.bkv124.long","http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/bkv124v1","https:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/40\/2\/124","http:\/\/jat.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/40\/2\/124"],"pmid":"26538543","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"LC-MS-MS Method for Stimulants in Wastewater During Football Games.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lcmsms-method-stimulants-wastewater-during-football-games"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":3644194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2050023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239958,"mean":9.4573821893089,"rank":123748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":91419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239958,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":5.5797826086957,"rank":390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":5.0902222222222,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bericonforensic\/statuses\/663645084622168064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4739914],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T09:11:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Bericon Forensics","url":"http:\/\/www.bericon.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/690616658944196608\/e8T2q7h8_normal.jpg","description":"The UK's oldest forensic science consultancy, pleased to have provided a One-Stop-Shop forensic service since 1982","id_on_source":"Bericonforensic","tweeter_id":"91345288","geo":{"lt":53.00415,"ln":-2.18538,"country":"GB"},"followers":3192},"tweet_id":"663645084622168064"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kingofxyz\/statuses\/663645672659382272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4739914],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T09:13:52+00:00","author":{"name":"JT Newell","url":"http:\/\/localegroup.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/637068444467269632\/yBXEYID9_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"kingofxyz","tweeter_id":"3463252157","geo":{"lt":"39.5162234","ln":"-76.9382069","country":"US"},"followers":754},"tweet_id":"663645672659382272"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bericonforensic\/statuses\/700330515799412736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4739914],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T14:46:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Bericon Forensics","url":"http:\/\/www.bericon.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/690616658944196608\/e8T2q7h8_normal.jpg","description":"The UK's oldest forensic science consultancy, pleased to have provided a One-Stop-Shop forensic service since 1982","id_on_source":"Bericonforensic","tweeter_id":"91345288","geo":{"lt":53.00415,"ln":-2.18538,"country":"GB"},"followers":3192},"tweet_id":"700330515799412736"}],"facebook":[{"title":"LC\u2013MS-MS Method for Stimulants in Wastewater During Football Games","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=856989891066674&id=288712264561109","license":"public","citation_ids":[4739914],"posted_on":"2015-11-09T09:11:36+00:00","summary":"Drug-taking football fans?
