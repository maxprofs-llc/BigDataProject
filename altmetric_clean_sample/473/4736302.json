Between January 2010 and December 2013 the CAMbrella consortium reviewed the status of CAM in Europe from the perspectives of: (1) terminology for description; (2) citizens' needs and expectations; (3) patients' usage patterns; (4) providers' practice patterns; and (5) regulatory and legal status in Europe. Together, this data was used to form a set of recommendations to the European Commission, the European Parliament, and national policy makers and civil society stakeholders. These recommendations can serve as a roadmap for European CAM research. Objective: This article aims to inform the reader about CAM prevalence, usage perspectives, and the future roadmap for CAM practices and research within the European Union. Method: This overview describes CAM status in the European Union, using the CAMbrella consortium projects as the source of information. Conclusions: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is positioned as a potential foundation for inclusion of CAM modalities within the militaries as well for as collaborative research on safe and cost-effective practices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000811e","authors":["Hegyi, Gabriella","Petri, Richard P","di Sarsina, Paolo Roberti","Niemtzow, Richard C"],"doi":"10.1089\/acu.2014.1085","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T15:32:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1933-6586"],"issue":"5","journal":"Medical Acupuncture","last_mentioned_on":1447792349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26543517"],"pmid":"26543517","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Overview of Integrative Medicine Practices and Policies in NATO Participant Countries.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overview-integrative-medicine-practices-policies-nato-participant-countries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":2720347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3707089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211105,"mean":10.246997243065,"rank":94798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":109492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211105,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":4.6330864197531,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":13.196181818182,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
