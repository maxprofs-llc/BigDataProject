Aim of this study is to compare the antirestenotic efficacy of two paclitaxel DEB with different coatings in the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) by means of a morphological and functional assessment.\nIn a single center, prospective, non-randomized study, the shellac-paclitaxel coated DIOR, and the urea-paclitaxel coated IN.PACT Falcon were compared in the setting of ISR. Quantitative angiography, fractional flow reserve (FFR), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed at baseline, postprocedure and 6-month follow-up. Main endpoints were QCA, FFR and OCT-based parameters of restenosis.\nForty-five patients were included, 20 (44\u00a0%) received treatment with the DIOR and 25 (56\u00a0%) with the IN.PACT Falcon. Angiographic and device success were 100 and 90\u00a0% for the DIOR, and 100 and 92\u00a0% for the IN.PACT Falcon, respectively. After 6-months, in-segment late lumen loss (-0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43 vs. 0.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48\u00a0mm, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and diameter stenosis (30.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.2 vs. 41.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.6\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.083) were lower for the IN.PACT Falcon. FFR distal of the stent was significantly higher in the IN.PACT Falcon group (0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 vs. 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and in-stent FFR gradient was lower (0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 vs. 0.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Between postprocedure and follow-up, a 16\u00a0% decrease in neointimal volume was observed for the IN.PACT Falcon, while a 30\u00a0% increase was observed for the DIOR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).\nThe IN.PACT Falcon DEB showed higher antirestenotic efficacy than the DIOR in the treatment of ISR, demonstrating that DEB with an excipient-based coating is not equally effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f20","authors":["Nijhoff, Freek","Stella, Pieter R","Troost, Maartje S","Belkacemi, Anouar","Nathoe, Hendrik M","Voskuil, Michiel","Samim, Mariam","Doevendans, Pieter A","Agostoni, Pierfrancesco"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00392-015-0934-0","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T09:18:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1861-0692"],"journal":"Clinical Research in Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1446887845,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26541146"],"pmid":"26541146","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:01:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Comparative assessment of the antirestenotic efficacy of two paclitaxel drug-eluting balloons with different coatings in the treatment of in-stent restenosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-assessment-antirestenotic-efficacy-two-paclitaxel-drugeluting-balloons-different-coating"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":5575303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210546,"mean":10.237946016291,"rank":167790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210546,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219,"mean":4.5148440366972,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1181818181818,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
