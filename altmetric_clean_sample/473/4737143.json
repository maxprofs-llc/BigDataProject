We hypothesized that SDB prevalence in younger Hispanic adults is higher than the limited evidence indicates.\nPopulation-based study of Hispanic subjects surveyed as part of the Chilean National Health Survey database. For this study, only subjects aged 15-40 years were included. Sleep and demographic questionnaires were used to assess SDB prevalence and its risk factors. Anthropometric measurements were performed in each subject. Prevalence was calculated for each SDB-related symptom. A regression model was constructed to investigate demographic risk factors of SDB.\nA total of 2,147 subjects were included. Mean age (\u00b1 SD) was 27.2 \u00b1 7.2 years, n=899 (42%) were males. Habitual snoring was highly prevalent with an average of 53.8% in men, and 38.3% in women. Snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime somnolence increased continuously with age with an abnormal SDB questionnaire score detected in 2.5%. Reported sleep duration was 7.61\u00b1 1.67 hours during weekdays, and 8.27 \u00b1 2.11 hours during weekends. Snoring frequency was significantly higher in men than women at nearly all age groups, and an adjusted regression model (Odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) identified male gender (2 [1.6-2.5]; p<0.001), and BMI (1.08 [1.03-1.12]; p<0.001) as independent risk factors for snoring.\nThe risk of SDB is highly prevalent in younger adults, even in females, and increases with age and BMI. The high prevalence and low awareness justify active screening and treatment of SDB in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["Pablo E.
