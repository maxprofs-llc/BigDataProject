Recent strides in polymer science has led to a combinatorial approach for generating a library of materials with different functional identity that can be \"mixed and matched\" to attain desired characteristics of the delivery vector. We have applied the combinatorial design to chitosan (CS) where the polymer backbone has been modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) binding peptide and lipid derivatives with varying chain length to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs. Cisplatin, cis-([PtCl2(NH3)2]) is one of the most potent chemotherapy drugs broadly administered for cancer treatment. Cisplatin is a hydrophilic drug and in order to be encapsulated in the developed nanosystems, it was modified with lipids of varying chain length. The library of four CS derivatives and six platinum derivatives were self-assembled in aqueous medium and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics and cytotoxic effects in platinum sensitive and resistant lung cancer cells. The results showed that the lipid-modified platinate encapsulation into CS nanoparticles has significantly improved cellular cytotoxicity of the drug. In this work, we have also reinforced the idea that chitosan is a multifaceted system that can be as successful in delivering small molecules as it has been as a nucleic acids carrier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Ana Vanessa Nascimento"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00642","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T16:24:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1543-8392"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1446926603,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00642?journalCode=mpohbp","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00642"],"pmid":"26523837","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Combinatorial-Designed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-Targeted Chitosan Nanoparticles for Encapsulation and Delivery of Lipid-Modified Platinum Derivatives in Wild-Type and Resistant Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combinatorialdesigned-epidermal-growth-factor-receptortargeted-chitosan-nanoparticles-encapsulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":4833451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":960042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211365,"mean":10.209625177419,"rank":145055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211365,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":5.5964824561404,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":2.3269047619048,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
