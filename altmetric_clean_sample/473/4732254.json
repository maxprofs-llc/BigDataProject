All samples were laboratory analyzed for their microbiological purity. The isolated strains were qualitatively identified. To identify the structure and arrangement of fibers that may support transport of microbial particles, a scanning electron microscopy analysis was performed.\nBoth settled and airborne fibers transported analogous microorganisms. All synthetic, semi-synthetic and silk fibers, present as separated threads with smooth surface, were free from microbial contamination. Natural fibers with loose packing and rough surface (e.g., wool, horse hair), sheaf packing and septated surface (e.g., flax, hemp) or present as twisted ribbons with corrugated surface (cotton) were able to carry up to 9\u00d7105 cfu\/g aerobic bacteria, 3.4\u00d7104 cfu\/g anaerobic bacteria and 6.3\u00d7104 cfu\/g of fungi, including pathogenic strains classified by Directive 2000\/54\/EC in hazard group 2.\nAs plant and animal fibers are contaminated with a significant number of microorganisms, including pathogens, all of them should be mechanically eliminated from the environment. In factories, if the manufacturing process allows, they should be replaced by synthetic or semi-synthetic fibers. To avoid unwanted exposure to harmful microbial agents on fibers, the containment measures that efficiently limit their presence and dissemination in both occupational and non-occupational environments should be introduced.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f61000602a","authors":["G\u00f3rny, Rafa\u0142 L","\u0141awniczek-Wa\u0142czyk, Anna","Stobnicka, Agata","Go\u0142ofit-Szymczak, Ma\u0142gorzata","Cyprowski, Marcin"],"doi":"10.13075\/mp.5893.00231","first_seen_on":"2015-11-06T11:26:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0465-5893"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medycyna Pracy","last_mentioned_on":1446809198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26536968?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26536968","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Fibers as carriers of microbial particles].","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wokna-jako-noniki-czstek-mikrobiologicznych"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535212,"mean":6.0548114281224,"rank":5575157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535212,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210013,"mean":10.257548492467,"rank":167321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210013,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.3330508474576,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
