Defects in neutrophil recruitment lead to impaired wound healing. Recent Advances: Chemokines and chemokine receptors are known to regulate neutrophil recruitment. Recent research advances reveal more mechanistic details about the regulation of chemokines and chemokine receptors on neutrophil egress from bone marrow, transmigration into the wound site, spatial navigation toward the necrotic skin tissue, and apoptosis-induced clearance by efferocytosis. Critical Issues: Skin injury triggers local and systemic alterations in the expression of multiple chemotactic molecules and the magnitude of chemokine receptor-mediated signaling. The responses of a number of CXC and CX3C chemokines and their receptors closely associate with the temporal and spatial recruitment of neutrophils to wound sites during the inflammatory phase and promote the clearance of necrotic neutrophils during the transition into the proliferative phase. Functional aberrancy in these chemokines and chemokine receptor systems is recognized as one of the important mechanisms underlying the pathology of impaired wound healing. Future Directions: Future research should aim to investigate the therapeutic modulation of neutrophil activity through the targeting of specific chemokines or chemokine receptors in the early inflammatory phase to improve clinical management of wound healing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056d6","authors":["Su, Yingjun","Richmond, Ann"],"doi":"10.1089\/wound.2014.0559","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T14:11:53+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2162-1918"],"issue":"11","journal":"Advances in Wound Care","last_mentioned_on":1446905497,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26543677?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26543677","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Chemokine Regulation of Neutrophil Infiltration of Skin Wounds.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemokine-regulation-neutrophil-infiltration-skin-wounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":5575303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210546,"mean":10.237946016291,"rank":167790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210546,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":3.4966165413534,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.55,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
