In this context, the gonadal maturation profile and fecundity of 0. niloticus was studied. Mature, spawning and spent females recorded in almost all the months of the year evidenced multiple and prolonged breeding behaviour. An overall sex ratio (M\/F) of 1: 1.08 observed was statistically non-significant from expected 1:1 ratio (chi2=6.994219, p=0.8642) indicating that males and females were statistically equal in number. The absolute fecundity ranged from 1192 to 4760 with mean of 2590 eggs from ovary weighing between 1.91 g to 28.89 g. Monthly changes in gonado-somatic index (GSI) revealed that fish bred throughout the year except in July and August, but at peak between October-November and March-June. Size at first maturity of male was estimated as 229.6 mm with confidence limit of 235.9 and 223.6 mm and for female as 238.1 mm with confidence limit of 244.7 and 231.7 mm, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006636","authors":["Absar, Alam","Chadha, N K","Joshi, K D","Chakraborty, S K","Sawant, P B","Kumar, Tarkeshwar","Sharma, A p"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T11:30:19+00:00","issns":["0254-8704"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Environmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1446895804,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26364471?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26364471","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Maturation profile and fecundity of the exotic Oreochromis niloticus in the River Yamuna, India.","type":"article","volume":"36"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":4833451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":960042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210547,"mean":10.237898577983,"rank":144539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210547,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":1.4662881355932,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.7857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cichlid_papers\/statuses\/662955172285382656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4735777],"posted_on":"2015-11-07T11:30:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Cichlid Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/512589381949857793\/g0Sl-a4e_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot of cichlid PubMed papers (inspired by @fly_papers).
