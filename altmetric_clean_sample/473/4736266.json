The Ab-\/scFv-conjugated MSN were prepared by the conjugation of amine functional group of antibody of the carboxyl group of MSN. The resultant MSN was nanosized, spherical shaped, and exhibited a controlled release phenomenon in pH 7.4 conditions. Furthermore, BMSN\/Ab was found to increase the cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of BVC in OVCAR-5 cancer cells. The Ab- conjugated MSN exhibited a superior anticancer effect with profound apoptosis in cancer cells in a time- and concentration dependent manner. Consistently, BMSN\/Ab effectively inhibited the colony formation in transwell plate. Finally, BMSN\/Ab showed a notable increase in the proportion of cells in G2\/M phase of cell cycle indicating promising anticancer efficacy profile. Overall, Ab-\/scFv-conjugated MSN might provide an effective strategy for the therapeutic management of ovarian cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b89","authors":["Zhang, Ying","Guo, Jing","Zhang, Xiao-Ling","Li, Da-Peng","Zhang, Ting-Ting","Gao, Fu-Feng","Liu, Nai-Fu","Sheng, Xiu-Gui"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijpharm.2015.10.080","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T15:13:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3476"],"journal":"International Journal of Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1446909187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26541303?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26541303","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:01:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Antibody Fragment-armed Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for the Targeted Delivery of Bevacizumab in Ovarian Cancer Cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibody-fragmentarmed-mesoporous-silica-nanoparticles-targeted-delivery-bevacizumab-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535344,"mean":6.0554444909764,"rank":5575303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535344,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210546,"mean":10.237946016291,"rank":167790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210546,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":983,"mean":1.802849287169,"rank":695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":983,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.5429411764706,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
