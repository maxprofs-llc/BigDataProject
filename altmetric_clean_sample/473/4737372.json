Modest to strong positive correlations were found in five studies from Western countries and six studies from a Japanese meta-analysis. The results for Russian twins were compared with those of the Western and Japanese studies. Data from 402 twins aged 13 and 296 twins aged 16 showed correlations of r=-0.45 and r=-0.60, respectively. It is concluded that the two data points are clearly not in line with established findings. It may be that the link between g loadings and heritabilities is more complex than previously thought.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cbb","authors":["Ivan\u00a0Voronin","Jan\u00a0Te Nijenhuis","Sergey B.\u00a0Malykh"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0021932015000395","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T04:05:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-7599"],"journal":"Journal of Biosocial Science","last_mentioned_on":1467980590,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10020237&fileId=S0021932015000395"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0021932015000395","pmid":"26507902","pubdate":"2015-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"THE CORRELATION BETWEEN <i>g<\/i> LOADINGS AND HERITABILITY IN RUSSIA","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-g-loadings-heritability-russia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":3338614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4639948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246058,"mean":9.6723880076568,"rank":87338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":156088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246058,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":4.7536453488372,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SR71999\/statuses\/663205614198198272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4737372],"posted_on":"2015-11-08T04:05:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Sketch Of Person","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/822915352371703808\/4yeJJWe6_normal.jpg","description":"Curator of this account.
