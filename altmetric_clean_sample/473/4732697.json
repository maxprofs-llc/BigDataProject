We isolated suppressor mutations that restored the capacity of a smc deletion mutant (\u0394smc) to grow under standard conditions. These suppressor mutations reduced chromosome segregation defects and abrogated hypersensitivity to gyrase inhibitors of \u0394smc. Three suppressor mutations were mapped in genes involved in tRNA aminoacylation and maturation pathways. A transcriptomic survey of isolated suppressor mutations pointed to a potential link between suppression of \u0394smc and induction of the stringent response. This link was confirmed by (p)ppGpp quantification which indicated a constitutive induction of the stringent response in multiple suppressor strains. Furthermore, sublethal concentrations of arginine hydroxamate (RHX), a potent inducer of stringent response, restored growth of \u0394smc under non permissive conditions. We showed that production of (p)ppGpp alone was sufficient to suppress the thermosensitivity exhibited by the \u0394smc mutant. Our findings shed new light on the coordination between chromosome dynamics mediated by SMC-ScpAB and other cellular processes during rapid bacterial growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Camille Benoist","Cyprien Gu\u00e9rin","Philippe Noirot","Etienne Dervyn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0142308","first_seen_on":"2015-11-06T13:08:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1446815270,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0142308"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0142308.PDF","pmid":"26539825","pubdate":"2015-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0142308","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Constitutive Stringent Response Restores Viability of Bacillus subtilis Lacking Structural Maintenance of Chromosome Protein","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/constitutive-stringent-response-restores-viability-bacillus-subtilis-lacking-structural-maintenance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535212,"mean":6.0548114281224,"rank":5575157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535212,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210012,"mean":10.257596144964,"rank":167321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210012,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99357,"mean":9.8134528765249,"rank":83497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5431,"mean":9.7863959484346,"rank":4442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5431,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
