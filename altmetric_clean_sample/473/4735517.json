Cerebral malperfusion with TAAD has been linked to poorer outcome. We hypothesize that concomitant carotid dissection or complex dissection flaps in the arch play a major role in stroke development and that aggressive reconstruction of the arch and carotid arteries can improve neurologic outcomes in TAAD.\nA standardized protocol focused on expedient care, neurocerebral protection, and common carotid and total arch reconstruction was developed for 264\u00a0consecutive TAADs. Arch and complete carotid replacement was based on arch dissection anatomy, carotid involvement, or an intraarch tear. Neurocerebral monitoring with continuous electroencephalogram\/somatosensory evoked potentials was used in all cases.\nThe postoperative stroke and hospital mortality rates were 3.4% and 9.1%, and stroke rates by extent of arch replacement were 4%, 3%, and 0% for hemiarch, total arch, and total arch with complete carotid replacement, respectively. An intraoperative change in the electroencephalogram\/somatosensory evoked potentials was strongly predictive of stroke and had a negative predictive value of 98.2%.\nAn algorithmic approach to TAAD including (1) rapid transport-to-incision-to-cardiopulmonary bypass established centrally, (2) neurocerebral monitoring, (3) liberal use of total arch replacement for clearly defined indications (and hemiarch for all others), and (4) common carotid arterial replacement for concomitant carotid dissections significantly improves outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Trivedi, Dhaval","Navid, Forozan","Balzer, Jeffrey R","Joshi, Rama","Lacomis, Joan M","Jovin, Tudor G","Althouse, Andrew D","Gleason, Thomas G"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2015.08.073","endpage":"905","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T11:08:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-6259","0003-4975","00034975"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1474347764,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26542439?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2015.08.073","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003497515014344"],"pmid":"26542439","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:01:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"896","subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Aggressive Aortic Arch and Carotid Replacement Strategy for Type A Aortic Dissection Improves Neurologic Outcomes","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aggressive-aortic-arch-carotid-replacement-strategy-type-aortic-dissection-improves-neurologic-outco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":1358575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7046914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248117,"mean":9.7635366441502,"rank":50180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":197767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248117,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3496,"mean":3.8213310443491,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3496,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":4.0870078740157,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
