Here, we report the crystal structure of human NRMT1 bound to CENP-A peptide at 1.3 \u00c5. NRMT1 adopts a core methyltransferase fold that resembles DOT1L and PRMT but not SET domain family histone methyltransferases. Key substrate recognition and catalytic residues were identified by mutagenesis studies. Histone peptide profiling revealed that human NRMT1 is highly selective to human CENP-A and fruit fly H2B, which share a common \"Xaa-Pro-Lys\/Arg\" motif. These results, along with a 1.5 \u00c5 costructure of human NRMT1 bound to the fruit fly H2B peptide, underscore the importance of the NRMT1 recognition motif.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Wu, Ruoxi","Yue, Yuan","Zheng, Xiangdong","Li, Haitao"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.270926.115","first_seen_on":"2015-11-07T14:05:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-5477"],"journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1456918628,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26543159?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/gad.270926.115"],"pmid":"26543159","pubdate":"2015-11-07T22:00:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Molecular basis for histone N-terminal methylation by NRMT1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-basis-histone-nterminal-methylation-nrmt1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":3673954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4305550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245358,"mean":9.73610850312,"rank":99952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":140975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245358,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3056,"mean":5.415305400982,"rank":1808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3056,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":9.6707916666667,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
