This screen revealed four candidate ion channel genes: Kcnq1, Kcnj10, Kcnf1 and Clcn4. We show that these four ion channels localize to renal tubules, specifically to the base of primary cilia. We report that human KCNQ1 Long QT syndrome disease alleles, regulate renal ciliogenesis; KCNQ1-p.R518X, -p.A178T and -p.K362R could not rescue ciliogenesis after Kcnq1 siRNA-mediated depletion in contrast to wild-type KCNQ1 and benign KCNQ1-p.R518Q, suggesting that the ion channel function of KCNQ1 regulates ciliogenesis. In contrast, we demonstrate that the ion channel function of KCNJ10 is independent of its effect on ciliogenesis. Our data suggest that these four ion channels possibly regulate renal ciliogenesis through the periciliary diffusion barrier or the ciliary pocket, with potential implication as genetic contributors to ciliopathy pathophysiology. The new functional roles of a subset of ion channels provide new insights into the disease pathogenesis of channelopathies and may suggest future therapeutic approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Slaats, Gisela G","Wheway, Gabrielle","Foletto, Veronica","Szymanska, Katarzyna","van Balkom, Bas W M","Logister, Ive","Den Ouden, Krista","Keijzer-Veen, Mandy G","Lilien, Marc R","Knoers, Nine V","Johnson, Colin A","Giles, Rachel H"],"doi":"10.1242\/jcs.176065","first_seen_on":"2015-11-08T11:30:52+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"issns":["1477-9137"],"journal":"Journal of Cell Science","last_mentioned_on":1452160230,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26546361?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jcs.biologists.org\/content\/early\/2015\/11\/05\/jcs.176065.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26546361"],"pmid":"26546361","pubdate":"2015-11-08T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Screen-based identification and validation of four novel ion channels as regulators of renal ciliogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screenbased-identification-validation-four-new-ion-channels-regulators-renal-ciliogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6917999,"mean":6.2117021646992,"rank":2500620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4366136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6917999,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239980,"mean":9.4057858979327,"rank":78294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":159592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239980,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2998,"mean":4.2445825825825,"rank":1388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2998,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.6837272727273,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
