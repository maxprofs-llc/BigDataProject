A significant (P < 0.05) increase in pH (7.40 to 7.47), oxygenated base excess (OxyBE) (-1.3 to 4.0 mEq.L-1), and bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3-]) (22.8 to 27.4 mM) was achieved before exercise with the ingestion of NaHCO3.\nThe exercise protocol produced significant changes in acid base status consistent with metabolic acidosis for both trials (pH sets 1-5: placebo, 7.4 to 7.26; NaHCO3, 7.47 to 7.33), (OxyBE sets 1-5: placebo, -1.3 to -12.3 mEq.L-1; NaHCO3, 4.0 to -6.9 mEq.L-1) and ([HCO3-] sets 1-5: placebo, 22.9 to 14.0 mM; NaHCO3, 27.4 to 17.6 mM). After every set; pH, OxyBE, and [HCO3-] were significantly higher in the NaHCO3 trial. Blood lactate concentration ([La-]) significantly increased throughout exercise for both trials ([La-] sets 1-5: placebo, 4.6 to 11.3 mM; NaHCO3, 4.8 to 13.4 mM). After sets 4 and 5, blood [La-] was significantly higher in the NaHCO3 trial. Bicarbonate ingestion did not improve performance (total repetitions: NaHCO3 = 59 +\/- 3; placebo = 60 +\/- 2).\nThis may be a result of a lower demand on the whole body metabolic system in comparison with that for other modes of exercise in which ergogenic effects have been found.","authors":["Portington, K J","Pascoe, D D","Webster, M J","Anderson, L H","Rutland, R R","Gladden, L B"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-14T22:42:37+00:00","issns":["0195-9131"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medicine and science in sports and exercise","last_mentioned_on":1479163343,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/9565933\/?i=3&from=\/27747796\/related"],"pmid":"9565933","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effect of induced alkalosis on exhaustive leg press performance.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-induced-alkalosis-exhaustive-leg-press-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
