Intravaginal practices can disrupt the genital mucosa, and some studies have found that IVP increases risk of acquisition of HIV and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Limited prior research also suggests significant associations between IVP, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV).\nWe examined associations between IVP and HPV, BV, and HSV-2 among 200 women in rural Malawi participating in a clinic-based study on sexual and reproductive tract infections. We calculated prevalence ratios for the associations between frequency and type of IVP and outcomes of HPV, BV, and HSV-2.\nIntravaginal practices were commonly performed, with 95% of women reporting current use of at least 1 practice. Infections were also frequently detected: Twenty-two percent of the sample had at least 1 high-risk HPV type, 51% had BV, and 50% were HSV-2 seropositive. We observed no significant associations between type of IVP, frequency of IVP, or a combined measure capturing type and frequency of IVP-and any of the infection outcomes.\nAlthough both IVP and our outcomes of interest (BV, HPV, and HSV-2) were common in the study population, we did not detect associations between IVP type or frequency and any of the 3 infections. However, the high prevalence and frequency of IVP may have limited our ability to detect significant associations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003524","authors":["Esber, Allahna","Rao, Nisha","Norris, Alison","Carr Reese, Patricia","Kandodo, Jonathan","Nampandeni, Patrick","Jumbe, Enock","Norris Turner, Abigail"],"doi":"10.1097\/olq.0000000000000531","endpage":"755","first_seen_on":"2016-11-14T19:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-4521","0148-5717"],"issue":"12","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1480667734,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27835627"],"pmid":"27835627","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"750","subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Intravaginal Practices and Prevalence of Sexual and Reproductive Tract Infections Among Women in Rural Malawi","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intravaginal-practices-prevalence-sexual-reproductive-tract-infections-among-women-rural-malawi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":5665053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1892988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229610,"mean":12.932178642823,"rank":147812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229610,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1366,"mean":4.4151384615385,"rank":1108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1366,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":10.038689655172,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HIV_Insight\/statuses\/798241675734818816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13605100],"posted_on":"2016-11-14T19:10:20+00:00","author":{"name":"HIV Insight","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/587408973\/INSIGHT_ICON_normal.gif","description":"HIV, AIDS, STI, STD, HPV, Sexuality, LGBT, et al.
