Quality improvement (QI) projects are a way to improve patient care as well as facilitate education on this core competency. There are inherent barriers to completing these goals in the structure of residency training including rigorous resident schedules and a limited number of projects and resources.\nWe developed a QI programme using an experiential class project and incorporated it into our Internal Medicine Resident Core Curriculum to improve the residents' knowledge of QI methods. We assessed the residents' experience, knowledge and interest in practice and QI subject matter with a survey preimplementation and postimplementation.\nIn 2009, 24 residents in the Internal Medicine resident programme completed a survey measuring their experience, knowledge and interest in QI initiatives. They then completed a QI 1-year programme, with monthly, 1-hour sessions combining didactics and a resident-designed project. At the conclusion of the year, the residents completed the same survey, and the results were compared and analysed.\nPostcurriculum questionnaires revealed residents were more knowledgeable about QI methods, showing improvement in knowledge about institutional-wide QI projects, better preparation for implementing a QI project, and more likely to participate in QI in the future. The project completed was one which improved patients' knowledge of their anticipated date of discharge from the hospital.\nA class quality project can teach QI to residents incorporating both didactic and practical methods to maximise the experience and minimise the barriers. We found that this method improved residents experience, knowledge and interest in quality initiatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["Duello, Katherine","Louh, Irene","Greig, Hope","Dawson, Nancy"],"doi":"10.1136\/postgradmedj-2014-132886","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T14:00:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-0756"],"journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1439472701,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26253922?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/postgradmedj-2014-132886"],"pmid":"26253922","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Residents\u2019 knowledge of quality improvement: the impact of using a group project curriculum","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/residents-knowledge-quality-improvement-impact-using-group-project-curriculum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5480898,"mean":6.3650870917652,"rank":2011778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3459912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5480898,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191634,"mean":8.9746576320364,"rank":62019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":129111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191634,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1151,"mean":6.0570069565217,"rank":493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1151,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":18.132933333333,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UofTPGME\/statuses\/631102774877519872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4384762],"posted_on":"2015-08-11T14:00:01+00:00","author":{"name":"U of T PGME","url":"http:\/\/pg.postmd.utoronto.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/494146016401035266\/b66dBik1_normal.png","description":"As part of one of the oldest and largest medical schools in Canada, we train residents & fellows in patient-centered care & team-driven approaches in medicine.","id_on_source":"UofTPGME","tweeter_id":"833626914","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2820},"tweet_id":"631102774877519872"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drlynnwilson\/statuses\/631800151309467652","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4384762],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:11:09+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"drlynnwilson","tweeter_id":"603724114","geo":{"lt":43.70011,"ln":-79.4163,"country":"CA"}},"tweet_id":"631800151309467652"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChebogueRiver\/statuses\/631800538879893504","license":"gnip","rt":["drlynnwilson"],"citation_ids":[4384762],"posted_on":"2015-08-13T12:12:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Kevin Doucette","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/653915187410522112\/yQ57-3vJ_normal.jpg","description":"Re-tweets don't imply endorsement;
