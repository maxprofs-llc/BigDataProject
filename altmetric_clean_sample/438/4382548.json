Optimizing psychosocial and supportive care is critical, especially in the later stages of disease.\nThis retrospective cohort study compared early versus late hospice enrollment of PMBT patients admitted to the home hospice program of a large urban, not-for-profit home health care agency between 2009 and 2013.\nOf 160 patients with PMBT followed to death in hospice care, 32 (22.5%) were enrolled within 7 days of death. When compared with patients referred to hospice more than 7 days before death, a greater proportion of those with late referral were bedbound at admission (97.2% vs 61.3%; OR=21.85; 95% CI, 3.42-919.20; P < .001), aphasic (61.1% vs 20.2%; OR = 6.13; 95% CI, 2.59-15.02; P < .001), unresponsive (38.9% vs 4%; OR = 14.76,;95% CI, 4.47-57.98; P < .001), or dyspneic (27.8% vs 9.7%; OR = 21.85; 95% CI, 3.42-10.12; P = .011). In multivariable analysis, male patients who were receiving Medicaid or charitable care and were without a health care proxy were more likely to enroll in hospice within 1 week of death.\nLate hospice referral in PMBT is common. PMBT patients enrolled late in hospice are severely neurologically debilitated at the time hospice is initiated and therefore may not derive optimal benefit from multidisciplinary hospice care. Men, patients with lower socioeconomic status, and those without a health care proxy may be at risk for late hospice care and may benefit from proactive discussion about end-of-life care in PMBT, but prospective studies are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000828a","authors":["Eli L.
