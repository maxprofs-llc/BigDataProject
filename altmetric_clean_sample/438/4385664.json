The genetic cause of CLS is unknown. We performed a genome screen, using DNA from eight Norwegian patients with CLS and from seven unaffected relatives, all from an extended pedigree. Regions potentially shared identical by descent in patients were further characterized in a larger set of Norwegian patients. The patients manifest extensive allele and haplotype sharing over the 6.6-cM D15S979-D15S652 region: 30 (83.3%) of 36 chromosomes of affected individuals carry a six-marker haplotype not found on any of the 32 nontransmitted parental chromosomes. All Norwegian patients with CLS are likely homozygous for the same disease mutation, inherited from a shared ancestor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Bull, L N","Roche, E","Song, E J","Pedersen, J","Knisely, A S","van Der Hagen, C B","Eiklid, K","Aagenaes, O","Freimer, N B"],"doi":"10.1086\/303080","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T18:59:37+00:00","issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1436372871,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1086\/303080"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0002929707632935\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC1287903","pmid":"10968776","pubdate":"2000-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Mapping of the Locus for Cholestasis-Lymphedema Syndrome (Aagenaes Syndrome) to a 6.6-cM Interval on Chromosome 15q","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mapping-locus-cholestasislymphedema-syndrome-aagenaes-syndrome-66cm-interval-chromosome-15q"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5328866,"mean":6.2435257016281,"rank":1339824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3373043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5328866,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186743,"mean":9.0381608636515,"rank":58366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":126233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186743,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3067,"mean":9.8458173515982,"rank":1191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3067,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":14.596088888889,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
