A chart review identified patients who developed high IOP at any postoperative examination and a minimum follow-up period of 3\u00a0months after ICL implantation. Data are reported out to 6\u00a0months postoperatively. Outcome measures included causes of elevated IOP, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at last visit, number of glaucoma medications, other interventions, and glaucomatous damage. Elevated IOP occurred in 58 (10.8\u00a0%) of 534 eyes that received ICL. The mean age was 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2\u00a0years. The preoperative IOP was 16.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0mmHg. Elevated IOP most commonly occurred on the first postoperative day (23\/58 (39.7\u00a0%) eyes) due to retained viscoelastic. This was followed by steroid response in 22\/58 (37.9\u00a0%) eyes at 2-4\u00a0weeks postoperatively. IOP elevation in 6 (10.3\u00a0%) eyes was related to high ICL vault and pupillary block, and in 4 (6.9\u00a0%) eyes due to synechial angle closure. At last visit, BCVA was 20\/40 or better in 56\/58 (96.6\u00a0%) eyes, and 5\/58 (8.6\u00a0%) eyes remained on glaucoma medications due to persistent steroid response (2 eyes), synechial angle closure glaucoma (1 eye), and other causes (2 eyes). One eye showed glaucomatous damage. Two eyes with high vault and elevated IOP underwent ICL explantation. There is a moderate risk of transiently developing elevated IOP after ICL implantation. Thorough removal of viscoelastic and use of anti-glaucoma medications during steroid use will reduce the majority of cases with postoperative IOP elevation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a43","authors":["Salem Almalki","Abdullah Abubaker","Nasser A.
