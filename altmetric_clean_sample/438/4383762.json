Immune cells get access into the brain region, after infection in the blood brain barrier (BBB) due to bacteria\/virus or by genetic predisposition, where the autoimmune response may induce the demyelination, inflammation as well as neurodegeneration in brain areas. Various types of therapeutics are used worldwide approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) for the management of MS. Hence, side effects of conventional therapy go hand in hand. The advancement in nanomedicines have opened window for the management of various disorders of neurodegeneration including MS. Various clinical trials are in process to explore the etiology of MS and in this connection animal models like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) have promising outcomes for the management of MS by using nanomedicines that give new insights. The current review elaborates the scope of nanomedicines with respect to MS patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002667","authors":["Rasool, Mahmood","Malik, Arif","Manan, Abdul","Ansari, Shakeel Ahmed","Asif, Muhammad","Qazi, Mahmood Husain","Kamal, Mohammad Amjad","Pushparaj, Peter Natesan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T10:25:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-5453"],"journal":"Current Drug Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1439290929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26255769?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26255769","pubdate":"2015-08-11T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","metabolism"],"title":"Scope and Applications of Nanomedicines for the Management of Multiple Sclerosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/scope-applications-nanomedicines-management-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":2717811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2589331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191537,"mean":8.9710123527693,"rank":94789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":88293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191537,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.3316544502618,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4615384615385,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bbbpapers\/statuses\/631048678971539456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4383762],"posted_on":"2015-08-11T10:25:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood brain barrier","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440531504972578816\/fylYz-PG_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #bbb papers in #PubMed.
