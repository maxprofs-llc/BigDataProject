The NVDRS collects information from 32 states on several types of violent deaths, including suicides, homicides, homicides followed by suicides, and deaths resulting from child maltreatment or intimate partner violence, as well as legal intervention and accidental firearm deaths. Despite the availability of data from police narratives, medical examiner reports, and other sources, reliably finding the cases of murder-suicide in the NVDRS has proven problematic due to the lack of a unique code for murder-suicide incidents and outdated descriptions of case-finding procedures from previous researchers. By providing a description of the methods used to access to the NVDRS and coding procedures used to decipher these data, the authors seek to assist future researchers in correctly identifying cases of murder-suicide deaths while avoiding false positives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["McNally, Matthew R.","Patton, Christina L.","Fremouw, William J."],"doi":"10.1111\/1556-4029.12887","endpage":"248","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T16:20:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-4029"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Forensic Sciences (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1439223602,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12887\/abstract;jsessionid=10CF84685BC2F9202A417A9526C85D05.f01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12887\/pdf","pmid":"26258816","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"245","subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Mining for Murder\u2010Suicide: An Approach to Identifying Cases of Murder\u2010Suicide in the National Violent Death Reporting System Restricted Access Database","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mining-murdersuicide-approach-identifying-cases-murdersuicide-national-violent-death-reporting-syste"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6407634,"mean":5.9857722172913,"rank":5458996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6407634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189193,"mean":9.0966052158654,"rank":151328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189193,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":4.5149147442327,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.536431372549,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
