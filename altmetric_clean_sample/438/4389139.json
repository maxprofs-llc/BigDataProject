While myelin damage might partly originate from HIV-induced vascular changes, the timing suggests that myelin and\/or oligodendrocytes (OLs) may be directly affected. Histological (Golgi-Kopsch, electron microscopy) and biochemical studies have revealed an increased occurrence of abnormal OL\/myelin morphology and dysregulated myelin protein expression in transgenic mice expressing the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein. This suggests that viral proteins by themselves might cause OL injury. Since Tat interacts with NMDARs, we hypothesized that activation of NMDARs and subsequent disruption of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) homeostasis might be one cause of white matter injury after HIV infection. In culture, HIV-1 Tat caused concentration-dependent death of immature OLs, while more mature OLs remained alive but had reduced myelin-like membranes. Tat also induced [Ca(2+)]i increases and Thr-287 autophosphorylation of Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II \u03b2 (CaMKII\u03b2) in OLs. Tat-induced [Ca(2+)]i was attenuated by the NMDAR antagonist MK801, and also by the AMPA\/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX. Importantly, both MK801 and CNQX blocked Tat-induced death of immature OLs, but only MK801 reversed Tat effects on myelin-like membranes. These results suggest that OLs can be direct targets of HIV proteins released from infected cells. Although viability and membrane production are both affected by glutamatergic receptor-mediated Ca(2+) influx, and possibly the ensuing CaMKII\u03b2 activation, the roles of AMPARs and NMDARs appear to be different and dependent on the stage of OL differentiation.\nOver 33 million individuals are currently infected by HIV. Among these individuals, \u223c60% develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. Myelin damage and white matter injury have been frequently reported in HIV patients but not extensively studied. Clinical studies using combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) together with adjunctive \"anti-inflammatory\" drugs show no improvement over cART alone, suggesting existence of injury mechanisms in addition to inflammation. In our studies, oligodendrocytes exhibited rapid increases in intracellular Ca(2+) level upon HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) exposure. Thus, immature and mature oligodendrocytes can be direct targets of Tat. Since ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists can partially or fully reverse the detrimental effects of Tat, glutamate receptors could be a potential therapeutic target for white matter damage in HIV patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Shiping Zou","Babette Fuss","Sylvia Fitting","Yun Kyung Hahn","Kurt F.
