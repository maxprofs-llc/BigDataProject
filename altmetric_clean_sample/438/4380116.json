The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a decrease in sedentary behavior on CVD risk factors among 205 individuals living in rural Appalachia. All participants received a comprehensive CVD risk reduction life-style intervention and measurement of major CVD risk factors and physical activity levels. Participants were divided into: 1) Adopters: those who decreased their sedentary behavior by 30 min or more per day post-intervention and 2) Non-adopters: those who did not. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant group by time interaction showing that Adopters had a greater reduction in body weight and BMI than Non-adopters. These findings demonstrate that decreasing sedentary behavior is important for achieving optimal body weight.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000593e","authors":["Saleh, Zyad T","Lennie, Terry A","Mudd-Martin, Gia","Bailey, Alison L","Novak, Michael J","Biddle, Martha","Khalil, Amani A","Darawad, Muhammad","Moser, Debra K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hrtlng.2015.06.008","endpage":"386","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T12:03:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs"],"issns":["1527-3288","0147-9563","01479563"],"issue":"5","journal":"Heart & Lung","last_mentioned_on":1483009731,"links":["http:\/\/www.heartandlung.org\/article\/S0147-9563%2815%2900174-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0147956315001740"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.heartandlung.org\/article\/S0147956315001740\/pdf","pmid":"26227332","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"382","subjects":["criticalcare","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Decreasing sedentary behavior by 30 minutes per day reduces cardiovascular disease risk factors in rural Americans","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreasing-sedentary-behavior-30-minutes-per-day-reduces-cardiovascular-disease-risk-factors-rural-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":3942893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3807534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227602,"mean":8.5543067561214,"rank":109650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":108282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227602,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":2.9889520547945,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.2230769230769,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
