Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are the major enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, and many substances are bioactivated by P450s to form active compounds. An example is the conversion of olefinic substrates to epoxides, which are intermediates in the metabolic activation of many known or suspected carcinogens. We have calculated the activation energies for epoxidation by the active species of P450 enzymes (an iron-oxo porphyrin cationradical oxidant, Compound I) for a diverse set of thirty-six olefinic substrates with state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) methods. Activation energies can be estimated by the computationally less demanding method of calculating the ionization potentials of the substrates, which provides a useful and simple predictive model based on the reaction mechanism; however, the pre-classification of these diverse substrates into weakly polar and strongly polar groups is a prerequisite for the construction of specific predictive models with good predictability for P450 epoxidation. This approach has been supported by both internal and external validation. Furthermore, the relation between the activation energies for the regioselective epoxidation and hydroxylation reactions of P450s and experimental data has been investigated. The results show that the computational method used in this work, single-point energy calculations with the B3LYP functional including zero-point-energy, solvation and dispersion corrections based on B3LYP-optimized geometries, performs well in reproducing the experimental trends of the epoxidation and hydroxylation reactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ec","authors":["Jing Zhang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.chemrestox.5b00232","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T13:02:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5010"],"journal":"Chemical Research in Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1438783414,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.chemrestox.5b00232"],"pmid":"26200167","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"In Silico Prediction of Cytochrome P450-Mediated Biotransformations of Xenobiotics: A Case Study of Epoxidation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silico-prediction-cytochrome-p450mediated-biotransformations-xenobiotics-case-study-epoxidation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6302128,"mean":5.8112369579344,"rank":5367108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6302128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192718,"mean":8.9850795415038,"rank":154890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192718,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":622,"mean":4.4583156199678,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":622,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.8125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
