The structural motif of the complexes studied consists of a Cu6 metal core supported by two phosphine ligands and stabilized by \u03c3- and \u03c0-coordination of the alkynyl fragments (together with coordination of pyridine nitrogen atoms in cluster 6). The solid state structures of complexes 2-6 were determined by single crystal XRD analysis. The structures of the complexes in solution were elucidated by (1)H, (31)P, (1)H-(1)H COSY NMR spectroscopy, and ESI mass spectrometry. Clusters 1-6 exhibit moderately strong phosphorescence in the solid state with quantum yields up to 17%. Complexes 1-5 were found to form solvates (acetone, acetonitrile) in the solid state. The coordination of loosely bound solvent molecules strongly affects emission characteristics and leads to solvato- and vapochromic behavior of the clusters. Thus, solvent-free and acetonitrile solvated forms of 3 demonstrate contrasting emission in orange (615 nm) and blue (475 nm) regions, respectively. The computational studies show that alkynyl-centered IL transitions mixed with those of MLCT between the Cu6 metal core and the ligand environment play a dominant role in the formation of excited states and can be considerably modulated by weakly coordinating solvent molecules leading to luminescence vapochromism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Ilya S.
