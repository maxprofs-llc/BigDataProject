Studies in humans have demonstrated transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) after-effects following stimulation durations in the range of minutes. However, such after-effects are absent in animal studies using much shorter stimulation protocols in the range of seconds. Thus, stimulation duration might be a critical parameter for after-effects to occur. To test this hypothesis, we repeated a recent human tACS experiment with a short duration. We applied alpha tACS intermittently for 1 s duration while keeping other parameters identical. The results demonstrate that this very short intermittent protocol did not produce after-effects on amplitude or phase of the electroencephalogram. Since synaptic plasticity has been suggested as a possible mechanism for after-effects, our results indicate that a stimulation duration of 1 s is too short to induce synaptic plasticity. Future studies in animals are required that use extended stimulation durations to reveal the neuronal underpinnings. A better understanding of the mechanisms of tACS after-effects is crucial for potential clinical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0a","authors":["Str\u00fcber, Daniel","Rach, Stefan","Neuling, Toralf","Herrmann, Christoph S."],"doi":"10.3389\/fncel.2015.00311","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T14:55:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5102"],"journal":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1444278243,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncel.2015.00311\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26321912?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26321912?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncel.2015.00311\/pdf","pmid":"26321912","pubdate":"2015-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"On the possible role of stimulation duration for after-effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possible-role-stimulation-duration-aftereffects-transcranial-alternating-current-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242404,"mean":5.954806160706,"rank":2220691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3981774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182886,"mean":9.1950014271265,"rank":66584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":114127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182886,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1139,"mean":3.3954481546573,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1139,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":3.7929333333333,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
