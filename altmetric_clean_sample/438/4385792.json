This technological advance would greatly benefit from the parallel development of dedicated methodologies accounting for the variety of timescales involved in the remote detection of tagged animals related to instrumental, environmental and behavioral events. In this paper we propose a methodological framework for estimating the site fidelity (\"residence times\") of acoustic tagged animals at different timescales, based on the survival analysis of continuous residence times recorded at multiple receivers. Our approach is validated through modeling and applied on two distinct datasets obtained from a small coastal pelagic species (bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus) and a large, offshore pelagic species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares), which show very distinct spatial scales of behavior. The methodological framework proposed herein allows estimating the most appropriate temporal scale for processing passive acoustic telemetry data depending on the scientific question of interest. Our method provides residence times free of the bias inherent to environmental and instrumental noise that can be used to study the small scale behavior of acoustic tagged animals. At larger timescales, it can effectively identify residence times that encompass the diel behavioral excursions of fish out of the acoustic detection range. This study provides a systematic framework for the analysis of passive acoustic telemetry data that can be employed for the comparative study of different species and study sites. The same methodology can be used each time discrete records of animal detections of any nature are employed for estimating the site fidelity of an animal at different timescales.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Manuela Capello","Marianne Robert","Marc Soria","Gael Potin","David Itano","Kim Holland","Jean-Louis Deneubourg","Laurent Dagorn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0134002","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T20:18:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1463487129,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0134002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26261985?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0134002.PDF","pmid":"26261985","pubdate":"2015-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Methodological Framework to Estimate the Site Fidelity of Tagged Animals Using Passive Acoustic Telemetry.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methodological-framework-estimate-site-fidelity-tagged-animals-using-passive-acoustic-telemetry-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":2998005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4689936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226900,"mean":8.5248658213564,"rank":74685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":151013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226900,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109541,"mean":10.264499068834,"rank":40127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":68897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109541,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6179,"mean":9.3821754613144,"rank":2156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6179,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
