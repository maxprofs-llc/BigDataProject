Most episodes are treated with antimicrobials, although evidence supporting bacterial infections is often lacking. The extent to which other interventions are employed in managing suspected infections is unknown.\nTo describe interventions used to manage suspected infections in advanced dementia, and identify factors associated with greater intervention use.\nResidents with advanced dementia who experienced suspected infections in 35 Boston NHs were followed for 12 months. Data describing interventions used in managing each episode were ascertained, including: blood draws, chest radiographs, procurement of urine samples, and hospital transfers. Resident and episode characteristics associated with greater intervention use were identified using mixed model regression.\nA total of 240 residents experienced 496 suspected infections involving the following interventions: any, N=360 (72.6%); hospital transfer, N=51 (10.3%); blood draw, N=215 (43.3%); chest radiograph, N=120 (24.2%); and urine sample, N=222 (44.8%). Factors associated with greater intervention use included: black race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.19, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 - 7.44); no do not hospitalize order (AOR, 1.83, 95% CI, 1.16-2.90); not on hospice (AOR, 5.41, 95% CI, 2.14-13.70); and suspected source being respiratory (AOR, 10.67, 95% CI, 4.99 - 22.80), urine (AOR, 15.79, 95% CI, 7.41- 33.66) or fever of unknown source (AOR, 20.26, 95% CI, 8.42 - 48.73) versus skin\/soft tissue.\nNH residents with advanced dementia frequently experience potentially burdensome interventions when suspected of having an infection. Advance directives to limit such interventions may be appropriate for residents whose goal of care is comfort.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea6","authors":["Yates, Elizabeth","Mitchell, Susan L","Habtemariam, Daniel","Dufour, Alyssa B","Givens, Jane L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpainsymman.2015.06.011","first_seen_on":"2015-08-10T19:19:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6513","08853924"],"journal":"Journal of Pain & Symptom Management","last_mentioned_on":1439234321,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0885392415003322"],"pmid":"26169340","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Interventions Associated with the Management of Suspected Infections in Advanced Dementia ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventions-associated-management-suspected-infections-advanced-dementia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":3850864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":919836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191356,"mean":8.9604454443313,"rank":132313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191356,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":5.4095166340509,"rank":744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":12.165771428571,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
