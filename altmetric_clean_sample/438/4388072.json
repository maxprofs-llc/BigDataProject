Vedotin as 2nd-Line Rx before ASCT in Rel\/Ref #Hodgkin Lymphoma #BBMT #lymsm","Our new data on Brentuximab Vedotin prior to Autologous Transplantation in Relapsed\/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma"],"citation":{"abstract":"This multicenter prospective phase II study examines the activity and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin as second-line therapy in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that was relapsed or refractory after induction therapy. Brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg\/kg) was administered intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for a total of 4 cycles. Patients then proceeded to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT), if eligible, with or without additional salvage therapy, based on remission status post brentuximab vedotin. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were safety, stem cell mobilization\/collection, AHCT outcomes and association of CD68+ with outcomes. Of 37 patients, the ORR was 68% (13 complete remission, 12 partial remission). The regimen was well tolerated with few grade 3\/4 adverse events including lymphopenia (1), neutropenia (3), rash (2), and hyperuricemia (1). Thirty-three (89%) patients were able to proceed to AHCT, with 24 (65%) in CR at time of AHCT. Thirteen patients in CR, 4 in PR and 1 in SD (49%) received AHCT without salvage combination chemotherapy. CD 68 expression did not correlate with response to brentuximab vedotin. The median number of stem cells mobilized was 6.0 x 10(6) (2.6-34) and median number of days to obtain minimum collection (2 x 10(6)) was 2 (1-6). Brentuximab vedotin as second-line therapy is active, well tolerated, and allows adequate stem cell collection and engraftment. For Hodgkin lymphoma patients with relapsed\/refractory disease post-induction therapy, second-line brentuximab vedotin, followed by combination chemotherapy for residual disease, can effectively bridge patients to AHCT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e3","authors":["Chen, Robert","Palmer, Joycelynne M","Martin, Peter","Tsai, Nicole","Kim, Young","Chen, Bihong T","Popplewell, Leslie","Siddiqi, Tanya","Thomas, Sandra H","Mott, Michelle","Sahebi, Firoozeh","Armenian, Saro","Leonard, John","Nademanee, Auayporn","Forman, Stephen J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbmt.2015.07.018","endpage":"2140","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T13:03:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1523-6536","1083-8791","10838791"],"issue":"12","journal":"Biology of Blood & Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1439992343,"links":["http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083-8791%2815%2900495-4\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bbmt.org\/article\/S1083879115004954\/pdf","pmid":"26211987","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2136","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Results of a Multicenter Phase II Trial of Brentuximab Vedotin as Second-Line Therapy before Autologous Transplantation in Relapsed\/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/results-multicenter-phase-ii-trial-brentuximab-vedotin-secondline-therapy-before-autologous-transpla-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561235,"mean":6.0788887803725,"rank":1190203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5366367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561235,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197051,"mean":9.1175950976911,"rank":47738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":149012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197051,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1093,"mean":2.9422637362637,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1093,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":3.2706896551724,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
