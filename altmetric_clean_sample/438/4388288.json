On this basis, an unprecedentedly high-resolution digital image sensor with a pixel size of 50 nm and a resolution of 90 nm is fabricated. The ultrahigh-resolution digital image sensor can heavily impact the field of visual information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Jiang, Chengming","Song, Jinhui"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201502079","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T14:51:54+00:00","issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"30","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1443541619,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201502079","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1002\/adma.201502079"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502079\/pdf","pmid":"26135604","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"An Ultrahigh\u2010Resolution Digital Image Sensor with Pixel Size of 50 nm by Vertical Nanorod Arrays","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrahighresolution-digital-image-sensor-pixel-size-50-nm-vertical-nanorod-arrays"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6415361,"mean":5.8735737183895,"rank":574523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":5816557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6415361,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194350,"mean":9.0293454146922,"rank":28407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":165282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194350,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3659,"mean":9.7023838162931,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3659,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":16.950072072072,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
