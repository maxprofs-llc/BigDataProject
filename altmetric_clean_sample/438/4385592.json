After collecting anthropometric data, body composition was measured by bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). RMR was measured by using indirect calorimetry (FitMate\u2122) and was estimated by 10 commonly used predictive equations. Comparisons were conducted using paired t-test. The accuracy of the RMR equations was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of subjects' predicted RMR within 10% of measured RMR.\nThe mean BMI of subjects was 17.3\u00b11.3 kg\/m(2). The measured RMR ranged 736-1490 kcal\/day (mean 1084.7\u00b1175 kcal\/day). Findings indicated that except Muller and Abbreviation, other equations significantly over estimated RMR, compared to measured value (P<0.05). As an individual prediction accuracy, these predictive equations showed poor performance with the highest accuracy rate of 54.8% for Muller equation (22.1% under and 23.1% over-prediction) and 43.3% for Abbreviation equation (31.7% under and 25% over-prediction), the percentage bias was 1.8% and 0.63% and RMSE was 162 and 173 kcal\/d, respectively.\nAlthough Muller equation gave fairly acceptable prediction, more suitable new equations are needed to be developed to help better management of nutritional plans in young underweight people.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa66a3cf058f610009409","authors":["Aliasgharzadeh, Soghra","Mahdavi, Reza","Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammad","Namazi, Nazli"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T18:31:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2251-6085"],"issue":"6","journal":"Iranian Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1439345420,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26258095"],"pmid":"26258095","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Comparison of Indirect Calorimetry and Predictive Equations in Estimating Resting Metabolic Rate in Underweight Females.","type":"article","volume":"44"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":2885777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2566021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191573,"mean":8.9720413943584,"rank":103265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":87138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191573,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":2.0394947368421,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.147619047619,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aedweb\/status\/631170921563324416","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4385592],"posted_on":"2015-08-11T18:30:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Academy for E.D.","url":"http:\/\/www.aedweb.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/461973850624778240\/8nmMhLTK_normal.jpeg","description":"The Academy for Eating Disorders: A global, professional association committed to leadership in eating disorders research, education, treatment and prevention.","id_on_source":"aedweb","tweeter_id":"21700435","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10229},"tweet_id":"631170921563324416"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/margsala\/status\/631286565386334208","license":"datasift","rt":["aedweb"],"citation_ids":[4385592],"posted_on":"2015-08-12T02:10:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Margaret Sala","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590700419543920640\/hTwLYSDN_normal.jpg","description":"Clinical psychology PhD student @ SMU in Dallas","id_on_source":"margsala","tweeter_id":"140451979","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":95},"tweet_id":"631286565386334208"}]}}
