Chem. Eur. J."],"citation":{"abstract":"The assembly of imidazole-functionalized phenanthroline-strapped zinc porphyrins (ZnPorphen) with alkyl or polyethylene glycol (PEG) side chains was studied in solution and by AFM after casting on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) or mica. The nature of the solvent and its evaporation time influenced the morphology of the objects observed. On HOPG, short rods of about 100\u2005nm were observed after fast evaporation of solutions of the alkyl derivatives in CHCl3 , THF, or pyridine, whereas islands of aligned rows of longer wires were obtained from methylcyclohexane (MCH). Slow evaporation of MCH led to a three-dimensional assembly. The PEG porphyrin assembled into short wires on HOPG or fibers on mica after slow evaporation of solutions in THF. This study shows the role of surface-molecule interactions in the interfacial assembly of ZnPorphen derivatives and contributes to understanding the parameters that control their noncovalent assembly into molecular wires on a surface.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Rauch, Vivien","Kikkawa, Yoshihiro","Koepf, Matthieu","Hijazi, Ismail","Wytko, Jennifer A.","Campidelli, St\u00e9phane","Goujon, Antoine","Kanesato, Masatoshi","Weiss, Jean"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201501767","endpage":"13444","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T12:25:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"38","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1440186874,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201501767&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201501767","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26270238?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201501767\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201501767\/pdf","pmid":"26270238","pubdate":"2015-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"13437","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Trapping Nanostructures on Surfaces through Weak Interactions","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trapping-nanostructures-surfaces-through-weak-interactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6415105,"mean":5.9877480093851,"rank":2630750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3639603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6415105,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190664,"mean":9.1004842785438,"rank":85225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":98815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190664,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3121,"mean":3.5047384615385,"rank":1251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3121,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":2.2527425149701,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
