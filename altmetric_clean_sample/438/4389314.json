The risk factors examined were sucking habits, feeding habits, symptoms of respiratory infections, and antibiotic therapy at the time of sampling. Lactobacilli occurred in 18% of the children's saliva, and Candida in 24%. In the logistic modeling the variables most strongly associated with the occurrence of lactobacilli were pacifier-sucking (relative risk (RR), 2.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-7.0; P = 0.01) and antibiotic therapy (RR, 4.6; CI, 1.2-16.9; P = 0.01). The association between positive Candida test and use of a pacifier was also significant (RR, 4.8; CI, 2.1-10.7; P = 0.0001). The results of the study suggest that the use of a pacifier increases the occurrence of both salivary lactobacilli and Candida. It could therefore be a factor influencing caries susceptibility and activity in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215b","authors":["Ollila, P","Niemel\u00e4, M","Uhari, M","Larmas, M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T18:19:22+00:00","issns":["0001-6357"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Odontologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1439393894,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9083568"],"pmid":"9083568","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Risk factors for colonization of salivary lactobacilli and Candida in children.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-colonization-salivary-lactobacilli-candida-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":714786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4745967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191545,"mean":8.9785238796309,"rank":34022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":157214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191545,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":2.5463671497585,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Is David Beckham right to let his four-year-old daughter use a dummy?","url":"http:\/\/theconversation.com\/is-david-beckham-right-to-let-his-four-year-old-daughter-use-a-dummy-40422","license":"public","citation_ids":[4389312,4389313,4389314,4389315,174658],"posted_on":"2015-08-12T15:38:14+00:00","summary":"The Beckhams are having none of it.
