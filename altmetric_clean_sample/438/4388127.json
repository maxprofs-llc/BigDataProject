Eye pain"],"citation":{"abstract":"The most likely etiology of post-LASIK dry eye is corneal nerve damage; however, no direct relationship between post-LASIK dry eye symptoms and nerve damage has been established, and limited information is available about the relationship between dry eye signs and corneal reinnervation after LASIK. Tear neuropeptides (SP and CGRP) are important in the maintenance of corneal nerve health, but the impact of LASIK has not yet been studied. This study evaluated changes in nerve morphology, tear neuropeptide, and dry eye, so as to establish the relationship between reinnervation and dry eye and to assess the role of tear neuropeptides in reinnervation post-LASIK.\nTwenty non-dry eye volunteers who had undergone bilateral myopic-LASIK completed this study. Corneal nerve morphology (density, width, interconnections, and tortuosity), SP and CGRP concentration, and dry eye were monitored over time prior to, 1\u00a0day, 1\u00a0week, 1, 3, and 6\u00a0months post-LASIK.\nDry eye symptoms and tear function, except for osmolarity (P\u2009=\u20090.003), remained unchanged post-LASIK. Corneal nerve morphology decreased immediately, and did not return to preoperative levels by 6\u00a0months post-LASIK (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Increased tear SP concentration was observed 3\u00a0months post-LASIK (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Associations between reinnervation as measured by increased density and lower tear SP (P\u2009=\u20090.03), and between increased density and decreased dry eye symptoms (P\u2009=\u20090.01) were found post-LASIK.\nAn inverse relationship between reinnervation post-LASIK and dry eye symptoms was found, confirming that post-LASIK dry eye is a neuropathic disease. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between tear SP and post-LASIK reinnervation, suggesting that strategies for manipulating neuropeptide concentration to improve reinnervation may improve ocular comfort post-LASIK.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Chao, Cecilia","Stapleton, Fiona","Zhou, Xiangtian","Chen, Shihao","Zhou, Shi","Golebiowski, Blanka","Cecilia Chao","Fiona Stapleton","Xiangtian Zhou","Shihao Chen","Shi Zhou","Blanka Golebiowski"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00417-015-3120-1","endpage":"2039","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T13:15:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-702X","0721-832X"],"issue":"11","journal":"Graefe's Archive of Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1448282935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26259635"],"pmid":"26259635","pubdate":"2015-08-12T22:01:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"2029","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Structural and functional changes in corneal innervation after laser in situ keratomileusis and their relationship with dry eye.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00417-015-3120-1","volume":"253","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-functional-changes-corneal-innervation-after-laser-situ-keratomileusis-relationship-dry-e-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6597995,"mean":6.1232477659116,"rank":1240240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5351384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6597995,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197484,"mean":9.1201334089518,"rank":49908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":147292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197484,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":591,"mean":1.4740305084746,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":591,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
