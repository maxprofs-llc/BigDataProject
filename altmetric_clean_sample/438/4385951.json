Fixation behavior, location and stability of preferred retinal locus, eye movement speed, and mean sensitivity were assessed. The mean retinal sensitivities before, after and at 1-year after training in the right eye were 2.9 dB, 2.9 dB and 3.7 dB and in the left eye were 3.5 dB, 3.7 dB and 1.8 dB. The fixation point in the 2\u00b0 gravitation circle, improved from 40% to 50% in the right eye and from 43% to 67% in the left eye. The average eye speed before, after and at 1-year after training in right eye were 0.19\u00b0\/s, 0.26\u00b0\/s and 0.25\u00b0\/s and in left eye were 0.36\u00b0\/s, 0.25\u00b0\/s and 0.27\u00b0\/s. Thus, biofeedback training using MP-1 can improve the visual function in patients with macular diseases and central scotoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaf","authors":["Raman","Rajiv Raman","Deepali Damkondwar","Srividya Neriyanuri","Tarun Sharma"],"doi":"10.4103\/0301-4738.162609","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T23:01:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-3689"],"issue":"6","journal":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1439334046,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/text.asp?2015\/63\/6\/534\/162609"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijo.in\/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2015;volume=63;issue=6;spage=534;epage=536;aulast=Raman;type=2","pmid":"26265646","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Microperimetry biofeedback training in a patient with bilateral myopic macular degeneration with central scotoma","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microperimetry-biofeedback-training-patient-bilateral-myopic-macular-degeneration-central-scotoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":4552604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191538,"mean":8.9710352151283,"rank":153552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191538,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":0.95260869565217,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":0.4015873015873,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
