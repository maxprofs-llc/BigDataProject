In the present study, we developed a novel cell-based vaccine, Meso-VAX, to generate mesothelin antigen-specific immune responses and immunotherapy against ovarian cancer. Mesothelin, a secreted protein anchored at the cell membrane has recently been identified as a potential new tumor antigen for ovarian cancer. In this study, mice vaccinated with Meso-VAX and AAV-IL-12 exhibited dramatic increases in the number of mesothelin-specific CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell precursors, higher titers of anti-mesothelin Abs, and in vitro tumor killing activity, and all of these mice were tumor-free after 60 days of tumor challenge. In addition, a significant reduction in peritoneal tumors and longer survival were noted in the mice vaccinated with Meso-VAX combined with AAV-IL-12. CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes were essential for the anti-tumor effect generated by Meso-VAX combined with AAV-IL-12. The post-vaccination sera of the mice vaccinated with Meso-VAX and AAV-IL-12 also showed mesothelin-specific complement-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that a Meso-VAX cell-based vaccine combined with AAV-IL-12 can generate antigen-specific immunological responses and anti-tumor effects on ovarian cancer.Gene Therapy accepted article preview online, 11 August 2015. doi:10.1038\/gt.2015.85.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002934","authors":["Chang, M-C","Chen, Y-L","Chiang, Y-C","Chen, T-C","Tang, Y-C","Chen, C-A","Sun, W-Z","Cheng, W-F"],"doi":"10.1038\/gt.2015.85","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T11:05:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5462"],"journal":"Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1439377533,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26262583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26262583","pubdate":"2015-08-12T22:00:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Mesothelin-specific cell-based vaccine generates antigen-specific immunity and potent anti-tumor effects by combining with IL-12 Immunomodulator.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mesothelinspecific-cellbased-vaccine-generates-antigenspecific-immunity-potent-antitumor-effects-com"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476686,"mean":6.3617939567448,"rank":4556060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476686,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191542,"mean":8.978682517059,"rank":153483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191542,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":570,"mean":6.8428435852373,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":570,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":8.7206060606061,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/631421257888587776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4387493],"posted_on":"2015-08-12T11:05:33+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
