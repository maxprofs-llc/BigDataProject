Recently, we described a novel ion-activation approach based on combining collision- with ozone-induced dissociation (CID\/OzID) for the identification of the relative acyl chain substitution positions in glycerophospholipids. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that CID\/OzID can be effectively combined with reversed-phase chromatography to enable the separation and unambiguous identification of regioisomeric pairs of phosphatidylcholines that differ only in the arrangement of acyl chains on the glycerol backbone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000735b","authors":["Blanksby, Stephen","Mitchell, Todd","Kozlowskia, Rachel","Stephen Blanksby","Todd Mitchell","Rachel Kozlowskia"],"doi":"10.1255\/ejms.1300","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T01:05:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-0667","1356-1049"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1440787667,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1255\/ejms.1300","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26307699?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"\/\/www.impublications.com\/subs\/ejms\/v21\/E21_0191.pdf","pmid":"26307699","pubdate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"191","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Separation and identification of phosphatidylcholine regioisomers by combining liquid chromatography with a fusion of collision-and ozone-induced dissociation.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.impublications.com\/content\/abstract?code=E21_0191","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/separation-identification-phosphatidylcholine-regioisomers-combining-liquid-chromatography-fusion-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560729,"mean":6.3849504158434,"rank":3921113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":930506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560729,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192322,"mean":8.9939916285794,"rank":132955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192322,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190,"mean":1.3000317460317,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.3690476190476,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
