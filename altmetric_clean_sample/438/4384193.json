Subcutaneous xenograft models are widely used in the past decades. Yet, with the advent of in vivo imaging technology, investigators are more and more concerned with the orthotopic models nowadays. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEM) have greatly facilitated studies of gene function in HCC development. Recently, GEM of miR-122 and miR-221 provided new approaches for better understanding of the in vivo functions of microRNA in hepatocarcinogenesis. Chemically induced liver tumors in animals share many of the morphological, histogenic, and biochemical features of human HCC. Yet, the complicated and obscure genomic alternation restricts their applications. In this review, we highlight both the frequently used mouse models and some emerging ones with emphasis on their merits or defects, and give advises for investigators to chose a \"best-fit\" animal model in HCC research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["He, Li","Tian, De-An","Li, Pei-Yuan","He, Xing-Xing"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.4202","first_seen_on":"2015-08-11T11:13:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"27","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1439291584,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26259234?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4695120","pmid":"26259234","pubdate":"2015-08-11T22:00:07+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Mouse models of liver cancer: Progress and recommendations.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mouse-models-liver-cancer-progress-recommendations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":4552611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191537,"mean":8.9710071318187,"rank":153554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191537,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5065,"mean":1.7839091627172,"rank":3090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5065,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":2.0374930693069,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
