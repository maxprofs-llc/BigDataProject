During an oesophagectomy, the azygos vein typically is transected as a requirement of the surgery. In this case, the enlarged azygos and its arch were a continuation of the IVC. During our procedure, we first established a bypass between the right femoral vein and the jugular vein in case of injury to the azygos vein, and we then performed a McKeown oesophagectomy without transecting the azygos vein. Our experience suggests that an oesophagectomy in cases with an azygos vein continuation of the IVC is feasible. An adequate medical examination and careful reading of the imaging is crucial for the safety of these surgical procedures. An appropriate surgical approach should be selected according to the location of the tumour, the size of the tumour and its anatomical features. The establishment of a veno-venous bypass and protection of the azygos arch in patients whose azygos vein is a continuation of IVC is necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","authors":["Yi Shen","Xiang Zhuang","Ping Xiao","Wei Dai","Qiang Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12957-015-0625-3","first_seen_on":"2015-08-12T11:33:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-7819"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1439379205,"links":["http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/13\/1\/242\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/pdf\/s12957-015-0625-3.pdf","pmid":"26264228","pubdate":"2015-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Oesophagectomy in a patient with azygos vein continuation of the inferior vena cava: report of a case","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oesophagectomy-patient-azygos-vein-continuation-inferior-vena-cava-report-case"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476876,"mean":6.3619433143891,"rank":3854217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":920700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476876,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191544,"mean":8.9785417791306,"rank":132254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191544,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1151,"mean":1.2927652173913,"rank":563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1151,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":0.95593220338983,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Cancer411Today\/statuses\/631428270907523072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4387645],"posted_on":"2015-08-12T11:33:25+00:00","author":{"name":"\u25c8 Cory B.
