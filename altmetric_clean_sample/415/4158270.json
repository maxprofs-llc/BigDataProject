Accumulating evidence demonstrates that mammalian cortical reaction is probably mediated by activation of the inositol phosphate (PIP(2)) cascade. The sperm-egg fusion, mediated by GTP-binding protein (G-protein), may elicit the generation of two second messengers, inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The former induces Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores and the latter activates protein kinase C (PKC), leading to CG exocytosis. Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) may act as a switch in the transduction of the calcium signal. The CG exudates cause zona sperm receptor modification and zona hardening, and thus block polyspermic penetration. Oolemma modification after sperm-egg fusion and formation of CG envelope following cortical reaction also contribute to polyspermy block.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008193","authors":["Sun, Qing-Yuan"],"doi":"10.1002\/jemt.10347","first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T05:59:43+00:00","issns":["1059-910X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Microscopy Research and Technique","last_mentioned_on":1426655882,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12811739"],"pmid":"12811739","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Health Professions","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to cortical reaction and polyspermy block in mammalian eggs.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-molecular-mechanisms-leading-cortical-reaction-polyspermy-block-mammalian-eggs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888304,"mean":5.8155820430968,"rank":1194974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3101111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888304,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170113,"mean":8.4397235115691,"rank":53535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":113390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170113,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":309,"mean":1.5926688311688,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":309,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.65625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
