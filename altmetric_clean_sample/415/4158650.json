Two of the strains formed a separate subgroup on the basis of both their protein contents and their fatty acid contents. However, the overall protein and fatty acid profiles revealed that all 10 strains were highly related. Representative strains of the two subgroups exhibited high DNA binding values (98%) with each other and had an identical DNA base ratio (44 mol% G+C). DNA-rRNA hybridizations revealed that this taxon can be included in the genus Moraxella, which is only distantly related to phenotypically similar genera, such as the genera Neisseria and Kingella. The results of an extensive phenotypic analysis indicated that the general biochemical profile of the 10 strains conforms with the description of the genus Moraxella given in Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. We therefore consider these organisms members of a new Moraxella species, for which the name Moraxella lincolnii is proposed. Furthermore, we also conclude that Moraxella osloensis belongs, genotypically as well as phenotypically, to the genus Moraxella.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fc","authors":["Vandamme, P","Gillis, M","Vancanneyt, M","Hoste, B","Kersters, K","Falsen, E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T07:10:01+00:00","issns":["0020-7713"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1465213595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8347507"],"pmid":"8347507","pubdate":"1993-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Moraxella lincolnii sp. nov., isolated from the human respiratory tract, and reevaluation of the taxonomic position of Moraxella osloensis.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moraxella-lincolnii-sp-nov-isolated-human-respiratory-tract-reevaluation-taxonomic-position-moraxell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":1930953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4846141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220563,"mean":8.2066733798207,"rank":66399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":149166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220563,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":3.2795694716243,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.6,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Moraxella lincolnii","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=593251334#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[4158650],"posted_on":"2014-01-31T08:54:05+00:00","summary":"Moraxella lincolnii is a gram negative bacterium from the genus of Moraxella which was isolated from the human respiratory tract.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=41797894","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Daniel-Brown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Daniel-Brown"}},{"title":"Moraxella osloensis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=723977090#altmetric_citation_1c1a12a0-e01b-4982-8dbe-c076c4133295","license":"public","citation_ids":[8510161,4158650],"posted_on":"2016-06-06T11:46:35+00:00","summary":"Moraxella osloensis is a species of Gram-negative oxidase positive, aerobic bacteria within the family Moraxellaceae in the gamma subdivision of the purple bacteria.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=26768312","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Chris Capoccia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Chris Capoccia"}}]}}
