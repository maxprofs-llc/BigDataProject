Recently, we reported two novel cDNAs encoding adhesion molecules, NB-2 and NB-3, in the contactin\/F3 subgroup of the immunoglobulin superfamily from rat brain. We have now isolated cDNA encoding human NB-3. The cDNA clone, hNB-3, consists of 3,530 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 3,084 nucleotides encoding 1,028 amino acids. It shares with rat NB-3 86% identity in nucleotide sequences and 90% identity in amino acid sequences. Likewise, hNB-3 exhibits 53% and 51% identity in nucleotide sequences and 43% and 44% identity in amino acid sequences with human contactin\/F3 and human TAG-1\/axonin-1, respectively. Northern blot analysis of mRNA isolated from different regions of the adult human nervous system showed that the hNB-3 mRNA content was regionally different by dozens-fold, although the mRNA was detected in all regions, as a transcript of 3.7 kb. The cerebellum showed the highest expression of hNB-3 mRNA among various regions of the nervous system. Chromosomal localization of hNB-3, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, was assigned to 3p25-26.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d97","authors":["Kamei, Y","Tsutsumi, O","Taketani, Y","Watanabe, K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T03:40:53+00:00","issns":["0360-4012"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1344546044,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9486763"],"pmid":"9486763","pubdate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"cDNA cloning and chromosomal localization of neural adhesion molecule NB-3 in human.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cdna-cloning-chromosomal-localization-neural-adhesion-molecule-nb3-human"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4012938,"mean":5.0323237266256,"rank":920876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2534839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4012938,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111518,"mean":6.8118056930695,"rank":30866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":77798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111518,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":596,"mean":2.0784168067227,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":596,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8970588235294,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
