These proteins are expressed and finely regulated in human endometrium during the menstrual cycle, which is consistent with their effects on endometrial cell proliferation and tissue remodeling. This review is focused on summarizing the role of key members of the TGF\u03b2 superfamily in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Evidence suggests that TGF\u03b2, activins, inhibins, nodal, bone morphogenetic proteins, growth differentiation factors, and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone are produced by endometriotic lesions and could be involved in the establishment and progression of the disease. Their receptors and signaling pathways may also be altered in the presence of endometriosis and may be potential targets to the development of therapeutic agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003cff","authors":["Dela Cruz, Cynthia","Reis, Fernando M"],"doi":"10.3109\/09513590.2015.1018166","endpage":"515","first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T16:13:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-0766","0951-3590"],"issue":"7","journal":"Gynecological Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1479968155,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2015.1018166?ai=1lij&mi=3gfofr&af=R&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed&","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/09513590.2015.1018166","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25986305"],"pmid":"25986305","pubdate":"2015-05-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"511","subjects":["endocrinology","gynecology"],"title":"The role of TGF\u03b2 superfamily members in the pathophysiology of endometriosis","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-tgf%CE%B2-superfamily-members-pathophysiology-endometriosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7737442,"mean":6.6309810015932,"rank":3355345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4295336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7737442,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220172,"mean":8.208114202143,"rank":89803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":127761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220172,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":2.0514353312303,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1772727272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
