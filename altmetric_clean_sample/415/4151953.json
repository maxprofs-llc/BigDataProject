Acting out is part and parcel of early development, and as such it is a normal phenomenon, which precedes the development of language, and of reality-oriented action and activity. Later on, it may instead establish itself as a defense, which is usually self-oriented, magic, and omnipotent. Defensive acting out seems linked to pathology in the primitive non-integrated organization of the mind, which may be able not only to prevent early ego development towards reality and object relationship, but to compel the ego to put its developing capacities in the service of the self's needs--above all, the need to survive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079a0","authors":["Gaddini, E"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T08:42:39+00:00","issns":["0020-7578"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Psychoanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1367414115,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7076399"],"pmid":"7076399","pubdate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Acting out in the psychoanalytic session.","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acting-psychoanalytic-session"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4417810,"mean":4.8211342378733,"rank":981980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2864503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4417810,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160380,"mean":6.7191473696682,"rank":43423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":113988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160380,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":2.0635492063492,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.637962962963,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
