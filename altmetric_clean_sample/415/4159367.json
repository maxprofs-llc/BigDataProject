We recently synthesized a tetravalent guanylhydrazone compound (CNI-1493) that inhibits cytokine-inducible arginine transport and nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages, and protects mice against lethal endotoxemia and carrageenan-induced inflammation. During these investigations we noticed that CNI-1493 effectively prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production, even when added in concentrations 10-fold less than required to competitively inhibit L-arginine uptake, suggesting that the suppressive effects of this guanylhydrazone compound might extend to other LPS-induced responses. Here, we report that CNI-1493 suppressed the LPS-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukins 1beta and 6, macrophage inflammatory proteins 1alpha and 1beta) from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cytokine suppression was specific, in that CNI-1493 did not inhibit either the constitutive synthesis of transforming growth factor beta or the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast to the macrophage suppressive actions of dexamethasone, which are overridden in the presence of IFN-gamma, CNI-1493 retained its suppressive effects even in the presence of IFN-gamma. The mechanism of cytokine-suppressive action by CNI-1493 was independent of extracellular L-arginine content and NO production and is not restricted to induction by LPS. As a selective inhibitor of macrophage activation that prevents TNF production, this tetravalent guanylhydrazone could be useful in the development of cytokine-suppressive agents for the treatment of diseases mediated by overproduction of cytokines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Bianchi, M","Bloom, O","Raabe, T","Cohen, P S","Chesney, J","Sherry, B","Schmidtmayerova, H","Calandra, T","Zhang, X","Bukrinsky, M","Ulrich, P","Cerami, A","Tracey, K J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T09:18:07+00:00","issns":["0022-1007"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1241839756,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8642296"],"pmcid":"PMC2192362","pmid":"8642296","pubdate":"1996-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Suppression of proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes by a tetravalent guanylhydrazone.","type":"article","volume":"183","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/suppression-proinflammatory-cytokines-monocytes-tetravalent-guanylhydrazone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999641,"mean":5.0355594219728,"rank":918696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2530750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999641,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106936,"mean":6.7602725095877,"rank":29475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":74747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106936,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2842,"mean":3.6433058782119,"rank":522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2842,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":9.6650344827586,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
