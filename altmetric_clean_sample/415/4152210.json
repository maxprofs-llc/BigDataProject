The corticosteroids are a class of substances that include steroid hormones naturally produced in the adrenal cortex of vertebrates and analogues of these hormones that are synthesized in industry. They are involved in a wide range of physiological processes including stress and immune responses, and the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, sodium homeostasis, and inflammation. These substances are potential environmental contaminants because they are clinically consumed in large amounts worldwide. To develop a simple and sensitive bioassay to detect corticosteroids, we newly established reporter assay yeasts expressing human GR and MR.\nLigand responses of the established assay yeasts were improved by forced expression of a human transcription coactivator SRC-1e. Further enhancement of the responses was achieved by inactivating the CWP and PDR genes that encode cell wall mannoproteins and plasma membrane efflux pumps, respectively, which may be attributable to an increased intracellular concentration of ligands.\nThese new assay yeasts were more responsive to both natural and synthetic agonist ligands than the conventional assay yeasts. They detected both agonistic and antagonistic activities of mifepristone, spironolactone, and eplerenone in a receptor-selective manner. They also detected ligand activities contained in oral pharmaceutical tablets and human urine.\nThis assay system will be a valuable tool to detect agonists as well as antagonists of corticosteroid receptors, in the fields of drug discovery and the assessment of environmental pollutants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb8","authors":["Ito-Harashima, Sayoko","Shiizaki, Kazuhiro","Kawanishi, Masanobu","Kakiuchi, Koji","Onishi, Kana","Yamaji, Ryoichi","Yagi, Takashi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vascn.2015.06.001","first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T10:00:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-488X"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmacological & Toxicological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1434293888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26070404?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26070404","pubdate":"2015-06-14T22:02:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Construction of sensitive reporter assay yeasts for comprehensive detection of ligand activities of human corticosteroid receptors through inactivation of CWP and PDR genes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/construction-sensitive-reporter-assay-yeasts-comprehensive-detection-ligand-activities-human-cortico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5229325,"mean":6.1628027251727,"rank":2590350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2482005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5229325,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178038,"mean":8.6217568482957,"rank":90508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":79748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178038,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.7493392857143,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BE":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/evomorph_papers\/status\/610023892254470144","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4152210],"posted_on":"2015-06-14T10:00:04+00:00","author":{"name":"evomorphpapers","url":"http:\/\/www.fun-morph.ugent.be","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509235643382120448\/dAXX0NaY_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers dealing with Evolutionary Morphology of Vertebrates","id_on_source":"evomorph_papers","tweeter_id":"2799364100","geo":{"lt":51.05,"ln":3.71667,"country":"BE"},"followers":13},"tweet_id":"610023892254470144"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/610098905246609409","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4152210],"posted_on":"2015-06-14T14:58:08+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
