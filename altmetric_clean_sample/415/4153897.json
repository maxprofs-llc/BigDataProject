The two decisive factors in PVSRIPO anti-tumor efficacy are selective cytotoxicity and its in situ immunogenic imprint. While our work is focused on what constitutes PVSRIPO cancer cytotoxicity, we are also studying how this engenders host immune responses that are vital to tumor regression. We hypothesize that PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are inextricably linked in essential, complimentary roles that define the anti-neoplastic response. Herein we delineate mechanisms we unraveled to decipher the basis for PVSRIPO cytotoxicity and its immunotherapeutic potential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007078","authors":["Brown, Michael C","Gromeier, Matthias","Michael C Brown","Matthias Gromeier"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.coviro.2015.05.007","endpage":"85","first_seen_on":"2015-06-14T15:31:08+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["18796257","1879-6265"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Virology","last_mentioned_on":1434295810,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1879625715000784"],"pmid":"26083317","pubdate":"2015-06-18T22:01:21+00:00","startpage":"81","title":"Cytotoxic and immunogenic mechanisms of recombinant oncolytic poliovirus ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1879625715000784","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytotoxic-immunogenic-mechanisms-recombinant-oncolytic-poliovirus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5226211,"mean":6.1591234493091,"rank":3677324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":876117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5226211,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178001,"mean":8.6195134269665,"rank":125492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178001,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.2096744186047,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.885,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
