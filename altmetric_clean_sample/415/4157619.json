The objectives were to enhance case reporting and link case reports to preventive interventions.\nElements from surveillance of communicable diseases and sentinel health events were used to integrate a model into the preexisting system in one agricultural country.\nBetween 1988 and 1991, 45 Fresno County health care providers reported 230 suspected cases, of which 217 from 80 work sites met reporting guidelines. Risk factors were profiled from interviews of 81 prioritized case patients and 36 employers. Fifteen work sites were visited and 117 recommendations were made, of which 6% were identified in enforcement inspections. Pest management experts consulted with growers on reducing future pesticide use.\nRisk factors for pesticide illness were prevalent. Agricultural inspectors did not detect routine and serious hazards. Integrated pest management should be expanded and linked to occupational health. Agricultural enforcement personnel should be oriented and trained in occupational safety and health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Maizlish, N","Rudolph, L","Dervin, K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T04:03:07+00:00","issns":["0090-0036"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1258476928,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7762714"],"pmcid":"PMC1615484","pmid":"7762714","pubdate":"1995-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The surveillance of work-related pesticide illness: an application of the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surveillance-workrelated-pesticide-illness-application-sentinel-event-notification-system-occupation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999641,"mean":5.0355594219728,"rank":918722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2530816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999641,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106966,"mean":6.7608507948384,"rank":29485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":74764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106966,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3908,"mean":9.7601490778689,"rank":1532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3908,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":20.3575,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
