While in vitro studies indicate that Tgs1 functions as a monomer and the dimethylation of m(7)G caps is not a processive reaction, partially methylated sn(o)RNAs are typically not detected in living cells. Here we show that both yeast and human Tgs1p possess a conserved self-association property located at the N-terminus. A disruption of Tgs1 self-association led to a strong reduction of sn(o)RNA trimethylation as well as reduced nucleolar enrichment of Tgs1. Self-association of Tgs1p and its catalytic activity were also prerequisite to bypass the requirement for its accessory factor Swm2p for efficient pre-rRNA processing and snRNA trimethylation. The ability to self-associate might enable Tgs1 to efficiently dimethylate the caps of the targeted RNAs in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kum-Loong Boon","Kum-Loong Boon","Michael David Pearson","Martin Ko\u0161"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep11282","first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T11:57:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1434453787,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep11282","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26074133?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26074133","pubdate":"2015-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Small RNAs","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"RNA modification","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"RNA","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Self-association of Trimethylguanosine Synthase Tgs1 is required for efficient snRNA\/snoRNA trimethylation and pre-rRNA processing.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfassociation-trimethylguanosine-synthase-tgs1-required-efficient-snrnasnorna-trimethylation-prerr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228922,"mean":6.1649666082185,"rank":3677324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":877962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228922,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178073,"mean":8.5752263129522,"rank":125404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":33414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178073,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17515,"mean":13.552211716341,"rank":12760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":2809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17515,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1614,"mean":10.759587104774,"rank":1188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1614,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
