Cationic [Au(I)-L1][SbF6] complex is more active catalyst compared to neutral L2 and L3- Au(I)- [bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate] complexes (L1, L2 = Buchwald-type biaryl phosphane and L3 = triphenylphosphine) to promote the double A3- coupling of ethynyltrimethylsilane, secondary amine (cyclic, aliphatic or aromatic) and formaldehyde. The solvent influences the catalytic performance by desilylation of silyl acetylene or deactivation of catalyst by halogen atom. Acetylide bridged cationic digold(I)-L1 and -L2 complexes have been isolated and characterized by single crystal XRD and their spectroscopic properties. Iodine in the acetylene reagent deactivates the Au(I) catalyst by formation the less active iodide-bridged cationic digold(I)-L1 complex that was fully characterized by single crystal XRD and spectroscopic properties. Also it was observed that the nature of the phosphine ligand of the gold complexes used as catalyst affects the stability and activity of the formed cationic ethynyl-bridged di-Au(I)-L intermediates whose isolation lends support to the proposed double A3-coupling mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Grirrane, Abdessamad","\u00c1lvarez, Eleuterio","Garc\u00eda, Hermenegildo","Corma, Avelino"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201605269","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T15:08:04+00:00","issns":["09476539","1521-3765"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1485961642,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605269\/abstract;jsessionid=DF398F5DBE2C40C3204E510D317EF6AC.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605269\/pdf","pmid":"28009064","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Preparation of Tremorine and Gemini Surfactant Precursors using Cationic Ethynyl-Bridged Digold Catalysts","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/chem.201605269","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparation-tremorine-gemini-surfactant-precursors-cationic-ethynylbridged-digold-catalysts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":7066953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262743,"mean":12.854591934293,"rank":217688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262743,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5998,"mean":3.1114003668501,"rank":4330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5998,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":600,"mean":3.5310150250417,"rank":397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":600,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
