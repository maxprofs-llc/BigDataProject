Crystallin growth is under a combination of genes and their products in time and space to complete the coordination role of the guidance. Congenital cataract-related genes, included crystallin protein gene (CRYAA, CRYAB, CRYBA1\/A3, CRYBA4, CRYBB1, CRYBB2, CRYBB3, CRYGC, CRYGD, CRYGS), gap junction channel protein gene (GJA1, GJA3, GJA8), membrane protein gene (GJA3, GJA8, MIP, LIM2), cytoskeletal protein gene (BF-SP2), transcription factor genes (HSF4, MAF, PITX3, PAX6), ferritin light chain gene (FTL), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and so on. Currently, there are about 39 genetic loci isolated to which primary cataracts have been mapped, although the number is constantly increasing and depends to some extent on definition. We summarized the recent advances on epidemiology and genetic locations of congenital cataract in this review.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef752a83ee09648b51cd","authors":["Jun Yi","Jun Yun","Zhi-Kui Li","Chang-Tai Xu","Bo-Rong Pan"],"doi":"10.3980\/j.issn.2222-3959.2011.04.20","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T16:10:01+00:00","issns":["2227-4898"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1485957600,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3340856\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3340856","pmid":"22553694","pubdate":"2017-02-01T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"Press of International Journal of Ophthalmology","startpage":"422","title":"Epidemiology and molecular genetics of congenital cataracts.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-molecular-genetics-congenital-cataracts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":1169169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6918088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262743,"mean":12.854568717601,"rank":57400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":201872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262743,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":1.5312834224599,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.90714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
