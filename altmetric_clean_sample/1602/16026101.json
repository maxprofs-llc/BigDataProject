More than fifty experts from the global influenza vaccine research and development field met to initiate such discussion at a workshop co-organised by EDUFLUVAC consortium, a European Union funded project coordinated by the European Vaccine Initiative, and the National Institutes of Health \/ National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, USA. The workshop audience agreed that it was not possible to establish a single immunoassay for \"universal\" influenza vaccines because the current approaches differ in the vaccines' nature and immunogenicity properties. Therefore, different scientific rationales for the immunoassay selection are required. In order to avoid dilution of efforts, the choice of the primary evaluation criteria (e.g. serological assays or T cell assays) should drive the effort of harmonisation. However, at an early phase of clinical development, more efforts on exploratory assessments should be undertaken to better define the immune profile in response to immunisation with new vaccines. The workshop concluded that each laboratory should aim towards validation of the appropriate immunoassays used during the entire process of vaccine development from antigen discovery up to establishment of correlates of protection, including the different steps of quality control (e.g. potency assays), animal studies and human clinical development. Standardisation of the immunoassays is the ultimate goal and there is a long way to go. This article is protected by copyright.
