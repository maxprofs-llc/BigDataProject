Relevant data were collected using a maternal self-design questionnaire. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS.\nUnivariate analysis has yielded 20 significant risk factors for CP. Advanced maternal age (30 years or older) at childbirth (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-2.72), alcohol consumption during pregnancy (adjusted OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.23-14.08), living in the countryside (adjusted OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.18-2.48), father's occupational exposure to harmful substances (adjusted OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.61-6.93) and multiple births (adjusted OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.65-5.84) were found to be risk factors for CP by multivariate analysis. On the other side, high mother's education level (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.76), folic acid supplements (adjusted OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.82), and high birth hospital level (adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52-0.90) were found to be protective factors.\nAlthough the important risk factors of CP focus on gestation at birth and perinatal events, the incidence could probably be further lowered, if potential risk factors identified in this study are considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea5","authors":["Gao, Jing","Zhao, Bin","He, Luna","Sun, Meiling","Yu, Xuefeng","Wang, Lina"],"doi":"10.1111\/jpc.13479","endpage":"469","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T12:54:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1034-4810","1440-1754","10344810"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Paediatrics & Child Health","last_mentioned_on":1497665225,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jpc.13479&utm_content=buffer21ae5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13479\/abstract;jsessionid=B48532D4D5D51761F98E4C60267627D9.f04t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13479\/full?utm_content=buffer6cbdf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13479\/full?utm_content=buffer27fcf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13479\/pdf","pmid":"28134474","pubdate":"2017-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"464","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Risk of cerebral palsy in Chinese children: A N:M matched case control study","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-cerebral-palsy-chinese-children-nm-matched-case-control-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6064284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2021732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278559,"mean":12.609881482491,"rank":185266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":78719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278559,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1467,"mean":4.4026862210096,"rank":1071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1467,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":5.287358490566,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Risk of cerebral palsy in Chinese children: A N:M matched case control study","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=610669032455593&id=189335951255572","license":"public","citation_ids":[16021396],"posted_on":"2017-02-01T12:31:05+00:00","summary":"Interesting targets for intervention...","author":{"name":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/189335951255572","facebook_wall_name":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/189335951255572\/picture","id_on_source":"189335951255572"}},{"title":"Risk of cerebral palsy in Chinese children: A N:M matched case control study","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=674439822745180&id=189335951255572","license":"public","citation_ids":[16021396],"posted_on":"2017-06-17T02:07:05+00:00","summary":"Risk of cerebral palsy in Chinese children: A N:M matched case control study","author":{"name":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/189335951255572","facebook_wall_name":"Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/189335951255572\/picture","id_on_source":"189335951255572"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JPCHonline\/statuses\/826914029654401025","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16021396],"posted_on":"2017-02-01T22:04:02+00:00","author":{"name":"JPCH","url":"http:\/\/jpchonline.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485387771851190272\/Scxyy6cH_normal.png","description":"The Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health.
