Incident non-spine fractures were identified in 381 Black, 192 Hispanic, 112 Asian, and 46 Native American women over an average of 8.6 years. A random sample of 400 White women who experienced an incident fracture was chosen. One control was selected per case and matched on age, race\/ethnicity, and blood draw date. Bioavailable estradiol (BioE2), testosterone (BioT) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured using baseline fasting serum. Conditional logistic regression models calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of fracture across tertiles of hormone.\nIn multivariable and race\/ethnicity adjusted models, higher BioE2 (>8.25 pg\/ml) and higher BioT (>13.3 pg\/ml) were associated with decreased risk of fracture, OR=0.65 (0.50-0.85), p trend=0.001 and OR=0.76 (0.60-0.96), p trend=0.02, respectively. The interaction term between race\/ethnicity and either BioE2 or BioT was not significant. There was no association between SHBG and fracture risk. In models stratifying by race\/ethnicity, higher BioE2 was associated with a lower risk of fracture in both White women, OR=0.56 (0.36-0.87) and Black women, OR=0.61 (0.39, 0.96). Higher BioT was associated with a significantly lower fracture risk in only Black women, OR=0.65 (0.43-0.97).\nSerum BioE2 and BioT are associated with fracture risk in older women irrespective of race\/ethnicity, independent of established risk factors for fracture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Cauley, Jane A.","Danielson, Michelle E.","Jammy, Guru Rajesh","Bauer, Doug C.","Jackson, Rebecca","Wactawski-Wende, Jean","Chlebowski, Rowan T.","Ensrud, Kristine E.","Boudreau, Robert"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2016-3589","first_seen_on":"2017-02-01T16:40:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1487197110,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article\/2954929\/Sex-Steroid-Hormones-and-Fracture-in-a-Multi?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article\/2954929\/Sex-Steroid-Hormones-and-Fracture-in-a-Multi"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1210\/jc.2016-3589\/9951570\/jc.2016-3589.pdf","pmid":"28324031","pubdate":"2017-03-23T22:12:45+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Sex Steroid Hormones and Fracture in a Multi-ethnic Cohort of Women: The Women\u2019s Health Initiative Study (WHI).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sex-steroid-hormones-fracture-multiethnic-cohort-women-womens-health-initiative-study-whi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":893891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7307542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266138,"mean":12.832050710724,"rank":45062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":220505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266138,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6980,"mean":8.4700702106319,"rank":900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6980,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":29.965217391304,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Drlipid\/statuses\/826832535262986241","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16028727],"posted_on":"2017-02-01T16:40:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Thomas Dayspring","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/662252523\/Picture_2009_normal.jpg","description":"MD, FACP, FNLA, NCMP - Chief Academic Officer True Health Diagnostics Tweets\/Re-Tweets do not represent endorsements\/medical advice","id_on_source":"Drlipid","tweeter_id":"56916619","geo":{"lt":37.55376,"ln":-77.46026,"country":"US"},"followers":4376},"tweet_id":"826832535262986241"}],"news":[{"title":"Fracture Risk Tied to Postmenopausal Steroid Hormone Levels","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=29600368834&p=1pl&v=1&x=Tm-9Ri-GvhqH985VCiFHsw","license":"public","citation_ids":[16028727],"posted_on":"2017-02-15T22:18:30+00:00","summary":"Reuters Health Information By Anne Harding | February 15, 2017 NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Sex steroid hormone levels influence postmenopausal fracture risk independently of other fracture risk factors, new findings show.","author":{"name":"Medscape","url":"http:\/\/medscape.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/055\/normal\/medscape.png?1369846939"}}]}}
