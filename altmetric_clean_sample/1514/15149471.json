Gene therapy using growth factors such as VEGF seems to be a viable approach for potential therapeutic treatment of PD. In this study, we utilized a novel non-viral gene carrier designated as PEI-PLL synthesized by our laboratory to deliver VEGF gene to study its effect by using both cell culture as well as animal models of PD. For cell culture experiments, we utilized 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mediated cell death model of MN9D cells following transfection with either a control plasmid or VEGF expressing plasmid. As compared to control transfected cells, PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery to MN9D cells resulted in increased cell viability, increase in the number of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells and decreased apoptosis following 6-OHDA insult. Next, we studied the therapeutic potential of PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery in SNPc by using unilateral 6-OHDA Medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion model of PD in rats. VEGF administration prevented the loss of motor functions induced by 6-OHDA as determined by behavior analysis. Similarly, VEGF inhibited the 6-OHDA mediated loss of DA neurons in Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta (SNPc) as well as DA nerve fibers in striatum as determined by TH immunostaining. In addition, PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery also prevented apoptosis and microglial activation in PD rat models. Together, these results clearly demonstrated the beneficial effects of PEI-PLL mediated VEGF gene delivery on dopaminergic system in both cell culture and animal models of PD Statement of Significance In this report, we exploited the potential of PEI-PLL to deliver VEGF gene for the potential therapeutic treatment of PD by using both cell culture and animal models of PD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of novel polymeric gene carriers for the delivery of VEGF gene to DA neurons with improved transfection efficiency. Finally, the study will lead to a significant advancement in the field of non-viral PD gene therapy treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","authors":["Abid Sheikh, Muhammad","Saeed Malik, Yousra","Xing, Zhenkai","Guo, Zhaopei","Tian, Huayu","Zhu, Xiaojuan","Chen, Xuesi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actbio.2016.12.048","first_seen_on":"2016-12-30T23:16:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-7568","17427061"],"journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","last_mentioned_on":1483139688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28025049"],"pmid":"28025049","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Polylysine-modified polyethylenimine (PEI-PLL) mediated VEGF gene delivery protects dopaminergic neurons in cell culture and in rat models of Parkinson's Disease (PD)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polylysinemodified-polyethylenimine-peipll-mediated-vegf-gene-delivery-protects-dopaminergic-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":1110198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6776071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253884,"mean":12.455051830961,"rank":53636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":196821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253884,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1255,"mean":5.0498771929825,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1255,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":7.7257866666667,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
