Although the specific function of \u03b1-Syn is still unclear, its high structural plasticity is key for the interactions of \u03b1-Syn with biological membranes. Recently, it has been observed that \u03b1-Syn is able to form high-density lipoprotein-like (HDL-like) particles that are reminiscent of self-assembling phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs. Here, we extended our preparation method for the production of \u03b1-Syn lipoprotein particles to the \u03b2- and \u03b3-Syn variants, and the PD-related familial \u03b1-Syn mutants. We show that all human Syns can form stable and homogeneous populations of HDL-like particles with distinct morphologies. Our results characterize the impact of the individual Syns on the formation capacity of these particles and indicate that Syn HDL-like particles are neither causing toxicity nor a toxicity-related loss of \u03b1-Syn in PD.
