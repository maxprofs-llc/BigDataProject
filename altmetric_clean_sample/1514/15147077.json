Here, the taxonomy and evolution of the Malagasy grass lineage Chasechloa was investigated with the aid of NGS.\nFull chloroplast genome data and some nuclear sequences were produced by NGS from old herbarium specimens, while some selected markers were generated from recently collected Malagasy grasses. In addition, a scanning electron microscopy analysis of the upper floret and cross-sections of the rachilla appendages followed by staining with Sudan IV were performed on Chasechloa to examine the morphology of the upper floret and the presence of oils in the appendages.\nChasechloa was recovered within tribe Paniceae, sub-tribe Boivinellinae, contrary to its previous placement as a member of the New World genus Echinolaena (tribe Paspaleae). Chasechloa originated in Madagascar between the Upper Miocene and the Pliocene. It comprises two species, one of them collected only once in 1851. The genus is restricted to north-western seasonally dry deciduous forests. The appendages at the base of the upper floret of Chasechloa have been confirmed as elaiosomes, an evolutionary adaptation for myrmecochory.\nChasechloa is reinstated at the generic level and a taxonomic treatment is presented, including conservation assessments of its species. Our study also highlights the power of NGS technology to analyse relictual or probably extinct groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002271","authors":["Christian Silva","Guillaume Besnard","Anthony Piot","Jacqueline Razanatsoa","Reyjane P.
