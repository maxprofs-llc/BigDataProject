Current data concerning exposures at a European level are required.\nTo describe demographics and MI exposures for European patients with MI contact allergy.\nEleven European dermatology departments from eight European countries prospectively collected data between 1 May and 31 October 2015 among consecutive patients who had positive patch test reactions to MI (2000\u2009ppm aq.).\nA total of 6.0% (205\/3434; range 2.6-13.0%) of patients had positive patch test reactions to MI. Dermatitis most frequently affected the hands (43.4%), face (32.7%), arms (14.6%), and eyelids (11.7%); 12.7% had widespread dermatitis. For 72.7% (149\/205), MI contact allergy was currently relevant mainly because of exposure to cosmetic products (83.2%; 124\/149). Of these 124 patients, 19.5% were exposed to leave-on and rinse-off cosmetic products, 24.8% only to leave-on cosmetic products and 38.9% only to rinse-off cosmetic products containing MI or methylchloroisothiazolinone\/MI. The majority of these (79%) noted onset of their dermatitis between 2013 and 2015. Fifteen patients (7.3%) had previously experienced allergic reactions when they were in newly painted rooms.\nClinically relevant MI contact allergy remains prevalent across European countries, mainly because of exposure to rinse-off and leave-on cosmetic products.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000260f","authors":["Schwensen, Jakob F.","Uter, Wolfgang","Bruze, Magnus","Svedman, Cecilia","Goossens, An","Wilkinson, Mark","Gim\u00e9nez Arnau, Ana","Gon\u00e7alo, Margarida","Andersen, Klaus E.","Paulsen, Evy","Agner, Tove","Foti, Caterina","Aalto\u2010Korte, Kristiina","McFadden, John","White, Ian","Johansen, Jeanne D."],"doi":"10.1111\/cod.12733","first_seen_on":"2016-12-30T14:45:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0536"],"journal":"Contact Dermatitis (01051873)","last_mentioned_on":1483442598,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/wol1\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cod.12733\/pdf","pmid":"28032337","pubdate":"2016-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"The epidemic of methylisothiazolinone: a European prospective study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemic-methylisothiazolinone-european-prospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":1426547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6545954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254967,"mean":12.444056360456,"rank":65031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":189654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254967,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1262,"mean":3.0092989690722,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1262,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.89583333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
