Few studies have examined risk factors by histologic subtype, despite evidence of different risk profiles.\nIn this population-based case-control study, 451 childhood malignant GCT cases ages 0-5 years were identified from the California Cancer Registry. Differentiating between common histologic subtypes, we identified 181 yolk sac tumors, 216 teratomas, and 54 rarer subtypes. Cases were linked to their birth certificates and 271,381 controls, frequency matched by birth year, were randomly selected from California birthrolls to investigate the contributions of demographic, gestational, and pregnancy factors using unconditional logistic regression analysis.\nCompared to non-Hispanic whites, Asian\/Pacific Islander children were at an increased risk for developing GCTs (odds ratio [OR]=1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.47, 2.56). Among pregnancy complications and procedures, yolk sac tumors were positively associated with the presence of fetopelvic disproportion (OR=2.97; 95% CI=1.55, 5.68), while teratomas were strongly associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios (OR=14.76; 95% CI=7.21, 30.19) and the presence of an ear, face, or neck anomaly at birth (OR=93.70; 95% CI=42.14, 208.82).\nMalignant yolk sac tumors and malignant teratomas exhibited distinct demographic and gestational characteristics; additionally, complications in pregnancy and labor may be brought on by specific histologic subtypes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249a","authors":["Hall, Clinton","Ritz, Beate","Cockburn, Myles","Davidson, Tom B","Heck, Julia E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canep.2016.12.002","endpage":"49","first_seen_on":"2016-12-30T15:56:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1877-783X","18777821"],"journal":"Cancer Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1483113363,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1877782116302417"],"pmid":"28013088","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"42","subjects":["neoplasms","epidemiology"],"title":"Risk of malignant childhood germ cell tumors in relation to demographic, gestational, and perinatal characteristics","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-malignant-childhood-germ-cell-tumors-relation-demographic-gestational-perinatal-characteristics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":4176365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2221824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253883,"mean":12.455139686941,"rank":142428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":87177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253883,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":9.4036721311475,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.548,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnEpidemiolgst\/statuses\/814862623900504064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15146499],"posted_on":"2016-12-30T15:56:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Julia Heck","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/665577693145128960\/AlIluOAl_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor of Epidemiology at UCLA.
