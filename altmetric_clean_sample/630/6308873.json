Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NaCl, sodium-salicylate and low pH on carbapenem susceptibility in A. baumannii. We cloned different oxacillinase (OXA) subclasses from carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates with their associated promoter into the same vector and transferred them to the A. baumannii reference strains ATCC 19606 and ATCC 17978. Carbapenem MICs were determined at least in triplicate by agar dilution under standard conditions, as well as in the presence of 200 mM NaCl, 16 mM sodium-salicylate and at pH 5.8. OXA-58-like gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR. A significant MIC reduction under some experimental conditions was shown for some transformants but not for others. The only example where all transformants harboring the same OXA were affected by the same condition was OXA-58-like at pH 5.8, resulting in imipenem and meropenem MICs decreasing from a resistant level (32 to 64 mg\/L) to an intermediate-susceptible level (8 mg\/L). However, blaOXA58-like gene expression remained the same. Wildtype MICs of both reference strains were not affected by the tested conditions. Our results indicate that the effect of the tested experimental conditions on OXAs in vivo is mostly strain-dependent. MICs were not reduced to wildtype level which implies that the tested conditions don't lead to complete OXA inhibition in the bacterial cell.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["Zander, Esther","Seifert, Harald","Higgins, Paul G","Esther Zander","Harald Seifert","Paul G.
