However, choosing a valve implant type is still a subject of debate. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the early and late outcomes of mitral valve replacement [mechanical (MMV) vs. bioprosthetic (BMV)] for severe mitral stenosis.\nA retrospective cohort study was performed on data involving mitral stenosis patients who have undergone mitral valve replacement with either BMV (n\u00a0=\u00a050) or MMV (n\u00a0=\u00a0145) valves from 1999 to 2012. Data were collected from the patients' records and follow-up through telephone calls. Data were analyzed for early and late mortality, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes, stroke, pre- and postoperative echocardiographic findings, early and late valve-related complications, and survival. Chi-square test, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curve, and dependent proportions tests were some of the tests employed in the analysis.\nA total of 195 patients were included in the study with a 30-day follow-up echocardiogram available for 190 patients (97.5%), while 103 (53%) were available for follow-up over the telephone. One patient died early postoperatively; twelve patients died late in the postoperative period, six in the bioprosthesis group and six in the mechanical group. The late mortality had a significant association with postoperative stroke (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and postoperative NYHA Classes III and IV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Postoperative NYHA class was significantly associated with age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), pulmonary disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), mitral valve implant type (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and postoperative stroke (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02); 14 patients had strokes in the mechanical (9) and in the bioprosthetic (5) groups. NYHA classes were significantly better after the replacement surgeries (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). BMV were significantly associated with worse survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), worse NYHA postoperatively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and more reoperations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Survival was significantly better with MMV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). When the two groups were matched for age and mitral regurgitation, the analysis revealed that BMV were significantly associated with reoperations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) but not significantly associated with worse survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4) or worse NYHA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4).\nMMV replacement in mitral stenosis patients is associated with a lower reoperation rate, but there was no difference in survival compared with BMV replacement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee6","authors":["Alqasem F.
