However, poor viability of donor stem cells after transplantation limits their therapeutic efficiency, whereas, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. Autophagy, a highly conserved process of cellular degradation, is required for maintaining homeostasis and normal function. Here we investigated the potential role of autophagy on apoptosis in BM-MSCs induced by hypoxic injury. BM-MSCs, isolated from male C57BL\/6 mice, were subjected to hypoxia and serum deprivation (H\/SD) injury for 6h, 12h and 24h respectively. The autophagy state was regulated by 3-Methyladenine (3MA) and rapamycin administration. Furthermore, compound C was administrated to inhibit AMPK. The apoptosis induced by H\/SD was determined by TUNEL assays. Meanwhile, autophagy was measured by GFP-LC3 plasmids transfection and transmission electron microscope. Moreover, protein expressions were evaluated by Western blot assay. In the present study, we found that hypoxic stress increased autophagy and apoptosis in BM-MSCs time dependently. Meanwhile, hypoxia increased the activity of AMPK\/mTOR signal pathway. Moreover, increased apoptosis in BM-MSCs under hypoxia was abolished by 3-MA, whereas was aggravated by rapamycin. Furthermore, the increased autophagy and apoptosis in BM-MSCs induced by hypoxia were abolished by AMPK inhibitor compound C. These data provide evidence that hypoxia induced AMPK\/mTOR signal pathway activation which regulated the apoptosis and autophagy in BM-MSCs. Furthermore, the apoptosis of BM-MSCs under hypoxic condition was regulated by autophagy via AMPK\/mTOR pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c3","authors":["Zhang, Zheng","Yang, Ming","Wang, Yabin","Wang, Le","Jin, Zhitao","Ding, Liping","Zhang, Lijuan","Zhang, Lina","Jiang, Wei","Gao, Guojie","Yang, Junke","Lu, Bingwei","Cao, Feng","Hu, Taohong"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbin.10604","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T13:17:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8355"],"journal":"Cell Biology International","last_mentioned_on":1458840758,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27005844?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27005844","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Autophagy regulates the apoptosis of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxic condition via AMP-activated protein kinase\/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autophagy-regulates-apoptosis-bone-marrowderived-mesenchymal-stem-cells-under-hypoxic-condition-via"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435912,"mean":6.4641587488024,"rank":3824547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2081852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435912,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275322,"mean":11.001848620337,"rank":150000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275322,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":1.847503030303,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.3523076923077,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
