Socio-demographic and criminal data were collected by an ad hoc interview. Mental disorders were assessed with the clinical version of the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Axis I Disorders (SCID-I).\nLife prevalence of mental disorders was 90.2%. The most common mental disorders and substance abuse or dependence was 72.3%, followed by mood disorder (38.5%) and psychotic disorders (34.2%). Moreover, the prevalence of any mental disorder in the last month was 52.2%. The main psychotic disorder (20.7%) was followed by substance abuse or dependence (18.5%), and mood disorder state (13%). A socio-demographic profile as a risk for each disorder was found.\nThe prevalence of people with mental disorders is very high in Spanish prisons, and is associated with a distinct demographic profile. It is essential to continue researching this reality, translating the results into therapeutic and preventive action adapted to the status of inmates to reduce social inequalities in this high priority public health situation.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e12a83eeb12a8b490a","authors":["Zabala-Ba\u00f1os, M C","Segura, A","Maestre-Miquel, C","Mart\u00ednez-Lorca, M","Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00edn, B","Romero, D","Rodr\u00edguez, M"],"doi":"10.4321\/s1575-06202016000100003","endpage":"23","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T12:50:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1575-0620"],"issue":"1","journal":"Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Sanidad Penitenciaria","last_mentioned_on":1458810976,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26997288"],"pmid":"26997288","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"13","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Mental disorder prevalence and associated risk factors in three prisons of Spain","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-disorder-prevalence-associated-risk-factors-three-prisons-spain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7435912,"mean":6.4641587488024,"rank":5626702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7435912,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275323,"mean":11.001569485911,"rank":193605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275323,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.5703703703704,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BibliotecaCPPon\/statuses\/712931022816616449","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6307134],"posted_on":"2016-03-24T09:16:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Biblioteca CP Ponent","url":"http:\/\/llegimbibliotecacpponent.blogspot.com.es\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3414296137\/00eef0a150a42874eab849e915d2b5c7_normal.png","description":"Biblioteca del Centre Penitenciari Ponent","id_on_source":"BibliotecaCPPon","tweeter_id":"1246040612","geo":{"lt":41.61674,"ln":0.62218,"country":"ES"},"followers":1130},"tweet_id":"712931022816616449"}]}}
