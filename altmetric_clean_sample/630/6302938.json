Seventy-two hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver transplant patients and 10 recipients in whom HCV was eradicated before transplantation were included in the study.\nThe levels of all biomarkers were significantly higher in HCV-infected recipients than in controls. Among HCV recipients, levels of biomarkers were significantly higher in patients with severe recurrence. Although there were no statistically significant differences between biomarkers, APRI, ELF, and FIB-4 obtained the highest area under the ROC curve values. The combination of serum biomarkers with Fibroscan increased the negative and positive predictive values, although diagnostic accuracy of individual tests was not significantly improved.\nPatients at higher risk of severe HCV recurrence can be identified early, 6 months after transplantation, using readily available noninvasive methods.
