One model suggested that a rare \u03b2-cell sub-population within islets demonstrated multi-lineage plasticity. We hypothesized that \u03b2-cells from young mice (postnatal day 7, P7) exhibit such plasticity and used a model of islet dedifferentiation towards a ductal epithelial-cell phenotype to test this theory. RIPCre;Z\/AP(+\/+) mice were used to lineage trace the fate of \u03b2-cells during dedifferentiation culture by a human placental alkaline phosphatase (HPAP) reporter. There was a significant loss of HPAP-expressing \u03b2-cells in culture, but remaining HPAP(+)cells lost insulin expression whilst gaining expression of the epithelial duct cell marker cytokeratin-19 (Ck19). Flow cytometry and recovery of \u03b2-cell subpopulations from whole pancreas vs. islets suggest that the HPAP(+)Ck19(+) cells had derived from insulin-positive, glucose-transporter-2-low (Ins(+)Glut2(LO)) cells, representing 3.5% of all insulin-expressing cells. The majority of these cells were found outside of islets within clusters of <5 \u03b2-cells. These insulin(+)Glut2(LO) cells demonstrated a greater proliferation rate in vivo and in vitro as compared to insulin(+)Glut2(+) cells at P7, were retained into adulthood, and a subset differentiated into endocrine, ductal, and neural lineages, illustrating substantial plasticity. Results were confirmed using RIPCre;ROSA- eYFP mice. Quantitative PCR data indicated these cells possess an immature \u03b2-cell phenotype. These Ins(+)Glut2(LO) cells may represent a resident population of cells capable of forming new, functional \u03b2-cells, and which may be potentially exploited for regenerative therapies in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a96","authors":["Beamish, Christine A","Strutt, Brenda J","Arany, Edith J","Hill, David J","Christine A.
