For females, the mean age in incident (61.8 \u00b1 14.9 years) and prevalent (58.3 \u00b1 15.2 years) patients was higher than for males (60.2 \u00b1 14.8 and 56.5 \u00b1 14.9 years, respectively) (P < 0.001 for both analyses). Also, body mass index was higher, while the hemoglobin level, and the percentage of interdialytic weight gain and arteriovenous fistula were lower. Serum phosphorus was similar in both genders in incident cases, while it was lower in prevalent female patients. Serum parathyroid hormone levels were lower in incident, but higher in prevalent male cases. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and vitamin D preparations were more frequently used in female incident and prevalent patients. Hospitalization was more frequent in prevalent females, while it did not differ significantly in the incident cases. Overall, no significant difference was observed in survival rates at 3 years in both incident and prevalent male and female patients.\nMany parameters differ significantly between female and male dialysis patients. Considering the effects of sex on several parameters may be a valuable approach for achieving better outcomes when formulating treatment strategies in this patient population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7ed3cf058f61000b622","authors":["Ayse Serra Artan","Fatih Kircelli","Ercan Ok","Murvet Yilmaz","Gulay Asci","Cengiz Dogan","Ozgur Oto","Kutay Gunestepe","Ali Basci","Mehmet Sukru Sever","Artan, Ayse Serra","Kircelli, Fatih","Ok, Ercan","Yilmaz, Murvet","Asci, Gulay","Dogan, Cengiz","Oto, Ozgur","Gunestepe, Kutay","Basci, Ali","Sever, Mehmet Sukru"],"doi":"10.1093\/ckj\/sfw013","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T20:01:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2048-8513","2048-8505"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Kidney Journal","last_mentioned_on":1462880847,"links":["http:\/\/m.ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013","http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/m.ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013.full.pdf","http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013.abstract","http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013.abstract'"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ckj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/07\/ckj.sfw013.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4886909","pmid":"27274838","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Dialyzing women and men: does it matter?
