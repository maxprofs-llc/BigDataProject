To avoid excess intake, we can improve the estimation using computer methods. Parkland and Brooke are the commonly used formulas, and recently, a new, an easy formula is been used, i.e. the 'Rule of TEN'. Fluid resuscitation should be titrated to maintain the urine output of approximately 30-35mL\/h for an average-sized adult. The most commonly used fluids are crystalloid, but the phenomenon of creep flow has renewed interest in albumin. In severely burn patients, monitoring with transpulmonary thermodilution together with lactate, ScvO2 and intraabdominal pressures is a good option. Nurse-driven protocols or computer-based resuscitation algorithms reduce the dependence on clinical decision making and decrease fluid resuscitation intake. High-dose vitamin C, propranolol, the avoidance of excessive use of morphine and mechanical ventilation are other useful resources.","authors":["S\u00e1nchez-S\u00e1nchez, M","Garc\u00eda-de-Lorenzo, A","Asensio, M J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.medin.2015.12.001","endpage":"124","first_seen_on":"2016-04-08T15:51:48+00:00","issns":["1578-6749","02105691"],"issue":"2","journal":"Medicina Intensiva","last_mentioned_on":1460142464,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0210569116000024?utm_content=buffer81860&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"26873418","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"118","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"First resuscitation of critical burn patients: progresses and problems","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-resuscitation-critical-burn-patients-progresses-problems"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/seeiucoficial\/statuses\/718466205556830211","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6561174],"posted_on":"2016-04-08T15:51:06+00:00","author":{"name":"SEEIUC","url":"http:\/\/www.seeiuc.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/607136876961628160\/UlQ8iZs__normal.jpg","description":"Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Enfermer\u00eda Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias \/ Spanish Association of Critical Care Nurses and Coronary Unit","id_on_source":"seeiucoficial","tweeter_id":"3309137926","geo":{"lt":40.42526,"ln":-3.69063,"country":"ES"},"followers":1206},"tweet_id":"718466205556830211"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Ana_Sanchezv\/statuses\/718515691758960641","license":"gnip","rt":["seeiucoficial"],"citation_ids":[6561174],"posted_on":"2016-04-08T19:07:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Ana S\u00e1nchez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/737598415895334914\/OfIFJ8mY_normal.jpg","description":"Buscar, sonre\u00edr, observar, so\u00f1ar, disfrutar, ayudar, compartir, encontrar, sentir, comentar, trabajar, conocer, pensar, VIVIR","id_on_source":"Ana_Sanchezv","tweeter_id":"382110638","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":316},"tweet_id":"718515691758960641"}]}}
