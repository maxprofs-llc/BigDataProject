In the crystal, the components form hydrogen-bonded sheets linked by N-H\u22efO and O-H\u22efN inter-actions, which stack along the a axis. A comparison to a related and previously published co-crystal of 5-amino-isophthalic acid and the shorter 4,4'-bipryidine is presented.","authors":["McGuire, S.C.","Travis, S.C.","Tuohey, D.W.","Deering, T.J.","Martin, B.","Cox, J.M.","Benedict, J.B.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989016005259","endpage":"642","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T00:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"5","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1494573448,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989016005259","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?hb7561"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2016\/05\/00\/hb7561\/hb7561.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4908539","pmid":"27308008","pubdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","startpage":"639","title":"Crystal structure of the co-crystal of 5-aminoisophthalic acid and 1,2-bis(pyridin-4-yl)ethene","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-cocrystal-5aminoisophthalic-acid-12bispyridin4ylethene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
