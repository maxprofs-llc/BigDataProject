Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people in the United States and worldwide, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD). While some early-onset forms of AD and PD are hereditary, the sporadic or late-onset cases are believed to result from lifestyle and environmental factors. On the contrary, Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease solely caused by mutations in the gene for huntingtin protein. The disease mechanisms at play for all three disorders remain elusive, hampering efforts to develop effective therapeutic interventions. In light of this, the discovery of robust biomarkers is crucial in order to identify people at-risk for AD and PD, preferably before symptoms arise. For all three diseases, the identification of biomarkers would not only allow development of treatments but also evaluation and adjustment of these with disease progression. It is now understood that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases, along with subsequent immune activation. Therefore, research is actively ongoing to discover and evaluate inflammatory and immune-related biomarkers. Recent progress in this area for AD, PD, and HD is presented here.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Clark, Lorraine Fuhrmann","Kodadek, Thomas","Lorraine F.
