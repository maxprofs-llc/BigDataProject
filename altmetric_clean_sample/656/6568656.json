There is concern that residents are at risk of receiving inadequate training due to the low number of operations they perform. In Brazil, although all GS residents receive by law the Board Certification at the end of their programs, the assessment of their technical skills is not mandatory in Medical Residency programs' training. Consequently, our concern was that current GS medical residency format might be insufficient to create competent and autonomous general surgery residents after 2\u00a0years of regular training. Hence, the aim was to assess GS residents' surgical skills in their final months of training to evaluate the present format of GS residency programs in Brazil.\nTrained surgical faculty members directly observed 11 operations of varying difficulty performed by 2nd-year regular GS residents and by 4th-year residents in the optional Advanced Program in General Surgery. Participants were located at 3 university and 3 nonuniversity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Brazil's largest cities). Surgical skills were assessed using an internally developed observation checklist reviewed by subject matter experts.\nSixty residents (46 regular 2nd-year trainees and 14 advanced 4th-year trainees) were assessed on performing 499 operations. Only 10 residents (17%), all advanced 4th-year residents, satisfactorily performed all operations and were considered eligible for the Board Certification. Even after excluding the 2 operations of greatest difficulty, only 24 regular 2nd-year residents (52%) satisfactorily performed the other 9 operations. Residents from hospitals with open Emergency Departments performed better than those from hospitals without Emergency Departments. Insights: The results of this pilot study suggest that residents with 2\u00a0years of training are not prepared for independent high-level surgical practice. The current formatting of regular GS residency programs in Brazil (2 years) may be insufficient to train experts in general surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f61000135e","authors":["Santos, Elizabeth G","Salles, Gil F"],"doi":"10.1080\/10401334.2016.1152900","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T02:51:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8015","1040-1334"],"journal":"Teaching and Learning in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1460570400,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/iupV4VbvahS7xQgTIUKs\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27054696?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27054696","pubdate":"2016-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["medicine","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Are 2 Years Enough?
