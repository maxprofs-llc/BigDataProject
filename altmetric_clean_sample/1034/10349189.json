A qualitative approach has been used in the analyses.\n393 women have answered the open-ended question. One hundred and ninety four women did describe positive aspects of menopause. The total number of different quotations with a positive content was 268. The answers varied from unspecific statements describing a period of well-being or simply a statement of not having problems at all, and concrete descriptions which primarily dealt with the relief of ending menstruating and attached problems, such as PMS and fear of pregnancy. Finally they dealt with the possibility of personal growth and freedom to concentrate on own requirements.\nThe positive aspect of menopause is a relevant field to investigate further, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. It is recommended that doctors include positive aspects and women's own resources in counselling, to avoid medicalization and dis-empowerment in this period of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003078","authors":["Hvas, L"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0378-5122(01)00184-0","endpage":"17","first_seen_on":"2016-08-09T10:11:28+00:00","issns":["0378-5122","03785122"],"issue":"1","journal":"Maturitas","last_mentioned_on":1481967495,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378512201001840","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11451616"],"pmid":"11451616","pubdate":"2001-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"11","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Positive aspects of menopause","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-aspects-menopause-qualitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348912,"mean":7.0413045991191,"rank":3623634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4605763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348912,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259344,"mean":11.980478031024,"rank":104353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":150317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259344,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1397,"mean":5.4384226361031,"rank":720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1397,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":3.593137254902,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
