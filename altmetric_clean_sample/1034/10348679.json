The mechanism that incites such prevalent anti-PF4\/heparin antibody production in over 50% of patients exposed to heparin in some clinical settings is poorly understood. To investigate early events associated with antigen exposure, we first examined the interaction of PF4\/heparin complexes with cells circulating in whole blood. In healthy donors, PF4\/heparin complexes bind preferentially to B-cells (>90% B-cells bind to PF4\/heparin in vitro) relative to neutrophils, monocytes or T-cells. Binding of PF4 to B-cells is heparin-dependent, and PF4\/heparin complexes are found on circulating B-cells from some, but not all, patients receiving heparin. Given the high proportion of B-cells that bind PF4\/heparin, we investigated complement as a mechanism for non-cognate antigen recognition. Complement is activated by PF4\/heparin complexes, co-localizes with antigen on B-cells from healthy donors, and is present on antigen-positive B-cells in patients receiving heparin. Binding of PF4\/heparin complexes to B-cells is mediated through the interaction between complement with complement receptor 2 (CR2;CD21). To our knowledge, these are the first studies to demonstrate complement activation by PF4\/heparin complexes, opsonization of PF4\/heparin to B-cells via CD21, and presence of complement activation fragments on circulating B-cells in some patients receiving heparin. Given the critical contribution of complement to humoral immunity, our observations provide new mechanistic insights into the immunogenicity of PF4\/heparin complexes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Khandelwal, Sanjay","Lee, Grace M","Hester, C Garren","Poncz, Mortimer","McKenzie, Steven","Sachais, Bruce S","Rauova, Lubica","Kelsoe, Garnett","Cines, Douglas B","Frank, Michael","Arepally, Gowthami M","Sanjay Khandelwal","Grace M.
