Subjects were included if they presented to a single tertiary specialized clinic and obtained a diagnosis of AMPS between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2014.\nInformation collected from subjects' medical records included: past medications, current outpatient medications, procedures, aids, therapies, studies, professionals seen, hospitalizations, and surgeries. Trends in medicalization were analyzed by year of initial visit.\nMedication use, procedures, studies, therapies, professionals seen, hospitalizations, and surgeries in children with AMPS all increased significantly by year (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The degree of physical dysfunction, pain, and the use of aids did not significantly increase.\nChildren with amplified musculoskeletal pain syndrome are becoming increasingly medicalized. Increased medicalization introduces risk of iatrogenic injury and burdens families with unnecessary medical costs. The significant increase in medicalization of children with AMPS is not related to an increase in patient reported pain, which is evidenced by the lack of significant increase in patients' pain score, pain duration, or functional disability at the time of their initial evaluation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003282","authors":["Kaufman, Elizabeth L","Tress, Jenna","Sherry, David D","Kaufman, Elizabeth L.","Sherry, David D."],"doi":"10.1093\/pm\/pnw188","first_seen_on":"2016-08-09T10:02:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-4637","1526-2375"],"journal":"Pain Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1497361214,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27497319?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article\/18\/5\/825\/2924755\/Trends-in-Medicalization-of-Children-with#.WTVeR78w12A.twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/painmedicine\/article-pdf\/18\/5\/825\/17083205\/pnw188.pdf","pmid":"27497319","pubdate":"2016-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"pnw188","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Trends in Medicalization of Children with Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-medicalization-children-amplified-musculoskeletal-pain-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":3480707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4834058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259444,"mean":11.979744730056,"rank":97090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":160159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259444,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":8.0776976421637,"rank":656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":7.9080357142857,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fmauk\/statuses\/762952148116135937","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10348911],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T10:02:21+00:00","author":{"name":"FMA UK","url":"http:\/\/www.fmauk.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902109239983964161\/IoSjGVrA_normal.jpg","description":"Fibromyalgia Action UK (FMA UK) is a UK charity for people living with fibromyalgia.
