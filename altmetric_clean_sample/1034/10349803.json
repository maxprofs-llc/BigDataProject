However, such methods depend on the availability of donors and the assumption of reproducibility between microbial communities before experimental treatments commence. The aim of this study was to develop a frozen standardised inoculum (FSI) which minimizes inter-individual variation and to determine its stability over time using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques.\nA method for the preparation difference of a FSI is described which involves pooling the faecal samples, centrifugation and pelleting of the cell biomass and finally homogenising the cell pellets with phosphate buffer and glycerol. Using this approach, no significant difference in total anaerobe cell viability was observed between the fresh standardised inoculum (before freezing) and the 12days post freezing FSI. Moreover, Quantitative PCR revealed no significant alterations in the estimated bacterial numbers in the FSI preparations for any of the phyla. MiSeq sequencing revealed minute differences in the relative abundance at phylum, family and genus levels between the FSI preparations. Differences in the microbiota denoted as significant were limited between preparations in the majority of cases to changes in percentage relative abundance of \u00b10.5%. The independently prepared FSIs revealed a high degree of reproducibility in terms of microbial composition between the three preparations.\nThis study provides a method to produce a standardised human faecal inoculum suitable for freezing. Based on culture-dependent and independent analysis, the method ensures a degree of reproducibility between preparations by lessening the effect of inter-individual variation among the donors, thereby making the system more suitable for the accurate interpretation of the effects of experimental treatments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e54","authors":["O'Donnell, Michelle M","Rea, Mary C","O'Sullivan, \u00d3rla","Flynn, Cal","Jones, Beth","McQuaid, Albert","Shanahan, Fergus","Ross, R Paul","Michelle M.
