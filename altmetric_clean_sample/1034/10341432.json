In this work, we constructed a dataset of one hundred mitochondrial genomes of bivalves to perform the first systematic comparative mitogenomic analysis, developing a phylogenetic background to scaffold the evolutionary history of the class' mitochondrial genomes. Highly conserved domains were identified in all protein coding genes; however, four genes (namely, atp6, nad2, nad4L, and nad6) were found to be very divergent for many respects, notwithstanding the overall purifying selection working on thse genomes. Moreover, the atp8 gene was newly annotated in 20 mitochondrial genomes, where it was previously declared as lacking or only signaled. Supernumerary mitochondrial proteins were compared, but it was possible to find homologies only among strictly related species. The rearrengement rate on the molecule is too high to be used as a phylogenetic marker, but here we demonstrate for the first time in molluscs that there is correlation between rearrengement rates and evolutionary rates. We also developed a new index (HERMES) to estimate the amount of mitochondrial evolution. Many genomic features are phylogenetically congruent and this allowed us to highlight three main phases in bivalve history: the origin, the branching of palaeoheterodonts, and the second radiation leading to the present-day biodiversity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f6100005a7","authors":["Federico Plazzi","Guglielmo Puccio","Marco Passamonti"],"doi":"10.1093\/gbe\/evw187","endpage":"2564","first_seen_on":"2016-08-09T03:29:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1759-6653"],"issue":"8","journal":"Genome Biology & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1473197642,"links":["http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/08\/gbe.evw187.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/08\/gbe.evw187.full.pdf+html","https:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/evw187v1?rss=1&ssource=mfr"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/gbe.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/08\/gbe.evw187.full.pdf","pmid":"27503296","pubdate":"2016-08-10T22:04:47+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"evw187","subjects":["molecularbiology","biology"],"title":"Comparative large-scale mitogenomics evidences clade-specific evolutionary trends in mitochondrial DNAs of Bivalvia","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-largescale-mitogenomics-evidences-cladespecific-evolutionary-trends-mitochondrial-dnas-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":3950894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4200679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259237,"mean":11.977141955592,"rank":118976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":131888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259237,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1369,"mean":7.8185994152047,"rank":915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1369,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":8.0994888888889,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OfficialSMBE\/statuses\/762853199271178242","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10341432],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T03:29:10+00:00","author":{"name":"OfficialSMBE","url":"http:\/\/www.smbe.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3370866008\/adc90a6563e4747614adfdd483e2b8a6_normal.png","description":"Announcements for the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution http:\/\/www.smbe.org\/ http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OfficialSMBE Tweets by @genomesevolve","id_on_source":"OfficialSMBE","tweeter_id":"1120098811","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3369},"tweet_id":"762853199271178242"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/f_ghiselli\/statuses\/762875340721156096","license":"gnip","rt":["OfficialSMBE"],"citation_ids":[10341432],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T04:57:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Fabrizio Ghiselli","url":"https:\/\/www.unibo.it\/sitoweb\/fabrizio.ghiselli\/research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/497751961932816384\/BRGRJ4Bq_normal.jpeg","description":"An evolutionary biologist obsessed with genomic wars and alliances...
