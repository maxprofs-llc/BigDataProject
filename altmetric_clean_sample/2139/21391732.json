On the other hand, admixture mapping, which is performed in case of populations consisting of a recent mix of two ancestral groups, relies on the ancestry information at each locus (locus-specific ancestry). Recently it has been proposed to jointly model genotype and locus-specific ancestry within the framework of single marker tests. Here, we extend this approach for population-based GWAS in the direction of multimarker models. A modified version of the Bayesian information criterion is developed for building a multilocus model that accounts for the differential correlation structure due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and admixture LD. Simulation studies and a real data example illustrate the advantages of this new approach compared to single-marker analysis or modern model selection strategies based on separately analyzing genotype and ancestry data, as well as to single-marker analysis combining genotypic and ancestry information. Depending on the signal strength, our procedure automatically chooses whether genotypic or locus-specific ancestry markers are added to the model. This results in a good compromise between the power to detect causal mutations and the precision of their localization. The proposed method has been implemented in R and is available at http:\/\/www.math.uni.wroc.pl\/~mbogdan\/admixtures\/.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751e","authors":["Szulc, Piotr","Bogdan, Malgorzata","Frommlet, Florian","Tang, Hua"],"doi":"10.1002\/gepi.22056","first_seen_on":"2017-06-28T13:15:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1098-2272","0741-0395"],"journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1501840831,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.22056\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.22056\/abstract;jsessionid=E6AC5D0669A07F1BF4110DF31B5663CC.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.22056\/pdf","pmid":"28657151","pubdate":"2017-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Joint genotype\u2010 and ancestry\u2010based genome\u2010wide association studies in admixed populations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/joint-genotype-ancestrybased-genomewide-association-studies-admixed-populations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3907502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4379448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228151,"mean":12.340502415078,"rank":103981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":122419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228151,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.783472,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.9644444444444,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
