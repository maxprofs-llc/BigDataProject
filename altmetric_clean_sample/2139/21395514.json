It gets worse for bisphenol A: parental exposure linked to adverse neuro effects in offspring. #bpa"],"citation":{"abstract":"Relatively little attention has been given paternal effects on next generation. Given that Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous compound in maternal diet, may disrupt brain development and behavior, we hypothesized that paternal BPA diet (PBD) could affect offspring development. Prefrontal cortex (PFC), a vital brain region, is involved in emotion and social behavior. To test whether PBD could alter developing PFC, we carried out a proteomics approach for PFC in male juvenile offspring that responded to PBD (50\u00a0mg BPA\/kg diet). We found that PBD altered the expressions of binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP), CCAAT\/-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), which could reflect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, downregulation of myelinogenesis genes and myelin basic protein (MBP) could provoke myelin deficiency. Furthermore, PBD significantly increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired social behavior in male offspring. Taken together, these results revealed the alterations of ER stress and myelin destruction related molecules induced by PBD might be a potential mechanism for the behavior deficits in their male offspring. These findings remind us of the importance of paternal effects in the further environmental exposure research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f7","authors":["Luo, Guangying","Wei, Ruifen","Wang, Shaolin","Wang, Jundong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemosphere.2017.06.050","first_seen_on":"2017-06-28T16:26:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0045-6535","00456535"],"journal":"Chemosphere","last_mentioned_on":1498667171,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0045653517309529"],"pmid":"28641223","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Paternal bisphenol a diet changes prefrontal cortex proteome and provokes behavioral dysfunction in male offspring","type":"article","volume":"184","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paternal-bisphenol-diet-changes-prefrontal-cortex-proteome-provokes-behavioral-dysfunction-male-offs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":4506213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2350058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236237,"mean":12.984429790548,"rank":131954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236237,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3876,"mean":3.4208294193548,"rank":2661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3876,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.3682385321101,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
