There is a trend that patients request immediate surgical correction, instead of passive vaginal dilatation. Therefore a differentiated counselling should be provided. We present a comparative chart, based on published evidence, with aspect to the available techniques, which will facilitate the decision-making process in the clinical practice. From our point of view, the best results are achieved with techniques that combine the advantages of the minimal-invasive surgery with those derived of the use of peritoneum as covering tissue of the neovagina. Nevertheless there is a lack on interdisciplinary consensus about the best option to restore the physical and sexual quality of life.","altmetric_jid":"56b368402a83ee42788b45ad","authors":["Torres-de la Roche, Luz Angela","Devassy, Rajesh","Gopalakrishnan, Sreelatha","de Wilde, Maya Sophie","Herrmann, Anja","Larbig, Angelika","De Wilde, Rudy Leon","Luz Angela Torres-de la Roche","Rajesh Devassy","Sreelatha Gopalakrishnan","Maya Sophie de Wilde","Anja Herrmann","Angelika Larbig","Rudy Leon De Wilde"],"doi":"10.3205\/iprs000087","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T15:39:52+00:00","issns":["2193-8091"],"journal":"GMS Interdisciplinary Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery DGPW","last_mentioned_on":1504798714,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26904393","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4740437"],"pmid":"26904393","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"German Medical Science","title":"Plastic neo-vaginal construction in Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome: an expert opinion paper on the decision-making treatment process.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plastic-neovaginal-construction-mayerrokitanskyk%C3%BCsterhauser-syndrome-expert-opinion-paper-decisionma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":2149364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5086195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123180,"mean":12.087540311255,"rank":38326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":84062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123180,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.915,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"August Franz Josef Karl Mayer","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=799411959#altmetric_citation_8fbb3676-8908-4e96-bfbd-a67af0b340bf","license":"public","citation_ids":[24911940,24911940,24911940],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T15:38:34+00:00","summary":"August Franz Josef Karl Mayer (2 November 1787 in Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd &ndash; 9 November 1865 in Bonn) was a German anatomist and physiologist.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=51314095","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rjwilmsi","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rjwilmsi"}}]}}
