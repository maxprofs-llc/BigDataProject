After scanning the working model, the design software is used to design the crown. The saved STL file is used on the CAD\/CAM milling method and two types of 3D printing method to produce 10 interim crowns per group. Internal discrepancy measurement uses the silicon replica method and the measured data are analyzed with One-way ANOVA to verify the statistic significance.\nThe discrepancy means (standard deviation) of the 3 groups are 171.6 (97.4) \u00b5m for the crown manufactured by the milling system and 149.1 (65.9) and 91.1 (36.4) \u00b5m, respectively, for the crowns manufactured with the two types of 3D printing system. There was a statistically significant difference and the 3D printing system group showed more outstanding value than the milling system group.\nThe marginal and internal fit of the interim restoration has more outstanding 3D printing method than the CAD\/CAM milling method. Therefore, the 3D printing method is considered as applicable for not only the interim restoration production, but also in the dental prosthesis production with a higher level of completion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc37","authors":["Wan-Sun Lee","Du-Hyeong Lee","Kyu-Bok Lee"],"doi":"10.4047\/jap.2017.9.4.265","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T15:41:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2005-7806","2005-7814"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Journal of Advanced Prosthodontics","last_mentioned_on":1504798812,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28874993"],"pmcid":"PMC5582092","pmid":"28874993","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Evaluation of internal fit of interim crown fabricated with CAD\/CAM milling and 3D printing system","type":"article","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":7244530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123180,"mean":12.087540311254,"rank":100139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123180,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.4102564102564,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NIHL3D\/statuses\/905817990947590144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24912022],"posted_on":"2017-09-07T15:40:12+00:00","author":{"name":"NIHL 3D Printing","url":"http:\/\/nihlibrary.nih.gov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535844758770311168\/TEZkAxsL_normal.png","description":"National Institutes of Health Library","id_on_source":"NIHL3D","tweeter_id":"2887052859","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":737},"tweet_id":"905817990947590144"}]}}
