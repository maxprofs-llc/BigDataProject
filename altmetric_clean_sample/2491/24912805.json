Although adequate sleep is important after illness and surgery, it has scarcely been studied in the immediate postoperative phase.\nTo determine and compare the nature of self-reported sleep and insomnia, and recorded sleep-wake patterns in octogenarians during the in-hospital postoperative phase after SAVR or TAVI.\nA prospective cohort design was used that included octogenarian patients undergoing SAVR or TAVI at a regional university hospital. Self-reports were used to document sleep and insomnia, and actigraphy was used to record sleep-wake patterns. Data were collected at baseline preoperatively, and then daily for the first five postoperative days.\nSAVR patients experienced the most insomnia on postoperative nights later in recovery, while TAVI patients experienced the most insomnia on postoperative nights early in recovery. The median total sleep time, as measured by actigraphy, was 6.4 h, and the median sleep efficiency was 79% for the five postoperative nights, but no differences were found between SAVR and TAVI patients on this parameter. All patients slept more during daytime than at night, with SAVR patients having significantly more total sleep hours for all five days than TAVI patients (p < 0.01).\nOctogenarians with aortic stenosis had disturbed self-reported sleep, increased insomnia, and disturbed sleep-wake patterns postoperatively, resulting in more daytime sleep and inactivity. In patients undergoing SAVR or TAVI, sleep evolves differently during the in-hospital postoperative phase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002824","authors":["Hege Andersen Amofah","Anders Brostr\u00f6m","Bengt Fridlund","Bj\u00f8rn Bjorvatn","Rune Haaverstad","Karl Ove Hufthammer","Karel KJ Kuiper","Anette Hylen Ranhoff","Tone M Norekv\u00e5l","on behalf of the CARDELIR Investigators"],"doi":"10.1177\/1474515115620992","first_seen_on":"2017-09-07T16:02:09+00:00","issns":["1474-5151","1873-1953"],"journal":"European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1505468715,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?hootPostID=fa25a56303464d73bf4b760765e0559d","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=8aaf88de2f8c40ad8ac77c64a7f3f3f1","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=7e70f1760bbacbe1b6de8c9b84745109","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=52fce71c251f1ef8a47985de0f8971e4","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=d2e5d706ecddae02a0cd6558909eb956","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=3f3dc1d23507de11227d7659dc7df605","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1474515115620992?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=4a616da17ba7dcb81f8633cd33ada066"],"pmid":"26635329","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","cardiology"],"title":"Sleep in octogenarians during the postoperative phase after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleep-octogenarians-during-postoperative-phase-after-transcatheter-surgical-aortic-valve-replacement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.95,"score_history":{"1y":6.95,"6m":6.95,"3m":6.95,"1m":6.95,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":1311085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7104576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143283,"mean":12.174571041722,"rank":28657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":114532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143283,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":4.9778689655172,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.6785714285714,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
