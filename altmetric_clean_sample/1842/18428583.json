The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of DM1 in the 3 major ethnic groups in Malaysia and evaluate the feasibility of a single tube triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) method for diagnosis of DM1 in Malaysia.\nWe used PCR to determine the size of CTG repeats in 377 individuals not known to be affected by DM and 11 DM1 suspected patients, recruited from a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur. TP-PCR was performed on selected samples, followed by Southern blot hybridisation of PCR amplified fragments to confirm and estimate the size of CTG expansion.\nThe number of individuals not known to be affected by DM with (CTG)>18 was determined according to ethnic group and as a whole population. The \u03c7(2) test was performed to compare the distribution of (CTG)>18 with 12 other populations. Additionally, the accuracy of TP-PCR in detecting CTG expansion in 11 patients with DM1 was determined by comparing the results with that from Southern blot hybridisation.\nOf the 754 chromosomes studied, (CTG)>18 frequency of 3.60%, 1.57% and 4.00% in the Malay, Chinese and Indian subpopulations, respectively, was detected, showing similarities to data from Thai, Taiwanese and Kuwaiti populations. We also successfully detected CTG expansions in 9 patients using the TP-PCR method followed by the estimation of CTG expansion size via Southern blot hybridisation.\nThe results show a low DM1 prevalence in Malaysia with the possibility of underdiagnosis and demonstrates the feasibility of using a clinical and TP-PCR-based approach for rapid and cost-effective DM1 diagnosis in developing countries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Ambrose, Kathlin K","Ishak, Taufik","Lian, Lay-Hoong","Goh, Khean-Jin","Wong, Kum-Thong","Ahmad-Annuar, Azlina","Thong, Meow-Keong","Kathlin K Ambrose","Taufik Ishak","Lay-Hoong Lian","Khean-Jin Goh","Kum-Thong Wong","Azlina Ahmad-Annuar","Meow-Keong Thong"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-010711","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T10:01:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"3","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1492077009,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28363916?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28363916"],"pmid":"28363916","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ","title":"\n            Analysis of CTG repeat length variation in the\n            DMPK\n            gene in the general population and the molecular diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 in Malaysia\n          ","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-ctg-repeat-length-variation-idmpki-gene-general-population-molecular-diagnosis-myotonic-dys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":4035628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3828960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235576,"mean":13.074731792423,"rank":121272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":104259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235576,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5766,"mean":16.87297415438,"rank":4021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5766,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":15.294248175182,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
