However, studies are hampered by difficulties achieving study designs with powered sample sizes to elucidate relationships between environmental and produce contamination. Our goal was to quantify, in the agricultural production environment, the relationship between microbial contamination on hands, soil, and water and contamination on fresh produce. In 11 farms and packing facilities in northern Mexico, we applied a matched study design: composite samples (N=636, equivalent to 11,046 units) of produce rinses were matched to water, soil, and worker hand rinses during two growing seasons. Microbial indicators (coliforms, E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and somatic coliphage) were quantified from composite samples. Statistical measures of association and correlations were calculated through Spearman's correlation, linear, and logistic regression models. The concentrations of all microbial indicators were positively correlated between produce and hands (\u03c1 range 0.41-0.75, p<0.01). When hands contained E. coli, the handled produce was nine times more likely to contain E. coli (p<0.05). Similarly, when hands contained coliphage, the handled produce was eight times more likely to contain coliphage (p<0.05). There were relatively low concentrations of indicators in soil and water samples, and a few sporadic significant associations were observed between contamination of soil and water with that of produce. This methodology provides a foundation for future field studies, and results highlight the need for interventions surrounding farmworker hygiene and sanitation to reduce microbial contamination of farmworkers' hands.IMPORTANCE This study of the relationships between microbes on produce and in the farm environment can be used to support the design of targeted interventions to prevent or reduce microbial contamination of fresh produce with associated reductions in foodborne illness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Bartz, Faith E.","Sunshine Lickness, Jacquelyn","Heredia, Norma","Fabiszewski de Aceituno, Anna","Newman, Kira L.","Watson Hodge, Domonique","Jaykus, Lee-Ann","Garc\u00eda, Santos","Leon, Juan S.","Faith E.
