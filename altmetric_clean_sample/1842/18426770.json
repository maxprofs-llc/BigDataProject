All participants were assessed for bone mineral density (BMD) of total body and spine by Dual X-ray absorptiometry, serum 25(OH) vitamin D3, parathyroid hormone (PTH), IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1.\nAt diagnosis, screening-detected celiac disease children as compared to controls had a mean -0,03\u200ag\/cm reduced BMD of both total body and spine (p\u200a=\u200a0.009 and p\u200a=\u200a0.005 respectively), a mean -11.4\u200anmol\/L lower level of 25(OH) vitamin D3 (p\u200a<\u200a0.001) and a mean +1.0\u200apmol\/L higher PTH level (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Systemic levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL12p70, IL13, and TNF\u03b1 were all increased in screening-detected celiac disease as compared to controls (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). No difference in BMD, 25(OH) vitamin D3, PTH and cytokine levels were detected in children on a gluten-free diet compared to controls.\nChildren with screening-detected celiac disease have reduced BMD, lower levels of vitamin D3, higher levels of PTH and signs of systemic inflammation compared with controls. These differences were not found in celiac disease children on a gluten-free diet, indicating that children with screening-detected celiac disease benefit from an early diagnosis and treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dcf","authors":["Sara Bj\u00f6rck","Charlotte Brundin","Magnus Karlsson","Daniel Agardh"],"doi":"10.1097\/mpg.0000000000001568","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T07:18:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0277-2116"],"journal":"Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1491117393,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28319607"],"pmid":"28319607","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","gastroenterology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Reduced Bone Mineral Density in Children with Screening-detected Celiac Disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-bone-mineral-density-children-screeningdetected-celiac-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250143,"mean":13.148271621718,"rank":206878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250143,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2764,"mean":3.7937842924358,"rank":2605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2764,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":6.5866031746032,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
