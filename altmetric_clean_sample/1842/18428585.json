A review of clinical opioid prescribing guidelines highlights the need for more research on safe and effective treatment options for chronic pain, improved guidance for the best management of post-operative pain, and evaluation of the implementation and impact of guideline recommendations on patient risk and outcomes. Although there is increasing attention to training in pain management in medical schools and medical residency programs, educational opportunities remain highly variable, and the need for additional clinician training in the recognition and treatment of pain as well as opioid use disorder has been recognized. Mandated use of private, federal and state educational and clinical initiatives such as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) and Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) generally increase utilization of these initiatives, but more research is needed to determine the impact of these initiatives on provider behaviors, treatment access, and patient outcomes. Finally, there is an acute need for more research on safe and effective treatments for chronic pain as well as an increased multi-level focus on improving training and access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder as well as non-pharmacologic and non-interventional chronic pain treatments, so that these guideline-recommended interventions can become mainstream, accessible, first-line interventions for chronic pain and\/or opioid use disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","authors":["Barth, Kelly S.","Guille, Constance","McCauley, Jenna","Brady, Kathleen T."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drugalcdep.2016.08.641","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T10:01:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0376-8716","1879-0046"],"journal":"Drug & Alcohol Dependence","last_mentioned_on":1491127251,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28363316?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28363316","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Targeting practitioners: A review of guidelines, training, and policy in pain management","type":"article","volume":"173 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeting-practitioners-review-guidelines-training-policy-pain-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250143,"mean":13.148271022059,"rank":206887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250143,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3074,"mean":10.885972014318,"rank":2863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3074,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":16.860162162162,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
