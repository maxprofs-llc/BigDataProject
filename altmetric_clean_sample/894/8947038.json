Here we report how we used these root cultures to investigate precursor-product relationships between phenylpropanoids and phenylphenalenones whose phenyl rings share identical substitution patterns. Four phenylpropanoic acids, including ferulic acid and the unusual 4-methoxycinnamic acid, were used in (13)C-labeled form as substrates to study their incorporation into phenylphenalenones. In addition to the previously reported 2-hydroxy-9-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one (trivial name musanolone F), 2-hydroxy-9-(4'-methoxyphenyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one (proposed trivial name 4'-methoxyanigorufone) was found as a biosynthetic product in A. preissii. The carbon skeleton of 4'-methoxycinnamic acid was biosynthetically incorporated as an intact unit including its 4'-O-methyl substituent at the lateral phenyl ring. 4'-Methoxyanigorufone is reported here for the first time as a natural product.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003327","authors":["Hidalgo, William","Kai, Marco","Schneider, Bernd"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phytochem.2015.07.017","endpage":"481","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T10:53:23+00:00","issns":["1873-3700","00319422"],"journal":"Phytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1466506357,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26218676?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26218676","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"476","subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"4-Methoxycinnamic acid \u2013 An unusual phenylpropanoid involved in phenylphenalenone biosynthesis in Anigozanthos preissii","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/4methoxycinnamic-acid-unusual-phenylpropanoid-involved-phenylphenalenone-biosynthesis-anigozanthos-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262697,"mean":11.547108459969,"rank":219986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262697,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1519,"mean":3.032906455863,"rank":1292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1519,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.88333333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
