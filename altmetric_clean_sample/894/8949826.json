Recently, it was reported that the formation of supercomplex In + IIIn + IVn in mice largely depends on their genetic background. However, in this study, we showed that the composition of supercomplex In + IIIn + IVn is well conserved in various mouse and human cell lines. Strikingly, we found that a minimal supercomplex In + IIIn, termed \"lowest supercomplex\" (LSC) in this study because of its migration at the lowest position close to complex V dimers in blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was associated with complex IV to form a supercomplex In + IIIn + IVn in some, but not all of the human and mouse cells. In addition, we observed that the 3697G>A mutation in mitochondrial-encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) in one patient with Leigh's disease specifically affected the assembly of supercomplex In + IIIn + IVn containing LSC, leading to decreased cellular respiration and ATP generation. In conclusion, we showed the existence of LSC In + IIIn + IVn and impairment of this supercomplex causes disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Dayan Sun","Sun, Dayan","Li, Bin","Qiu, Ruyi","Fang, Hezhi","Lyu, Jianxin"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17060926","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T13:52:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1466850129,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/926","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27338358?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/6\/926\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4926459","pmid":"27338358","pubdate":"2016-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Cell Type-Specific Modulation of Respiratory Chain Supercomplex Organization","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-typespecific-modulation-respiratory-chain-supercomplex-organization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":6874616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262868,"mean":11.548809314216,"rank":220027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262868,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4999,"mean":2.2803141256503,"rank":3689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":1.9282393617021,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
