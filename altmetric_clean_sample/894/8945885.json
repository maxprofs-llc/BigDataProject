Due to various anthropogenic pressures the natural populations of this important orchid species are presently facing threats of extinction. In the present study, genetic and chemical diversity existing amongst 6 natural populations of D. nobile were assessed using molecular markers, and the influence of genetic factors on its phytochemical activity especially antioxidant potential was determined. Molecular fingerprinting of the orchid taxa was performed using ISSR and DAMD markers along with the estimation of total phenolics, flavonoids and alkaloid contents. Antioxidant activity was also measured using DPPH and FRAP assays which cumulatively revealed a significant level of variability across the sampled populations. The representatives from Sikkim in Northeast India revealed higher phytochemical activity whereas those from Mizoram showed lesser activity. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that variation amongst the populations was significantly higher than within the populations. The data generated by UPGMA and Bayesian analytical models were compared in order to estimate the genetic relationships amongst the D. nobile germplasm sampled from different geographical areas of Northeast India. Interestingly, identical grouping patterns were exhibited by both the approaches. The results of the present study detected a high degree of existing genetic and phytochemical variation amongst the populations in relation to bioclimatic and geographic locations of populations. Our results strongly establish that the cumulative marker approach could be the best suited for assessing the genetic relationships with high accuracy amongst distinct D. nobile accessions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003327","authors":["Bhattacharyya, Paromik","Kumaria, Suman","Tandon, Pramod"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phytochem.2015.06.022","endpage":"316","first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T10:06:49+00:00","issns":["1873-3700","00319422"],"journal":"Phytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1466503327,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26125940?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26125940","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"306","subjects":["chemistry","botany"],"title":"Applicability of ISSR and DAMD markers for phyto-molecular characterization and association with some important biochemical traits of Dendrobium nobile, an endangered medicinal orchid","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applicability-issr-damd-markers-phytomolecular-characterization-association-some-important-biochemic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6010468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1065221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262700,"mean":11.547018085337,"rank":184072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262700,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1519,"mean":3.032906455863,"rank":1176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1519,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.88333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
