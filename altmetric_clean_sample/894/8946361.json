The lesion first developed 5 years ago as a small solitary white nodule and subsequently enlarged over the past 2 years. His medical history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed a 2-cm round to oval dome-shaped yellowish nodule with a dimple on the top center (Figure 1). No similar lesions were found elsewhere. With a clinical suspicion of sebaceous carcinoma, an excision of the lesion was performed under local anesthesia. The histopathologic analysis showed an epidermal cyst containing molluscum bodies along the keratin inside the cyst (Figure 2). With these findings, the diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum (MC) infection into an epidermoid cyst was made. Neither recurrence nor new similar lesions were observed at follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008945","authors":["Husein-ElAhmed, Husein","Ruiz-Molina, Inmaculada","C\u00edvico-Amat, Vicente","Sol\u00eds-Garc\u00eda, Eduardo"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-21T10:33:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1540-9740"],"issue":"2","journal":"SKINmed","last_mentioned_on":1466504301,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27319966?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27319966","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Molluscum Contagiosum Infection Involving a Benign Epidermoid Cyst in an Immunocompetent Patient.","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262700,"mean":11.547008759074,"rank":219994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262700,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.9755696202532,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/745199169065803777","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8946361],"posted_on":"2016-06-21T10:18:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
