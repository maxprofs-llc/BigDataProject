Central to initiation of the UPR is the activation of the ER transmembrane kinase protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Here we report that the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 and protein disulfide isomerase-A1 (PDI), which belong to the same family of luminal ER oxidoreductases, have strikingly opposing roles in the regulation of PERK function. In HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, lentiviral depletion of ERp57 resulted in oxidation of PDI and activation of PERK, whereas depletion or chemical inhibition of PDI reduced PERK signaling and sensitized the cancer cells to hypoxia and ER stress. We conclude that oxidized PDI acts as a PERK activator, whereas ERp57 keeps PDI in a reduced state in the absence of ER stress. Thus, our study defines a new interface between metabolic redox signaling and PERK-dependent activation of the UPR and has the potential to influence future cancer therapies that target PERK signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["Kranz, Philip","Neumann, Fabian","Wolf, Alexandra","Classen, Fabian","Pompsch, Mosche","Ocklenburg, Tobias","Baumann, Jennifer","Janke, Kirsten","Baumann, Melanie","Goepelt, Kirsten","Riffkin, Helena","Metzen, Eric","Brockmeier, Ulf"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2017.369","first_seen_on":"2017-08-11T18:23:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2041-4889"],"issue":"8","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1502615603,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28796255?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28796255","pubdate":"2017-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"PDI is an essential redox-sensitive activator of PERK during the unfolded protein response (UPR)","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pdi-essential-redoxsensitive-activator-perk-during-unfolded-protein-response-upr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.45,"6m":2.45,"3m":2.45,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":3475261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4882945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184848,"mean":12.491550752785,"rank":67310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":117185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184848,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1568,"mean":5.4770631780472,"rank":820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1568,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":2.6266666666667,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/896074519642755072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23631555],"posted_on":"2017-08-11T18:23:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":415},"tweet_id":"896074519642755072"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MarciniakLab\/statuses\/896095248715087873","license":"gnip","rt":["hypoxiapapers"],"citation_ids":[23631555],"posted_on":"2017-08-11T19:45:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Marciniak Lab","url":"http:\/\/www.med.cam.ac.uk\/marciniak\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/683205906423771136\/0-BITGpy_normal.jpg","description":"Professor of Respiratory Science at the University of Cambridge.
