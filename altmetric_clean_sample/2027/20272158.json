Two reasons account for their growing popularity: relatively low cost and simplicity, allowing almost any person to enjoy the sport of flying, which was unattainable for most just a few years ago. Unfortunately, inexperienced pilots and relatively new and unproven aircraft have been brought together to create a potentially lethal combination. On average, 60 deaths per year occur in the U.S. due to ultralight crashes, a number that will undoubtedly rise in the future. The U.S. and Canada have very few regulations covering the licensing of pilots or the design and construction of ultralight aircraft. The North American safety record is inferior to that of countries that have implemented stricter, more far-reaching regulations. Stricter pilot certification and enforced regulations governing design and construction of ultralight aircraft would improve the safety record of this sport. Ultralight aircraft crashes and their associated injuries came to our attention recently through the presentation of three cases of isolated fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in such crashes. Spinal fractures due to ultralight crashes have no unique features that separate them from those of other trauma victims. Physicians must, however, have a high index of suspicion for spinal injuries in these victims.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ad1","authors":["Zwimpfer, T J","Gertzbein, S G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T19:14:34+00:00","issns":["0022-5282"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Trauma","last_mentioned_on":1495134860,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3573093"],"pmid":"3573093","pubdate":"1987-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Ultralight aircraft crashes: their increasing incidence and associated fractures of the thoracolumbar spine.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultralight-aircraft-crashes-increasing-incidence-associated-fractures-thoracolumbar-spine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4373685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2283060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234029,"mean":12.379157126498,"rank":129643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234029,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1567,"mean":5.309711366539,"rank":1243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1567,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
