However, the contribution of energy expenditure to these relationships has not been well characterised. In this exploratory analysis, data from three laboratory trials that standardised test meals, cohort characteristics (overweight\/obese, sedentary), and break frequency and duration were pooled. Higher energy expenditures of different types of breaks (standing, light- or moderate-intensity walking) were associated with lower post-prandial glucose and insulin responses in a dose-dependent manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ceb","authors":[" Robyn N.
