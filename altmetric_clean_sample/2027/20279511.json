Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\u2029.\n13 nurses with a range of credentials and experience, representing infusion, medical oncology, and bone marrow transplantation clinics.\u2029.\nTwo focus groups were conducted. Theoretical thematic content analysis of data was performed.\u2029.\nKey themes that emerged for consideration of electronic portals included work volume and flow, patient expectations and safety, variation in use of communication technologies, and education and management.\u2029.\nThe current study provides insight into the implications of electronic portals by identifying nursing staff reactions to this technology. These reactions are predominantly related to the impact on clinical workload and patient safety and expectations.\u2029.\nAs clinical cancer facilities incorporate electronic portal technology into their operations, attention to the impact on staff workload, division of labor, patient safety, and patient expectations should be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003242","authors":["Gerber, David E","Shaalan Beg, Muhammad","Duncan, Tobi","Gill, Mary","Craddock Lee, Simon J"],"doi":"10.1188\/17.onf.165-170","first_seen_on":"2017-05-19T02:26:24+00:00","issns":["1538-0688"],"issue":"2","journal":"Oncology Nursing Forum","last_mentioned_on":1495162000,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28222081"],"pmid":"28222081","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"Oncology Nursing Perceptions of Patient Electronic Portal Use: A Qualitative Analysis.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncology-nursing-perceptions-patient-electronic-portal-qualitative-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":4377306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2284774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233773,"mean":12.34869915131,"rank":129662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233773,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":3.4565581395349,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.15,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ShaalanBeg\/statuses\/865393072477044737","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20279511],"posted_on":"2017-05-19T02:26:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Shaalan Beg","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/shaalanbeg","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/603635833384509440\/PieMcJRi_normal.jpg","description":"GI oncologist.
