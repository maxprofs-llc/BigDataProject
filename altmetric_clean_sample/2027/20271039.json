However, to date, there are few reports on the use of any of the current genome editing approaches in grape-an important fruit crop with a large market not only for table grapes but also for wine. Here, we report successful targeted mutagenesis in grape (Vitis vinifera L., cv. Neo Muscat) using the CRISPR\/Cas9 system. When a Cas9 expression construct was transformed to embryonic calli along with a synthetic sgRNA expression construct targeting the Vitis vinifera phytoene desaturase (VvPDS) gene, regenerated plants with albino leaves were obtained. DNA sequencing confirmed that the VvPDS gene was mutated at the target site in regenerated grape plants. Interestingly, the ratio of mutated cells was higher in lower, older, leaves compared to that in newly appearing upper leaves. This result might suggest either that the proportion of targeted mutagenized cells is higher in older leaves due to the repeated induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), or that the efficiency of precise DSBs repair in cells of old grape leaves is decreased.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ikuko Nakajima","Yusuke Ban","Akifumi Azuma","Noriyuki Onoue","Takaya Moriguchi","Toshiya Yamamoto","Seiichi Toki","Masaki Endo"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0177966","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T18:16:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1495960840,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0177966","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0177966"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0177966&type=printable","pmid":"28542349","pubdate":"2017-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis in grape","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crisprcas9mediated-targeted-mutagenesis-grape"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":3585556,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4579206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239947,"mean":12.284449767864,"rank":97233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":138866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239947,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114661,"mean":10.593387912088,"rank":48564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":63289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114661,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4209,"mean":10.240524714829,"rank":1599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4209,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
