We used solution calorimetry and periodic DFT calculations to analyze thermodynamics of two families of topologically-distinct polymorphs of zinc zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) based on 2-methyl- and 2-ethylimidazolate linkers, demonstrating a correlation between measured thermodynamic stability and density, and a pronounced effect of the ligand substituent on their stability. The results show that mechanochemical syntheses and transformations of ZIFs are consistent with Ostwald's rule of stages and proceed to-ward thermodynamically increasingly stable, more dense phases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zamirbek Akimbekov","Athanassios D.
