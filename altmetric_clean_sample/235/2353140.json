However, the regulatory influence of ETA-mediated vasoconstriction during exercise in the elderly is unknown. Thus, in 17 healthy volunteers (n = 8 young, 24\u00b12 years; n = 9 old, 70\u00b12 years), we examined leg blood flow, mean arterial pressure, leg arterial-venous oxygen (O2) difference, and leg O2 consumption (VO2) at rest and during knee-extensor exercise before and after intra-arterial administration of the ETA antagonist BQ-123. During exercise, BQ-123 administration increased leg blood flow to a greater degree in the old (+29\u00b15 mL\/min\/W) compared with the young (+16\u00b13 mL\/min\/W). The increase in leg blood flow with BQ-123 was accompanied by an increase in leg VO2 in both groups, suggesting a reduced efficiency following ETA receptor blockade. Together, these findings have identified an age-related increase in ETA-mediated vasoconstrictor activity that persists during exercise, suggesting an important role of this pathway in the regulation of exercising skeletal muscle blood flow and maintenance of arterial blood pressure in the elderly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Zachary Barrett-O'Keefe","Stephen J Ives","Joel D Trinity","Garrett Morgan","Matthew J Rossman","Anthony J Donato","Sean Runnels","David E Morgan","Benjamin S Gmelch","Amber D Bledsoe","Russell S Richardson","D Walter Wray"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/glu065","first_seen_on":"2014-05-15T11:00:53+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1758-535X"],"journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1400151636,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24821105"],"pmid":"24821105","pubdate":"2014-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Endothelin-A-Mediated Vasoconstriction During Exercise With Advancing Age.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endothelina-mediated-vasoconstriction-during-exercise-advancing-age"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108092,"mean":7.6814052788856,"rank":72825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108092,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":994,"mean":5.4420926485398,"rank":729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":994,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":6.7518181818182,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
