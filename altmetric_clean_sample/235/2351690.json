It's also required in a wide range of biological systems to act modulating the proliferation and inducing terminal differentiation of a variety of normal cells. Actually vitamin D deficiency can impact muscle function and increases fall risk in elderly, while severe vitamin D deficiency (< 30 nmol\/L) is common in patients with fragility fractures. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation, in addition to antiosteoporosis treatment after surgery or conservative treatment, can ensure optimal recovery and survival, especially in hip fractured patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf0","authors":["Giovanni Iolascon, MD","G Di Pietro, MD","F Gimigliano, MD, PhD"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T20:47:22+00:00","issns":["1724-8914"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Cases in Mineral and Bone Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1491581022,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2781221\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2781221\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2781221","pmid":"22461160","pubdate":"2017-04-07T16:03:57+00:00","publisher":"CIC Edizioni Internazionali","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"120","title":"Vitamin D supplementation in fractured patient: how, when and why","type":"article","volume":"6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":1986005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4922705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177576,"mean":7.262781945657,"rank":46272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":126643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177576,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.2429761904762,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PEAKSurg\/status\/466681132549808129","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2351690],"posted_on":"2014-05-14T20:47:07+00:00","author":{"name":"PEAK Surg.
