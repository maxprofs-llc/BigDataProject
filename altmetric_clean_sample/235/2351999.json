Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is critical for oncogenic Ras OIS, but the downstream effectors to mediate ROS signaling are still relatively elusive. Senescent cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the SASP are largely unknown. Here, we identify protein kinase D1 (PKD1) as a downstream effector of ROS signaling to mediate Ras OIS and SASP. PKD1 is activated by oncogenic Ras expression and PKD1 promotes Ras OIS by mediating inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) via modulation of NF-\u03baB activity. We demonstrate that ROS-protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4)-PKD1 axis is essential for the establishment and maintenance of IL-6\/IL8 induction. In addition, ablation of PKD1 causes the bypass of Ras OIS, and promotes cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Together, these findings uncover a previously unidentified role of ROS-PKC\u03b4-PKD1 pathway in Ras OIS and SASP regulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Pan Wang","Limin Han","Hong Shen","Pengfeng Wang","Cuicui Lv","Ganye Zhao","Jing Niu","Lixiang Xue","Qiming Jane Wang","Tanjun Tong","Jun Chen"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1310972111","first_seen_on":"2014-05-15T00:04:56+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1409754131,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/14\/1310972111.abstract","http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/14\/1310972111","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24828530?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/14\/1310972111.full.pdf","pmid":"24828530","pubdate":"2014-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"201310972","subjects":["science"],"title":"Protein kinase D1 is essential for Ras-induced senescence and tumor suppression by regulating senescence-associated inflammation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-kinase-d1-essential-rasinduced-senescence-tumor-suppression-regulating-senescenceassociated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4212055,"mean":5.1290379762681,"rank":309305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3899370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4212055,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103614,"mean":7.6786283574455,"rank":10933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":92589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103614,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36448,"mean":14.514398112328,"rank":7514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":28864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36448,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":937,"mean":40.457412393162,"rank":390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":937,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
