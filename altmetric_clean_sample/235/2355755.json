Analysis of the data showed that dose of valproate, but not intake of other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, in the current pregnancy, and a past history of a pregnancy involving a malformed foetus, statistically significantly increased the malformation hazard in the current pregnancy, and that continuing alcohol intake might decrease it. Plotting the hazard against valproate dose in monotherapy, with or without histories of (i) previous pregnancies with foetal malformations (FMs), and (ii) continuing alcohol intake, provided quantitative information concerning the degree of increased risk. It is hoped that this information may help in advising about the risk of foetal malformation (FM) in individual pregnancies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f7","authors":["Vajda FJ","O'Brien TJ","Graham J","Lander CM","Eadie MJ","F.J.E.
