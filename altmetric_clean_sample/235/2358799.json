The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of VDR gene polymorphisms with melanoma risk, clinicopathological characteristics, and vitamin D levels. The study group included 117 patients (84 patients with superficial spreading melanoma and 33 patients with nodular melanoma). The control group included 122 sex-matched and age-matched healthy-blood donors of the same ethnicity. VDR gene polymorphisms FokI, EcoRV, TaqI, and ApaI were genotyped by real-time PCR. In 60 patients, the total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were evaluated in serum samples by direct chemiluminescence. Associations among parameters were considered to be significant if the P value was less than 0.05. Significant differences in the frequencies of VDR genotypes were observed between cases and the control group for FokI and TaqI polymorphisms (P<0.0001; P=0.005, respectively). Heterozygous Ff as well as mutant FF genotypes of the FokI polymorphism were associated with increased melanoma risk compared with the wild-type form [odds ratio (OR)=3.035, P=0.003; OR=9.276, P<0.0001, respectively]. A significantly increased melanoma risk was observed for the heterozygous Tt (OR=2.302, P=0.011) and the mutated variant tt (OR=3.697, P=0.003) of the TaqI polymorphism in comparison with the wild-type genotype. None of the polymorphisms studied was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and vitamin D serum level. Our results suggest that FokI and TaqI polymorphisms in the VDR gene may be considered as potential biomarkers for melanoma susceptibility. Low vitamin D levels in melanoma patients indicate the need for vitamin D supplementation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f61000815e","doi":"10.1097\/cmr.0000000000000065","first_seen_on":"2014-05-17T18:51:46+00:00","issns":["0960-8931"],"issue":"3","journal":"Melanoma Research","last_mentioned_on":1401790168,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/melanomaresearch\/Abstract\/2014\/06000\/Melanoma_risk_is_associated_with_vitamin_D.11.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24638155"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/melanomaresearch\/2014\/06000\/Melanoma_risk_is_associated_with_vitamin_D.11.pdf","pmid":"24638155","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"273","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Melanoma risk is associated with vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/melanoma-risk-associated-vitamin-d-receptor-gene-polymorphisms-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2905118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1448333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106758,"mean":7.7246865872966,"rank":68719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":34698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106758,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":1.617046728972,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3136363636364,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Melanoma risk is associated with vitamin D rece...
