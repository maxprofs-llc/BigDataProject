Older adolescents and young adults are particularly impacted by these deficits. Preclinical data implicate glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ASDs. D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial glycineB agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor site, has been shown to improve sociability in mouse models and a small human study. The sensitivity of the obligatory glycineB co-agonist binding site may change with daily administration of DCS as a result of agonist-induced desensitization. The efficacy of a \"pulsed\" once-weekly administration versus \"daily\" administration of DCS was compared.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f0e","authors":["Maria Urbano","Leonore Okwara","Paul Manser","Kathrin Hartmann","Amy Herndon","Stephen I Deutsch","Stephen I.
