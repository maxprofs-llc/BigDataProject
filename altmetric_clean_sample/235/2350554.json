In this study, we show that piperine (75-150\u2009\u00b5M) inhibited the growth of several colon cancer cell lines but had little effect on the growth of normal fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Piperine inhibited HT-29 colon carcinoma cell proliferation by causing G1 phase cell cycle arrest that was associated with decreased expression of cyclins D1 and D3 and their activating partner cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, as well as reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and up-regulation of p21\/WAF1 and p27\/KIP1 expression. In addition, piperine caused hydroxyl radical production and apoptosis that was partially dependent on the production of reactive oxygen species. Piperine-treated HT-29 cells showed loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, as well as caspase activation and reduced apoptosis in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK. Increased expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated proteins inositol-requiring 1\u03b1 protein, C\/EBP homologous protein, and binding immunoglobulin protein, and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, as well as decreased phosphorylation of Akt and reduced survivin expression were also observed in piperine-treated HT-29 cells. Furthermore, piperine inhibited colony formation by HT-29 cells, as well as the growth of HT-29 spheroids. Cell cycle arrest and endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis following piperine treatment of HT-29 cells provides the first evidence that piperine may be useful in the treatment of colon cancer. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e1","authors":["Yaffe PB","Power Coombs MR","Doucette CD","Walsh M","Hoskin DW","Yaffe, Paul B.","Power Coombs, Melanie R.","Doucette, Carolyn D.","Walsh, Mark","Hoskin, David W."],"doi":"10.1002\/mc.22176","endpage":"1085","first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T13:04:47+00:00","issns":["1098-2744","0899-1987"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecular Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1436289061,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mc.22176\/abstract;jsessionid=F19BC641E22C4760B8A8C84C219338B8.f01t03","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24819444"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mc.22176\/pdf","pmid":"24819444","pubdate":"2014-05-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1070","subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Piperine, an alkaloid from black pepper, inhibits growth of human colon cancer cells via G1 arrest and apoptosis triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/piperine-alkaloid-black-pepper-inhibits-growth-human-colon-cancer-cells-via-g1-arrest-apoptosis-trig-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6306418,"mean":5.9759110537734,"rank":4432326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1647017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6306418,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143263,"mean":7.7131341877122,"rank":89168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":48394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143263,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":404,"mean":2.4632555831266,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":404,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.15,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
