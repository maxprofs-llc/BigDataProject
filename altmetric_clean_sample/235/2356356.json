Here we studied the role of ATP in this process focusing on Ca(2+) current through CaV1.3 channels and Ca(2+) homeostasis in mouse inner hair cells. Patch-clamp recordings and Ca(2+) imaging demonstrate that hydrolyzable ATP is essential to maintain synaptic Ca(2+) influx in inner hair cells via fueling Ca(2+)-ATPases to avoid an increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and subsequent Ca(2+)\/calmodulin-dependent inactivation of CaV1.3 channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Simon Weiler","Stefanie Krinner","Aaron B Wong","Tobias Moser","Tina Pangr\u0161i\u010d"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.4990-13.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-05-16T12:38:51+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"20","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1400243863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24828638?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24828638","pubdate":"2014-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"ATP Hydrolysis Is Critically Required for Function of CaV1.3 Channels in Cochlear Inner Hair Cells via Fueling Ca2+ Clearance.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atp-hydrolysis-critically-required-function-cav13-channels-cochlear-inner-hair-cells-via-fueling-ca2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3752296,"mean":4.9887728099166,"rank":2091923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":966470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3752296,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95302,"mean":7.2413386008542,"rank":49824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":24843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95302,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9267,"mean":6.2199050291388,"rank":5112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9267,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329,"mean":11.613256097561,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
