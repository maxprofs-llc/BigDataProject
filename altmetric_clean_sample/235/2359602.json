Natick, MA) showed small variation and correct estimation of bead concentration. All the reusable chambers gave relatively large variability, with tendency to underestimate (improved Neubauer; Hawksley, Lancing, United Kingdom) or to overestimate the bead concentration. The use of plunger-displacement pipettes resulted in an overestimation of bead concentration in medium but not in seminal plasma. Counting the sperm suspension using plunger-displacement pipettes indicated that the B\u00fcrker hemocytometer overestimated concentration relative to that obtained by Cellvision and Makler Counting Chambers (Sefi Medical Instruments, Haifa, Israel) and that the improved Neubauer presented the lowest variability (7.1%).\nThe improved Neubauer hemocytometer is the standard for sperm counting, though disposable chambers give reliable results as well. If beads are used to evaluate the accuracy of counting chambers, it is recommended to dilute them with seminal plasma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Ahmed M.A. Mahmoud","Birgit Depoorter","Nadine Piens","Frank H.
