To investigate the ergogenic effect of an acute inhalation of short acting \u03b22-agonists at doses up to 1600 \u00b5g on 5 km time trial performance and resultant urine concentration. Seven male non-asthmatic runners (mean \u00b1 SD; age 22.4 \u00b1 4.3 years; height 1.80 \u00b1 0.07 m; body mass 76.6 \u00b1 8.6 kg) provided written informed consent. Participants completed six 5 km time-trials on separate days (three at 18 \u00b0C and three at 30 \u00b0C). Fifteen minutes prior to the initiation of each 5 km time-trial participants inhaled: placebo (PLA), 800 \u00b5g salbutamol (SAL800) or 1600 \u00b5g salbutamol (SAL1600). During each 5 km time-trial HR, VO2, VCO2, VE, RPE and blood lactate were measured. Urine samples (90 ml) were collected between 30-180 minutes post 5 km time-trial and analysed for salbutamol concentration. There was no significant difference in total 5 km time between treatments (PLA 1714.7 \u00b1 186.2 s; SAL800 1683.3 \u00b1 179.7 s; SAL1600 1683.6 \u00b1 190.7 s). Post 5 km time-trial salbutamol urine concentration between SAL800 (122.96 \u00b1 69.22 ug\u00b7ml(-1)) and SAL1600 (574.06 \u00b1 448.17 ug\u00b7ml(-1)) were not significantly different. There was no improvement in 5 km time-trial performance following the inhalation of up to 1600 \u00b5g of salbutamol in non-asthmatic athletes. This would suggest that the current WADA guidelines, which allow athletes to inhale up to 1600 \u00b5g per day, is sufficient to avoid pharmaceutical induced performance enhancement. Key pointsInhaling up to 1600 \u00b5g of Salbutamol does not result in improved 5 km time trial performance.The position of Salbutamol on the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited appears justified.Athletes who use up to 1600 \u00b5g Salbutamol in one day need to review their therapy as it would suggest their respiratory condition is not under control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f38","authors":["John Dickinson","Jiu Hu","Neil Chester","Mike Loosemore","Greg Whyte"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T13:50:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Sports Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1491912541,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3990879\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24790479"],"pmid":"24790479","pubdate":"2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dept. of Sports Medicine, Medical Faculty of Uludag University","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"271","title":"Acute Impact of Inhaled Short Acting B<sub>2<\/sub>-Agonists on 5 Km Running Performance.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-impact-inhaled-short-acting-b2agonists-5-km-running-performance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.05,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":8,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8058252,"mean":6.8390091159945,"rank":330784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7727227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8058252,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178249,"mean":7.3588357681434,"rank":9301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":168939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178249,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":382,"mean":6.4680262467192,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":382,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":13.186363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
