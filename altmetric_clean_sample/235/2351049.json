The complete genomic constellation of the CAU12-2-51 strain revealed a novel genotype constellation for human rotavirus, G3-P[9]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T3-E3-H3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CAU12-2-51 strain originated from feline- and bovine-like reassortment strains. The genes encoding VP4, VP7, NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 were related to human\/feline-like and feline rotavirus strains, whereas the remaining five genes encoding VP1, VP2, VP3, VP6, and NSP2 were related to the human\/bovine-like and bovine rotavirus strains. This novel strain was identified for the first time, providing evidence of feline\/bovine-to-human transmission of rotavirus. The data presented herein provide information regarding rotavirus diversity and evolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sunyoung Jeong","Van Thai Than","Inseok Lim","Wonyong Kim"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0097127","first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T16:08:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1400757298,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24818762?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097127"],"pmid":"24818762","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Whole-Genome Analysis of a Rare Human Korean G3P Rotavirus Strain Suggests a Complex Evolutionary Origin Potentially Involving Reassortment Events between Feline and Bovine Rotaviruses.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholegenome-analysis-rare-human-korean-g3p9-rotavirus-strain-suggests-complex-evolutionary-origin-po"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124480,"mean":7.9213776460288,"rank":61478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":46542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124480,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88917,"mean":9.2646352737416,"rank":50885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":27796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88917,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3201,"mean":11.592598125,"rank":1898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3201,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
