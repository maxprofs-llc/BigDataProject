Noticeably, a similar antimicrobial action and potency are also noticed toward a few methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains but not toward Escherichia coli. The time and concentration dependencies of the antimicrobial actions of AF have been characterized through recording time kill curves, and a concentration dependent profile highlighted. Overall, the present results point out that auranofin might be quickly and successfully repurposed for the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to resistant Staphylococci.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c82","authors":["Cassetta MI","Marzo T","Fallani S","Novelli A","Messori L"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10534-014-9743-6","first_seen_on":"2014-05-16T18:31:55+00:00","issns":["0966-0844"],"issue":"","journal":"BioMetals","last_mentioned_on":1400266873,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24820140?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24820140","pubdate":"2014-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Drug repositioning: auranofin as a prospective antimicrobial agent for the treatment of severe staphylococcal infections.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drug-repositioning-auranofin-prospective-antimicrobial-agent-treatment-severe-staphylococcal-infecti-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3752296,"mean":4.9887728099166,"rank":2840877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":747463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3752296,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95302,"mean":7.2413438473888,"rank":71988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95302,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":1.9406040268456,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.8375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsainfection\/status\/467371668537487360","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2357141],"posted_on":"2014-05-16T18:31:03+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA INFECTION","url":"http:\/\/www.mrsainfection.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222048374\/MRSA_6_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA Information","id_on_source":"mrsainfection","tweeter_id":"36626253","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":728},"tweet_id":"467371668537487360"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsawatch\/status\/467379260710088705","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2357141],"posted_on":"2014-05-16T19:01:13+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA Watch","url":"http:\/\/tahilla.typepad.com\/mrsawatch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222035691\/MRSA_9_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA News","id_on_source":"mrsawatch","tweeter_id":"41137185","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":1138},"tweet_id":"467379260710088705"}]}}
