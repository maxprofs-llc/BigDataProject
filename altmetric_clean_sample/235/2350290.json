We evaluated IMS acceptability and to which extent participants represented the Swedish population. We also studied the agreement of data on influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrence from IMS with data from a previously evaluated population-based system (PBS) with an actively recruited random sample of the population who spontaneously report disease onsets in real-time via telephone\/Internet, and with traditional general practitioner based sentinel and virological influenza surveillance, in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. We assessed acceptability by calculating the participation proportion in an invited IMS-sample and the weekly reporting proportion of enrolled self-recruited IMS participants. We compared distributions of socio-demographic indicators of self-recruited IMS participants to the general Swedish population using chi-square tests. Finally, we assessed the agreement of weekly incidence proportions (%) of ILI in IMS and PBS with cross-correlation analyses. Among 2,511 invited persons, 166 (6.6%) agreed to participate in the IMS. In each season, 2,552 and 2,486 self-recruited persons participated in the IMS respectively. The weekly reporting proportion among self-recruited participants decreased from 87% to 23% (2011-2012) and 82% to 45% (2012-2013). Women, highly educated, and middle-aged persons were overrepresented among self-recruited IMS participants (p<0.01). IMS (invited and self-recruited) and PBS weekly incidence proportions correlated strongest when no lags were applied (r = 0.71 and r = 0.69, p<0.05). This evaluation revealed socio-demographic misrepresentation and limited compliance among the self-recruited IMS participants. Yet, IMS offered a reasonable representation of the temporal ILI pattern in the community overall during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons and could be a simple tool for collecting community-based ILI data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Moa Rehn","AnnaSara Carnahan","Hanna Merk","Sharon K\u00fchlmann-Berenzon","Ilias Galanis","Annika Linde","Olof Nyr\u00e9n"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0096740","first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T11:05:58+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1420712763,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0096740","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24824806?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24824806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24824806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0096740.pdf","pmid":"24824806","pubdate":"2014-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e96740","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evaluation of an internet-based monitoring system for influenza-like illness in sweden.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-internetbased-monitoring-system-influenzalike-illness-sweden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":1110136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3916507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124980,"mean":7.8855090055133,"rank":30421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":94296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124980,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88893,"mean":9.2571394951179,"rank":24496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":64079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88893,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3200,"mean":11.606531416068,"rank":961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3200,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
