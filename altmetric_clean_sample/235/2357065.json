The present cycloisomerization may involve site selective \u03b3-hydrogen elimination. The one-pot enantioselective cycloisomerization and lactonization of 1,6-enynes, leading to bicyclic lactones, has also been accomplished.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Koji Masutomi","Keiichi Noguchi","Ken Tanaka"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja504048u","first_seen_on":"2014-05-16T17:53:19+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1400314675,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja504048u"],"pmid":"24823870","pubdate":"2014-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"140516094901000","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Enantioselective Cycloisomerization of 1,6-Enynes to Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes Catalyzed by Rhodium and Benzoic Acid","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enantioselective-cycloisomerization-16enynes-bicyclo310hexanes-catalyzed-rhodium-benzoic-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508612,"mean":5.1916753366762,"rank":2130177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2250318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508612,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107351,"mean":7.8233459897533,"rank":47361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":56178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107351,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1001544226917,"rank":8837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":6.0430752212389,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
