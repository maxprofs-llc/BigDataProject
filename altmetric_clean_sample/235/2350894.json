The development of the techniques of lobar and bilateral lobar transplantation has shown that lung morphology may adapt to the shape of the thorax. Thus, variations in implantation have become possible. We describe a case of a 30-year-old man with severe bronchiectasis due to ciliary dyskinesis which required a left lower lobectomy at the age of 11 years and a left completion pneumonectomy 10 years later. His disease progressed and he was listed for a right lung transplantation. At the time of transplantation, the donor right lung was noted to be edematous and unfit for transplantation. This required grafting the donor left lung in the right thorax of the recipient. Follow-up at 7 years shows good exercise capacity and excellent functional tests without evidence of rejection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Couetil, J P","Argyriadis, P G","Tolan, M J","Achkar, A","Carpentier, A F"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0003-4975(01)02394-3","first_seen_on":"2014-05-14T15:10:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00034975","0003-4975"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1400080174,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003497501023943"],"pmid":"11565693","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Contralateral lung transplantation: a left lung implanted in the right thorax","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contralateral-lung-transplantation-left-lung-implanted-right-thorax"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108056,"mean":7.6848126972378,"rank":72814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":23925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108056,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2174,"mean":1.8292508053382,"rank":937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2174,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":0.93525301204819,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
