However, there is little research on how older adults perceive support from neighbors in terms of helping them to remain in their own homes and communities safely and comfortably, particularly in the face of later life challenges. There also is little systematic study of ways in which community initiatives might influence these relationships.\nQualitative interviews were conducted with 41 older adults from seven Naturally Occurring Retirement Community Supportive Service Program (NORC program) catchment areas in the greater New York City area. A grounded theory approach was used to identify themes and develop an empirically grounded account of NORC programs, support among neighbors, and aging in place.\nParticipants identified several ways in which NORC programs influenced support among neighbors, such as by serving as a conduit for information sharing and helping older adults to broaden their private networks of social relationships. Overall, however, participants more consistently described limitations of the NORC programs' influence on support within these relationships. Participants also described how other sources of support were necessary in addition to support from neighbors to help people overcome major challenges to aging in place.\nResults suggest the importance of neighbors-helping-neighbors approaches to promote aging in place as a complement, rather than substitute, to other efforts, such as those that focus on enhancing access to formal providers and strengthening care within families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000296d","authors":["Greenfield, Emily A","Emily A.
