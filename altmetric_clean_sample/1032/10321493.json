Statistical analyses included chi-square and one-way analysis of variance with post hoc multiple comparisons using the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences.\nThe study participants included 234 first and second year community college students. Nearly 91% of them were sexually active and 95% reported healthy sexual attitudes. However, only 29% reported adhering to consistent condom use. More females believed that condoms should always be used, even if the two people knew each other very well, when compared to males (P=0.04). Hispanic female participants were less confident they could abstain from sex when compared to non-Hispanics (P=0.00). Non-Hispanic females were more confident they could use or explain to their partner how to use a condom correctly and go to the store to buy condoms than their Hispanic female (P=0.01) and male counterparts (P=0.00).\nOur study findings indicate that adherence to consistent condom use was low among Hispanic college students. This may help explain why they are more likely to report unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. There is a documented need to introduce culturally sensitive health promotion programming specifically designed to meet the needs of this at-risk and understudied population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc71","authors":["Yelena Bird","Luis Solis","Chinaedu Mbonu","Luis H Solis","Chinaedu Anulika Mbonu"],"doi":"10.2147\/ppa.s108688","endpage":"1508","first_seen_on":"2016-08-08T03:03:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-889X"],"journal":"Patient preference and adherence","last_mentioned_on":1474325123,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/sexual-attitudes-norms-condom-use-and-adherence-of-hispanic-and-non-hi-peer-reviewed-article-PPA","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4981160\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31755","pmid":"27540282","pubdate":"2016-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1501","title":"Sexual attitudes, norms, condom use, and adherence of Hispanic and non-Hispanic undergraduate students: a cross-sectional study of three community colleges in southwestern US","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-attitudes-norms-condom-adherence-hispanic-nonhispanic-undergraduate-students-crosssectional-s-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":1754182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6641918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259876,"mean":12.022935426647,"rank":68550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":190902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259876,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":813,"mean":4.4766748768473,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":813,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":3.5428767123288,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePatient\/statuses\/762484393290063873","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10321493],"posted_on":"2016-08-08T03:03:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Patient","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=23","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294760240\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of patient care, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePatient","tweeter_id":"53258840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"762484393290063873"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dyl_does\/statuses\/762516852639539200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10321493],"posted_on":"2016-08-08T05:12:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Dyl Does","url":"http:\/\/www.dyldoes.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/638156896482889728\/uecWBM50_normal.jpg","description":"Your source for anything and everything related to sex that is published in the news.
