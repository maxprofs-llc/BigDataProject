Cronbach's \u03b1 was used to assess the internal consistency of the items used in the index.\nThe result shows that the coverage gap is highest in Uttar Pradesh (37%) and lowest in Madhya Pradesh (21%). Converge gap and socioeconomic development are negatively correlated (r=-0.49, p=0.01). The average coverage gap was highest in the lowest quintile of socioeconomic development. There was an absolute change of 1.5% per year in coverage gap during 2009-2013. In regression analysis, the coefficient of determination was 0.24, \u03b2=-30.05, p=0.01 for a negative relationship between socioeconomic development and coverage gap.\nThere is a significant disparity in the usage of maternal and child healthcare services in the districts of India. Resource-rich people (urban residents and richest quintile) are way ahead of marginalised people (rural residents and poorest quintile) in the usage of healthcare services.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Ashish Awasthi","C M Pandey","Rajesh K Chauhan","Uttam Singh"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-009885","first_seen_on":"2016-08-08T10:09:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"8","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1505133665,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/8\/e009885.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/8\/e009885"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/8\/e009885.full.pdf","pmid":"27496225","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e009885","title":"Disparity in maternal, newborn and child health services in high focus states in India: a district-level cross-sectional analysis","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disparity-maternal-newborn-child-health-services-high-focus-states-india-districtlevel-crosssectiona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":3987412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4223657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259844,"mean":12.016193609217,"rank":119127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":132423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259844,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6240,"mean":17.210942458727,"rank":4135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6240,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":17.311989821883,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
