The Controversy about its Impact on\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"The competition between the chess computer Deep Blue and the former chess world champion Garri Kasparov in 1997 was a\u00a0spectacle staged for the media. However, the chess game, like other games, was also a\u00a0test field for artificial intelligence research. On the one hand Deep Blue's victory was called a\u00a0\"milestone\" for AI research, on the other hand, a\u00a0dead end, since the superiority of the chess computer was based on pure computing power and had nothing to do with \"real\" AI.The article questions the premises of these different interpretations and maps Deep Blue and its way of playing chess into the history of AI. This also requires an analysis of the underlying concepts of thinking. Finally, the essay calls for assuming different \"ways of thinking\" for man and computer. Instead of fundamental discussions of concepts of thinking, we should ask about the consequences of the human-machine division of labor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000831c","authors":["He\u00dfler, Martina"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00048-017-0167-6","first_seen_on":"2017-04-09T10:18:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0036-6978","1420-9144"],"journal":"NTM International Journal of History & Ethics of Natural Sciences, Technology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1491733117,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28389682?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28389682","pubdate":"2017-04-09T22:01:47+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"History","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"History of Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"History of Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physics, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["ethics","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Der Erfolg der \u201eDummheit\u201c","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/der-erfolg-der-dummheit-deep-blues-sieg-%C3%BCber-den-schachweltmeister-garri-kasparov-und-der-streit-%C3%BCbe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":6949473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235656,"mean":12.849477889287,"rank":192488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235656,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.9686440677966,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.01,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
