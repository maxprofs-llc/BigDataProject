(Wiedmann M., et al)","Whole-Genome Sequencing of Drug-Resistant Salmonella enterica Isolated from Dairy Cattle and Humans in New York and\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica can be spread from cattle to humans through direct contact with animals shedding Salmonella, as well as through the food chain, making MDR Salmonella a serious threat to human health. The objective of this study was to use whole-genome sequencing to compare antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) S. Typhimurium, Newport, and Dublin isolated from dairy cattle and humans in Washington state and New York state at a genotypic and phenotypic level. A total of 90 isolates were selected for the study (37 Typhimurium, 32 Newport, 21 Dublin). All isolates were tested for phenotypic antibiotic resistance to 12 drugs using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion. AMR genes were detected in the assembled genome of each isolate using nucleotide BLAST and ARG-ANNOT. Genotypic prediction of phenotypic resistance resulted in a mean sensitivity of 97.2 and specificity of 85.2. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resistance was only observed in human isolates (P < 0.05), while resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones was only observed in 6 S. Typhimurium isolated from humans in WA state. S. Newport isolates showed a high degree of AMR profile similarity, regardless of source. S. Dublin isolates from NY state differed from those from WA state based on the presence\/absence of plasmid replicons, as well as phenotypic AMR susceptibility\/non-susceptibility (P < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that distinct factors may contribute to emergence and dispersal of AMR in humans and farm animals in different regions.Importance The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals has been hypothesized to select for AMR Salmonella enterica and associated AMR determinants, which can be transferred to humans through different routes. Previous studies have sought to assess the degree to which AMR livestock- and human-associated Salmonella overlap, as well as the spatial distribution of Salmonella's associated AMR determinants, but have often been limited by the degree of resolution at which isolates can be compared. Here, a comparative genomics study of livestock- and human-associated Salmonella from different regions of the U.S. shows that while many AMR genes and phenotypes were confined to human isolates, overlap between the resistomes of bovine and human-associated Salmonella isolates were observed on numerous occasions, particularly for S. Newport. We have also shown that WGS can be used to reliably predict phenotypic resistance across Salmonella isolated from bovine sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Carroll, Laura M.","Wiedmann, Martin","den Bakker, Henk","Siler, Julie","Warchocki, Steven","Kent, David","Lyalina, Svetlana","Davis, Margaret","Sischo, William","Besser, Thomas","Warnick, Lorin D.","Pereira, Richard V."],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.00140-17","first_seen_on":"2017-04-09T10:18:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0099-2240","1098-5336"],"journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1494896400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28389536?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28389536","http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/03\/AEM.00140-17.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aem.asm.org\/content\/early\/2017\/04\/03\/AEM.00140-17.full.pdf","pmid":"28389536","pubdate":"2017-04-09T22:02:09+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"\n            Whole-Genome Sequencing of Drug-Resistant\n            Salmonella enterica\n            Isolated from Dairy Cattle and Humans in New York and Washington States Reveals Source and Geographic Associations\n          ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wholegenome-sequencing-drugresistant-salmonella-enterica-isolates-dairy-cattle-humans-new-york-washi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.35,"score_history":{"1y":34.35,"6m":34.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":258162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7955173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242406,"mean":13.033456372599,"rank":15857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":226540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242406,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5704,"mean":6.7136847273365,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":5552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5704,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":11.700892086331,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
