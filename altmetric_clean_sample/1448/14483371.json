Field and laboratory experiments showed that a slight decrease in water temperature dramatically reduced the effects of a keystone predator, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, on its principal prey. Ongoing changes in patterns of cold water upwelling, associated with El Nino events and longer term geophysical changes, may thus have far-reaching impacts on the composition and diversity of these rocky intertidal communities.","ads_id":"1999Sci...283.2095S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Eric Sanford","Sanford, "],"doi":"10.1126\/science.283.5410.2095","endpage":"2097","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T04:24:48+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","10959203","00368075"],"issue":"5410","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1506903594,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.283.5410.2095","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10092235"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/283\/5410\/2095.full.pdf","pmid":"10092235","pubdate":"1999-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"2095","subjects":["science"],"title":"Regulation of Keystone Predation by Small Changes in Ocean Temperature","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.283.5410.2095","volume":"283","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-keystone-predation-small-changes-ocean-temperature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":3,"6d":3,"5d":3,"4d":3,"3d":3,"2d":3,"1d":3,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1411667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6967503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284110,"mean":11.946473698474,"rank":66847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":216981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284110,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41965,"mean":33.702942522162,"rank":18956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":22178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41965,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":79.521386956522,"rank":482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":28,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":90,"Student  > Doctoral Student":21,"Student  > Ph.
