BNGR-A24 belongs to the same clade as BNGR-A32 and -A33, which were recently identified as natalisin receptors. Since these three BNGRs share high similarities with known receptors for tachykinin-related peptides (TRPs), we examined whether these BNGRs can function as physiological receptors for five endogenous B. mori TRPs (TK-1-5). In a heterologous expression system, BNGR-A24 acted as a receptor for all five TRPs. In contrast, BNGR-A32 responded only to TK-5, and BNGR-A33 did not respond to any of the TRPs. These findings are consistent with recent studies on the ligand preferences for B. mori natalisins. Furthermore, we evaluated whether the binding of ITPL and TRPs to BNGR-A24 is competitive by using a Ca2+ imaging assay. Concomitant addition of a TRP receptor antagonist, spantide I, reduced the responses of BNGR-A24 not only to TK-4 but also to ITPL. The results of a binding assay using fluorescent-labeled BNGR-A24 and ligands demonstrated that the binding of ITPL to BNGR-A24 was inhibited by TK-4 as well as by spantide I, and vice versa. In addition, the ITPL-induced increase in cGMP levels of BNGR-A24-expressing BmN cells was suppressed by the addition of excess TK-4 or spantide I. The intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP, as second messenger candidates of the TRP signaling, were not altered by the five TRPs, suggesting that these peptides act via different signaling pathways from cAMP and cGMP signaling at least in BmN cells. Taken together, the present findings suggest that ITPL and TRPs are endogenous orthosteric ligands of BNGR-A24 that may activate discrete signaling pathways. This receptor, which shares orthosteric ligands, may constitute an important model for studying ligand-biased signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Chiaki Nagai-Okatani","Hiromichi Nagasawa","Shinji Nagata"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0156501","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T06:25:54+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1500522603,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0156501","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27248837?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0156501&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC4889062","pmid":"27248837","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0156501","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Tachykinin-Related Peptides Share a G Protein-Coupled Receptor with Ion Transport Peptide-Like in the Silkworm Bombyx mori","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tachykininrelated-peptides-share-g-proteincoupled-receptor-ion-transport-peptidelike-silkworm-bombyx"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":6258069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272924,"mean":12.062282592526,"rank":189582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":51506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272924,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114245,"mean":10.575903767375,"rank":83531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114245,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4330,"mean":11.461594363594,"rank":2979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4330,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
