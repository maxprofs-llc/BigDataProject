The clinical data included the Ig type, hemoglobin level, platelet count, creatinine, calciumion albumin, \u03b22-MG, LDH, plasmocytes in bone marrow, MPV, complications such as diabetes, a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial events such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, thrombosis and blood clotting. All patients were divided into low MPV group (\u22648.50 fl) and high MPV group (>8.50 fl). The biochemical parameters and prognosis of the 2 groups were compared.\nWhen MPV was 8.50 fl, the higest sensitivety and specificity were 55.56% and 80.00% respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.656 (95% CI: 0.515-0.797), the IgA type, creatinine level and IgH rearrangement in MM patients were related with MPV. The ratio of IgA and IgH rearrangements in patients with low MPV was higher than that in patients with high MPV, and the ratio of patients with creatinine >176.8 \u00b5mol\/L was lower than that of patients with high MPV (P<0.05). The age, sex, ECOG PS, complications, ISS stage, hemoglobin level, platelet count, calcium ion, albumin, \u03b22 microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase and bone marrow plasma cell ratio were not statistically significantly different between the 2 groups. Patients with low MPV had a shorter OS (P=0.039) than those with higher MPV. Univariate analysis showed that MPV, BM plasma cell ratio and age>60 years correleted with OS. Multivariate analysis showed that the low MPV and BM plasma cell ratio were correlated with shorter OS (P<0.05).\nThe low MPV is correlated with poor prognosis in patients with MM and may serve as an important indicator for disease progression and prognosis of patients with MM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfa","authors":["Gao, Peng","Xiao, Zhong-Ping","Fu, Kun","Han, Mei"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-24T12:37:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1009-2137"],"issue":"3","journal":"Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi","last_mentioned_on":1498307826,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28641644?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28641644","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"[Clinical Significance of Mean Platelet Volume Determination in Multiple Myeloma].","type":"article","volume":"25"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237823,"mean":12.894210695394,"rank":194728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237823,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":0.70314285714286,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.70454545454545,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ImmunePC_Papers\/statuses\/878592821208375296","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21322136],"posted_on":"2017-06-24T12:37:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunePCPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/686611418108407809\/IkK2E3oo_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot #PC papers #PubMed RSS | \u22652016 | #PlasmaCells are specialized #Bcells that secrete #antibody | Curated @mmw_lmw","id_on_source":"ImmunePC_Papers","tweeter_id":"4735354746","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":51},"tweet_id":"878592821208375296"}]}}
