Nowadays, minimally invasive approaches are spreading in every field of surgery and in liver surgery as well.\nWe retrospectively reviewed demographics, clinical, and pathologic characteristics and short-term outcomes of patients who had undergone minimally invasive resections for hepatocellular carcinoma at our institution between June 2012 and May\u00a02016.\nNo significant differences in demographics and comorbidities were found between patients in the laparoscopic (n\u00a0=\u00a024) and robotic (n\u00a0=\u00a022) groups, except for the rates of cirrhotic patients (91.7% and 68.2%, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.046). Perioperative data analysis showed that the operative time (mean, 211 and 318\u00a0min, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was the only parameter in favor of laparoscopy. Conversely, robotic-assisted resections were related to less Clavien I-II postoperative complications (22 cases versus 13 cases; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). As regards resection margins, the two groups were similar with no statistically significant differences in rates of disease-free resection margins.\nA modern hepatobiliary center should offer both open and minimally invasive approaches to liver disease to provide the best care for each patient, according to the individual comorbidities, risk factors, and personal quality of life expectations. Our results show that the robotic approach is a reliable tool for accurate oncologic surgery, comparable to the laparoscopic approach. Robotic surgery also allows the surgeon to safely approach liver segments that are difficult to resect in laparoscopy, namely segments I-VII-VIII.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f48","authors":["Paolo Magistri","Giuseppe Tarantino","Cristiano Guidetti","Giacomo Assirati","Tiziana Olivieri","Roberto Ballarin","Andrea Coratti","Fabrizio Di Benedetto"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jss.2017.05.005","first_seen_on":"2017-06-24T10:09:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00224804","1095-8673"],"journal":"Journal of Surgical Research","last_mentioned_on":1506692352,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28641762?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com\/article\/S0022-4804(17)30258-5\/fulltext?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=0022-4804_201709_217__&elsca4=General%20Surgery"],"pmid":"28641762","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Laparoscopic vs. Robotic Surgery for HCC: The First 46 Consecutive Cases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopic-versus-robotic-surgery-hepatocellular-carcinoma-first-46-consecutive-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3901475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4475874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240300,"mean":12.925241711368,"rank":107013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240300,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2111,"mean":2.6916236966825,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2111,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.4333333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/878555572273950721","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21320210],"posted_on":"2017-06-24T10:09:05+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":384},"tweet_id":"878555572273950721"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TuncaySARI\/statuses\/878697101739388928","license":"gnip","rt":["HPB_surgery"],"citation_ids":[21320210],"posted_on":"2017-06-24T19:31:29+00:00","author":{"name":"TuncaySARI","url":"http:\/\/www.tutkusaglik.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848870809099788290\/JVRz209P_normal.jpg","description":"Experienced Medical Device Marketing Professional and a Happy Father.","id_on_source":"TuncaySARI","tweeter_id":"29993773","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1180},"tweet_id":"878697101739388928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TuncaySARI\/statuses\/878697131846115328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21320210],"posted_on":"2017-06-24T19:31:36+00:00","author":{"name":"TuncaySARI","url":"http:\/\/www.tutkusaglik.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848870809099788290\/JVRz209P_normal.jpg","description":"Experienced Medical Device Marketing Professional and a Happy Father.","id_on_source":"TuncaySARI","tweeter_id":"29993773","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1180},"tweet_id":"878697131846115328"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UpperGIResearch\/statuses\/913760071540232193","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21320210],"posted_on":"2017-09-29T13:39:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Roux Library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/887770360858517510\/EZgWCK-P_normal.jpg","description":"Virtual Twitter library curating the latest upper gastrointestinal surgery research. #UpperGIResearch #HPB #Bariatrics #OG #FOAMed #EBM #SurgicalResearch","id_on_source":"UpperGIResearch","tweeter_id":"887766412558815233","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":536},"tweet_id":"913760071540232193"}]}}
