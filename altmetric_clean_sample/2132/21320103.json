An oral anticoagulant should be administrated to prevent stroke in patients with moderate stroke risk (ie, CHA2DS2-VASc score>2). If the stroke risk is low (i.e. the score=1), however, antiplatelet agent such as aspirin is widely used. Aspirin can cause peptic ulcer disease (PUD) while its alternative, clopidogrel, theoretically does not.\nTo elucidate the efficacy and safety between aspirin and clopidogrel, a multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed in AF patients with low stroke risk.\nAccording to sample size estimation based on previous literature, a total of 1560 AF patients with low stroke risk will be randomly assigned into 4 different groups dependent upon initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) results: two mono-antiplatelet treatment groups with either aspirin 100mg or clopidogrel 75mg for 1year; two antiplatelet agent and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) combination groups. Follow-up EGD will be performed at 1year.\nThe clinical follow-up will be performed for 1year after enrollment. The primary efficacy endpoint is to compare the annual stroke rate between aspirin and clopidogrel treatment groups. The primary safety endpoint is to compare the prevalence of drug-induced gastrointestinal (GI) and intracranial hemorrhage and upper-GI response including PUD based on EGD after 1year.\nThis trial will determine whether clopidogrel is noninferior in stroke prevention and superior in reduction of GI events including PUD to aspirin in AF patients with low stroke risk.
