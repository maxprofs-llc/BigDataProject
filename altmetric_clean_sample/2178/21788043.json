The self-assembly of BCPs is commonly accomplished by solvent vapor or thermal annealing, but generally these methods require long time (few hours) to obtain nanostructured thin films. In this contribution, a new and ultrafast method (using microwaves) is proposed-high temperature solvent vapor annealing (HTSVA), combining solvent vapor annealing with thermal annealing, to achieve fast and controllable self-assembly of amphiphilic BCP thin films. A promising carbohydrate-based BCP capable of forming cylindrical patterns with some of the smallest feature sizes is used for demonstrating how to obtain a highly ordered vertical cylindrical pattern with sub-10 nm feature sizes in few seconds by HTSVA. HTSVA provides not only a simple way to achieve BCP fast self-assembly in practical applications but also a tool to study the self-assembly behavior of BCPs under extreme conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Liao, Yingjie","Chen, Wen\u2010Chang","Borsali, Redouane"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201701645","first_seen_on":"2017-07-12T05:45:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0935-9648","1521-4095"],"journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1500106974,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201701645\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201701645\/pdf","pmid":"28681944","pubdate":"2017-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Carbohydrate-Based Block Copolymer Thin Films: Ultrafast Nano-Organization with 7 nm Resolution Using Microwave Energy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbohydratebased-block-copolymer-thin-films-ultrafast-nanoorganization-7-nm-resolution-using-microw-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.45,"6m":2.45,"3m":2.45,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213597,"mean":6.9554318223036,"rank":3400001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4805728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213597,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183136,"mean":11.449432724493,"rank":66554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":116215,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183136,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4358,"mean":10.910147808125,"rank":2045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4358,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":14.801288461538,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
