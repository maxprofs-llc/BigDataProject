We present a case of acute severe cholecystitis with massive gallbladder mucocele initially presenting with equivocal and inconclusive clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound findings. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allowed accurate evaluation of cholelithiasis and demonstrated a massive gallbladder mucocele.\nA 39-year-old Caucasian female presented with mild right upper quadrant pain coupled with intermittent epigastric discomfort after meals. Diagnostic abdominal ultrasound could not reliably detect cystic or common bile duct stones due to patient obesity and meteorism. Computed tomography was contraindicated due to severe contrast allergy. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography allowed timely, accurate evaluation of cholelithiasis. This subsequently demonstrated a massive gallbladder mucocele requiring urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be considered as a complementary imaging modality to assess patients presenting with atypical biliary symptoms, particularly when ultrasound is equivocal or inconclusive, clinical and laboratory findings are non-specific, and computer tomography is contraindicated. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can also be considered in patients with acute cholecystitis not adherent to a specific severity grade.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f2","authors":["Queennie Reyes","Ruth Louise McLeod","Katrina Fernandes","Vijayragavan Muralidharan","Laurence Weinberg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijscr.2017.04.031","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T11:29:19+00:00","issns":["22102612"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1495251543,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijscr.2017.04.031","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S2210261217302225&_version=1&md5=3b3e72a89fc2b18d556f7311d57a34b8"],"pmid":"28570881","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography uncovering massive gallbladder mucocele in a patient with ambiguous clinical and laboratory findings: A case report","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography-uncovering-massive-gallbladder-mucocele-patient-ambiguou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8242315,"mean":6.9690880509948,"rank":6255452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1112513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8242315,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122822,"mean":10.983715716368,"rank":85569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122822,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1134,"mean":1.6693662842012,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1134,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":0.655625,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSCaseReports\/statuses\/865773840655200260","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23670472],"posted_on":"2017-05-20T03:39:03+00:00","author":{"name":"IJS Case Reports","url":"http:\/\/www.casereports.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681556822805843970\/-0rB28HV_normal.png","description":"The Largest Journal for Surgical Case Reports in the World.
