Despite extensive research on PRV variant strains in the past two years, few studies have investigated PRV pathogenicity-related genes. To determine which gene(s) is\/are linked to PRV virulence, ten putative virulence genes were knocked out using clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\/Cas9 technology. The pathogenicity of these mutants was evaluated in a mouse model. Our results demonstrated that of the ten tested genes, the thymidine kinase (TK) and glycoprotein M (gM) knockout mutants displayed significantly reduced virulence. However, mutants of other putative virulence genes, such as glycoprotein E (gE), glycoprotein I (gI), Us2, Us9, Us3, glycoprotein G (gG), glycoprotein N (gN) and early protein 0 (EP0), did not exhibit significantly reduced virulence compared to that of the wild-type PRV. To our knowledge, this study is the first to compare virulence genes from the current pandemic PRV variant strain. This study will provide a valuable reference for scientists to design effective live attenuated vaccines in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Tang, Yan-Dong","Liu, Ji-Ting","Wang, Tong-Yun","Sun, Ming-Xia","Tian, Zhi-Jun","Cai, Xue-Hui"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-08269-3","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T11:22:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1502548628,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28798304?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28798304?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28798304","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["science"],"title":"Comparison of Pathogenicity-Related Genes in the Current Pseudorabies Virus Outbreak in China","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-pathogenicityrelated-genes-current-pseudorabies-virus-outbreak-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":4215272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3930133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179258,"mean":12.468587647902,"rank":89114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":82259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179258,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36870,"mean":14.721233448154,"rank":19520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":15651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36870,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3544,"mean":12.83105447361,"rank":1808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3544,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CrisprPhages\/statuses\/896330946869211136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23670088],"posted_on":"2017-08-12T11:22:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Phages & Crisprs","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"A twitterbot posting the latest pubmed publications on CRISPRs, phages, virusses and prophages.","id_on_source":"CrisprPhages","tweeter_id":"2787454512","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":41},"tweet_id":"896330946869211136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CRISPR_Articles\/statuses\/896380035224948737","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23670088],"posted_on":"2017-08-12T14:37:08+00:00","author":{"name":"CRISPRpapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/886767918465261569\/vd1fWbG2_normal.jpg","description":"Follow Me and Keep Up To Date with CRISPR Literature.","id_on_source":"CRISPR_Articles","tweeter_id":"886727933364240385","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":13},"tweet_id":"896380035224948737"}]}}
