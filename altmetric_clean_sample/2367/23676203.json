Acthar\u00ae Gel) treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\nPatients aged \u226518 years with \u22652 diagnoses for either RA or SLE between 07\/01\/2006 and 04\/30\/2015 were identified in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. Index RCI date was earliest date of a medical or pharmacy claim for RCI after diagnosis. Baseline characteristics, pre- and post-initiation HRU and costs were assessed using descriptive statistics.\nThis study identified 180 RA patients (mean age 60 years, 56% female) and 29 SLE patients (mean age 45 years, 90% female) who initiated RCI. First RCI use averaged 7.1 and 22.6 months after the initial RA and SLE diagnosis, respectively. After RCI initiation, RA patients incurred significantly lower per- patient-per-month (PPPM) all-cause medical costs ($1,881 vs. $682, P <0.01) versus the pre-initiation period, driven by lower PPPM hospitalizations costs ($1,579 vs. $503, P <0.01). Overall PPPM healthcare costs were higher ($2,751 vs. $5,487, P <0.01) due to higher PPPM prescription costs ($869 vs. $4,805, P <0.01). Similarly, SLE patients had decreased PPPM hospitalization costs ($3,192 vs. $799, P =0.04) and increased PPPM prescription costs ($905 vs. $7,443, P <0.01) after initiating RCI; the difference in overall PPPM healthcare costs was not statistically significant likely due to small sample size.\nThis study, across a heterogeneous population of variable disease duration, described clinical and healthcare utilization and costs of RA and SLE patients initiating RCI in a real-world setting. We observed that patients receiving RCI had lower utilization and costs for medical services in both disease populations, which partially offset the increased prescription costs by 30% and 37%. Future research is needed to explore factors associated with RCI initiation and its impact on long-term outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d4f","authors":["Bingcao Wu","Gaurav Deshpande","Tao Gu","Breanna Popelar","Michael Philbin","George J.
