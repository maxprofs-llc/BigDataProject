This research study examines the prevalence and the independent contribution of psychological IPV on mental health for both genders.\nThe initial sample comprises 661 college students from a Portuguese public university, who completed an e-survey. Statistical analysis focused on a subsample (n=364), 23% of which were men, after removing cases of physical and\/or sexual abuse.\nA total of 75% of men and 72% of women reported lifetime psychological victimization and no differences were found for sociodemographic factors, including gender. However, women reported significantly more instigations of psychological abusive acts (OR =5.41, 95% CI=1.88-15.55). Multivariate linear regression models revealed that post-traumatic stress symptoms-PTSS (\u03b2=.51; p<.001), depression (\u03b2=.34; p<.001) and anxiety (\u03b2=.22; p<.001)-were predicted by psychological IPV. The strongest relationship was established between psychological IPV and PTSS, and the final model accounts for 28.6% of the variance (F(6357)=23.86, p<.001).\nThis article provides an empirical basis to recognize the unique and serious impact of psychological IPV on mental health, and recommends screening psychological IPV as part of the clinical routine, developing a gender-inclusive approach, and implementing evidence-based protocols tailored to the needs of these victims.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Rita Come\u00e7anha","Miguel Basto-Pereira","\u00c2ngela Maia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2016.11.015","first_seen_on":"2016-12-02T09:17:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8384"],"journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1480670256,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comppsychjournal.com%2Farticle%2FS0010-440X%2816%2930504-1%2Ffulltext%3Frss%3Dyes&code=ycomp-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.comppsychjournal.com\/article\/S0010440X16305041\/pdf","pmid":"27939648","pubdate":"2016-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Clinically speaking, psychological abuse matters","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinically-speaking-psychological-abuse-matters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":6787551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250759,"mean":12.164136888952,"rank":203505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250759,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1203,"mean":3.034921797005,"rank":1079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1203,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.6166666666667,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
