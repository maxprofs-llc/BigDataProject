We consecutively diagnosed a total of 41 patients with RS3PE syndrome between October 2003 and September 2012 and evaluated their outcomes from medical records from the first year of follow-up.\nAlthough an excellent initial response to corticosteroids was noted in all 41 patients, 34 (82.9%) were still receiving corticosteroids and 13 (31.7%) showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at one year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that male gender and high CRP level at entry were independent variables associated with patients' one-year CRP level being \u22650.5\u2009mg\/dL. Odds ratios were 17.05 ([95% CI 2.41-370.12], p\u2009<\u20090.026) and 12.99 ([95% CI 1.78-269.62], p\u2009<\u20090.0096), respectively. Twenty-four patients (58.5%) were still receiving prednisolone (PSL)\u2009\u2265\u20095\u2009mg\/day at one year. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate were required in three patients (10.3%). Neoplasms were found in 14 patients (34.1%) and 1 of these had died due to lung cancer at one year.\nRS3PE syndrome initially responds well to corticosteroids with remission of symptoms. However, outcomes of RS3PE syndrome appear to be worse than expected, and may be influenced by gender and initial CRP level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310a","authors":["Origuchi, Tomoki","Arima, Kazuhiko","Umeda, Masataka","Kawashiri, Shin-Ya","Tamai, Mami","Nakamura, Hideki","Tsukada, Toshiaki","Miyashita, Taiichiro","Iwanaga, Nozomi","Izumi, Yasumori","Furuyama, Masako","Tanaka, Fumiko","Kawabe, Yojiro","Aramaki, Toshiyuki","Ueki, Yukitaka","Eguchi, Katsumi","Fukuda, Takaaki","Kawakami, Atsushi","Tomoki Origuchi","Kazuhiko Arima","Masataka Umeda","Shin-ya Kawashiri","Mami Tamai","Hideki Nakamura","Toshiaki Tsukada","Taiichiro Miyashita","Nozomi Iwanaga","Yasumori Izumi","Masako Furuyama","Fumiko Tanaka","Yojiro Kawabe","Toshiyuki Aramaki","Yukitaka Ueki","Katsumi Eguchi","Takaaki Fukuda","Atsushi Kawakami"],"doi":"10.1080\/14397595.2016.1192744","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2016-12-02T02:18:12+00:00","issns":["1439-7609","1439-7595"],"journal":"Modern Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1485100280,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27320419","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/14397595.2016.1192744"],"pmid":"27320419","pubdate":"2016-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Clinical outcomes in the first year of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) syndrome","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14397595.2016.1192744","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-outcomes-first-year-remitting-seronegative-symmetrical-synovitis-pitting-edema-rs3pe-syndro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":4043861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3838656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264512,"mean":12.130692939046,"rank":134810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":120306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264512,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":1.4078368794326,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.9111111111111,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ElWheet\/statuses\/804509894426562560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14230314],"posted_on":"2016-12-02T02:18:00+00:00","author":{"name":"whole wheet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2796277937\/2aa07da6988cea048c9afe1995f3f127_normal.jpeg","description":"Doctor, rheumatologist.
