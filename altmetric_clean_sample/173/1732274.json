Current practice differs considerably, from cessation of the medication at least 5 days before surgery to proceeding with surgery without delay. The purpose of this prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study was to determine the effect of preoperative exposure to clopidogrel and aspirin on perioperative bleeding complications in patients undergoing open arterial surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f17","authors":["Carlos Saadeh","Julien Sfeir"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvs.2013.05.092","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T17:12:14+00:00","issns":["0741-5214"],"journal":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1385584939,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jvs.2013.05.092","http:\/\/www.jvascsurg.org\/article\/S0741-5214(13)01124-5\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=0741-5214_201312_58_6&elsca4=cardiovascular_and_thoracic_surgery"],"pmid":"23891491","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Vascular Surgery","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Discontinuation of preoperative clopidogrel is unnecessary in peripheral arterial surgery","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discontinuation-preoperative-clopidogrel-unnecessary-peripheral-arterial-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059414,"mean":6.8395785174396,"rank":1707742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6341207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059414,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132820,"mean":7.1138402186435,"rank":28555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":104044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132820,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1911,"mean":4.6155015706806,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1911,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":3.4696097560976,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
