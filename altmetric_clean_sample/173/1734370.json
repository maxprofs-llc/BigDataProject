A set of transcription factors acts as a master regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. To our knowledge it is unknown whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition is important for clear cell renal cell carcinoma progression. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed mRNA levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated genes in renal cell carcinoma as well as their prognostic relevance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Chen, Dong","Gassenmaier, Maximilian","Maruschke, Matthias","Riesenberg, Rainer","Pohla, Heike","Stief, Christian G.","Zimmermann, Wolfgang","Buchner, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2013.08.052","first_seen_on":"2013-09-06T14:31:50+00:00","issns":["0022-5347"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1378477900,"links":["http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/PIIS0022534713052993\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(13)05299-3\/pdf","pmid":"24012533","pubdate":"2013-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Expression and prognostic significance of a comprehensive epithelial-mesenchymal transition gene set in renal cell carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-prognostic-significance-comprehensive-epithelialmesenchymal-transition-gene-set-renal-cel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2938496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94298,"mean":7.7409802644837,"rank":62412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":29462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94298,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5286,"mean":2.4104257332072,"rank":3516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5286,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":3.1659375,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
