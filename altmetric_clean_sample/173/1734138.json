Optical chemical sensors employ a transduction mechanism that converts a specific analyte recognition event into an optical signal. Here we report a novel concept for fluoride ion sensing where a porous crystalline framework serves as a host for a fluorescent reporter molecule. The detection is based on the decomposition of the host scaffold which induces the release of the fluorescent dye molecule. Specifically, the hybrid composite of the metal-organic framework NH2-MIL-101(Al) and fluorescein acting as reporter shows an exceptional turn-on fluorescence in aqueous fluoride-containing solutions. Using this novel strategy, the optical detection of fluoride is extremely sensitive and highly selective in the presence of many other anions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Florian M.
