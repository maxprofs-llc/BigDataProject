Taking advantage of 3D printing and surface-initiated ATRP, the feasible i3DP makes 3D printed complex architectures possible for nearly any desired surface modification for various applications, for example, even pouring water into a sieve was readily achieved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Xiaolong Wang","Xiaobing Cai","Qiuquan Guo","Tengyuan Zhang","Brad Kobe","Jun Yang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3cc45817b","first_seen_on":"2013-09-06T15:12:46+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1359-7345","1364-548X"],"issue":"86","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1387118700,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/c3cc45817b","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/CC\/c3cc45817b","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/CC\/c3cc45817b#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/cc\/c3cc45817b","pmid":"24002351","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10064","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"i3DP, a robust 3D printing approach enabling genetic post-printing surface modification","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/i3dp-robust-3d-printing-approach-enabling-genetic-postprinting-surface-modification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":139226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3490816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88899,"mean":7.6092450223854,"rank":6030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":82860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88899,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2933,"mean":2.7422237380628,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":2891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2933,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.48125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
