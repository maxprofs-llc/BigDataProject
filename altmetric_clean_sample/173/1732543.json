Infusible platelet membranes (IPM) prepared from new or outdated human platelets have been developed as an alternative to standard PCs, with the additional advantage of long shelf life and increased viral safety. Reduction of HLA antigens on the IPM has been assigned as one of the probable advantages of this product. In re-examining this issue, we studied the existence of HLA class I on the surface of IPM microparticles. In comparison we also surveyed HLA expression on the surface of the naturally occurred platelet-derived microparticles (nPMPs) during 7\u00a0days storage. Intended for producing IPM, PCs obtained from Iranian blood transfusion organization were lysed; virally inactivated with wet heat in the presence of a heat stabilizer and then sonicated. IPMs were separated using centrifugation and liquid-stored in 4\u00b0C. The expression of HLA class I antigens was surveyed using flow cytometry technique. HLA molecules were present on the microparticles. Shedding of HLA antigens was demonstrated from the surface of the both liquid-stored IPM and nPMPs during storage. Storage of IPM in 4\u00b0C was accompanied with significant reduction of HLA molecules. It seemed that achievement of HLA-free IPM could be impossible unless chloroquine treated platelets were used to prepare these microvesicles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007750","authors":["Yari F","Ahmadzadeh N","Azadpour S","Vaeli S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12288-011-0120-0","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T19:03:57+00:00","issns":["0971-4502"],"issue":"3","journal":"Indian Journal of Hematology & Blood Transfusion","last_mentioned_on":1378407557,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23997451\/?i=1&from=Platelet+Cell+surface+antigens"],"pmcid":"PMC3422389","pmid":"23997451","pubdate":"2013-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Blood Transfusion Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"HLA Antigens Shed from the Surface of Synthetic or Naturally Occurred Platelet-Derived Microparticles During Storage of Platelet Concentrate.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hla-antigens-shed-surface-synthetic-naturally-occurred-plateletderived-microparticles-during-storage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627879,"mean":4.9457436126612,"rank":2905326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627879,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88639,"mean":7.6186825740654,"rank":70597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88639,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":0.90377358490566,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
