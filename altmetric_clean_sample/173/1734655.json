The \"training hypothesis\" introduced here suggests that testicular descent is a mechanism for improving sperm quality. The hypothesis proposes that: (1) testicular descent decreases blood supply to maturing sperm cells, (2) sperm mitochondria respond to the resulting oxygen stress by enhancing their enzymatic machinery for oxidative metabolism, as do oxygen-stressed muscle cell mitochondria, and (3) the resulting increase in aerobic fitness of sperm cells is advantageous in inter-ejaculate competition. The hypothesis suggests that there is a quantity-quality trade-off in sperm production, where taxa with internal testes produce large volumes of low-quality sperm while taxa with scrotal testes produce smaller volumes of higher-quality sperm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["Freeman, S"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-06T16:54:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-5193"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1378486445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2246894"],"pmid":"2246894","pubdate":"1990-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"The evolution of the scrotum: a new hypothesis.","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-scrotum-new-hypothesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":2905755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88784,"mean":7.6482547559782,"rank":70727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88784,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1245,"mean":2.9452170418006,"rank":938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1245,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.5441111111111,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
