In dogs, it causes an infectious tracheobronchitis known as Kennel Cough. Human infections are unusual and almost exclusively described in immunocompromised patients who have had contact with a known animal reservoir. It is rarely reported in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), possibly hampered by low recovery from culture and organism misidentification. We describe the incidence and characteristics of B. bronchiseptica in our CF population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d49","authors":["Cynthia Brady","Patricia Ackerman","Mahrya Johnson","John McNamara"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcf.2013.08.002","first_seen_on":"2013-09-10T10:14:46+00:00","issns":["1873-5010"],"journal":"Journal of Cystic Fibrosis","last_mentioned_on":1378808059,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24011471?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24011471","pubdate":"2013-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Bordetella bronchiseptica in a pediatric Cystic Fibrosis center.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bordetella-bronchiseptica-pediatric-cystic-fibrosis-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3561729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94701,"mean":7.7657712988387,"rank":75848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94701,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":1.321489626556,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.7875,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":7,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACNPed\/status\/377374468181880832","license":"public","citation_ids":[1739383],"posted_on":"2013-09-10T10:14:19+00:00","author":{"name":"ACNP","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687251577\/logo_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Neumolog\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","id_on_source":"ACNPed","tweeter_id":"434250807","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":157},"tweet_id":"377374468181880832"}]}}
