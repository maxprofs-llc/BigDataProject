Acute schistosomiasis may be seen in returning travelers and migrants after primary infection. This form of schistosomiasis is frequently misdiagnosed due to its temporal delay and its nonspecific presentation and might occur even in countries where the disease is endemic, such as in Brazil. The patient developed the acute phase of schistosomiasis with severe clinical manifestations. The quantitative analysis revealed the presence of 240 eggs per gram of stool. The treatment was administered with oxamniquine, and the control of cure of the patient was monitored and was favorable. The present paper aims to emphasize the importance of a detailed clinical history including information regarding travel history.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef682a83ee09648b4fa2","authors":["Guiguet Leal, Diego Averaldo"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/650929","first_seen_on":"2013-09-07T17:31:22+00:00","issns":["2090-6625"],"journal":"Case Reports in Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1378574818,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/crim\/id\/2012\/650929\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/crim\/id\/2012\/650929.pdf","pmid":"22844623","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Acute Schistosomiasis in Brazilian Traveler: The Importance of Tourism in The Epidemiology of Neglected Parasitic Diseases","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-schistosomiasis-brazilian-traveler-importance-tourism-epidemiology-neglected-parasitic-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7598764,"mean":6.5466087659225,"rank":5750013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1019952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7598764,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130978,"mean":7.0042656191546,"rank":83316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":24603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130978,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.0982142857143,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
