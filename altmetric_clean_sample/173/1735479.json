In the CA test, the most active essential oil was from dill seeds, then followed essential oils from dill herb, peppermint herb and pine needles, respectively. In the SCE test, the most active essential oils were from dill herb and seeds followed by essential oils from pine needles and peppermint herb. Essential oils from dill herb and seeds and pine needles induced CA and SCE in a clear dose-dependent manner, while peppermint essential oil induced SCE in a dose-independent manner. All essential oils were cytotoxic for human lymphocytes. In the SMART test, a dose-dependent increase in mutation frequency was observed for essential oils from pine and dill herb. Peppermint essential oil induced mutations in a dose-independent manner. Essential oil from dill seeds was almost inactive in the SMART test.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Lazutka, J R","Mierauskiene, J","Slapsyte, G","Dedonyte, V"],"first_seen_on":"2013-09-07T03:45:19+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0278-6915"],"issue":"5","journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1378525509,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11313115"],"pmid":"11313115","pubdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Genotoxicity of dill (Anethum graveolens L.), peppermint (Menthaxpiperita L.) and pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) essential oils in human lymphocytes and Drosophila melanogaster.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genotoxicity-dill-anethum-graveolens-l-peppermint-menthapiperita-l-pine-pinus-sylvestris-l-essential"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2899054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89000,"mean":7.639074596344,"rank":70669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89000,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1114,"mean":6.7596010781671,"rank":830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1114,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":4.572380952381,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
