Zebrafish have also been used as a model system to identify factors influencing nicotine-associated reward by using an unbiased design. Here, we report that zebrafish exhibited putative nicotine biased CPP to an initially aversive compartment (nicotine-paired group). A counterbalanced nicotine-exposed control group did not show a significant preference shift, providing evidence that the preference shift in the nicotine-paired group was not due to a reduction of aversion for this compartment. Zebrafish preference was corroborated by behavioral analysis of several indicators of drug preference, such as time spent in the drug-paired side, number of entries to the drug-paired side, and distance traveled. These results provided strong evidence that zebrafish may actually develop a preference for nicotine, although the drug was administrated in an aversive place for the fish, which was further supported by molecular studies. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR analysis depicted a significant increase in the expression of \u03b17 and \u03b16 but not \u03b14 and \u03b22 subunits of the nicotinic receptor in nicotine-paired zebrafish brains. In contrast, zebrafish brains from the counterbalanced nicotine group showed no significant changes. Moreover, CREB phosphorylation, an indicator of neural activity, accompanied the acquisition of nicotine-CPP. Our studies offered an incremental value to the drug addiction field, because they further describe behavioral features of CPP to nicotine in zebrafish. The results suggested that zebrafish exposed to nicotine in an unfriendly environment can develop a preference for that initially aversive place, which is likely due to the rewarding effect of nicotine. Therefore, this model can be used to screen exogenous and endogenous molecules involved in nicotine-associated reward in vertebrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ximena Kedikian","Maria Paula Faillace","Ram\u00f3n Bernabeu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0069453","first_seen_on":"2013-09-07T22:22:41+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1378592295,"links":["http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0069453"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0069453.pdf","pmid":"23894483","pubdate":"2013-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e69453","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Behavioral and Molecular Analysis of Nicotine-Conditioned Place Preference in Zebrafish","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behavioral-molecular-analysis-nicotineconditioned-place-preference-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":2905573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88889,"mean":7.6661399738999,"rank":70779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88889,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64066,"mean":8.299947740576,"rank":50327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64066,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3805,"mean":10.822298107256,"rank":3160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3805,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
