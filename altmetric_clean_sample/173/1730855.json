Using a high-throughput screening method, we have identified several compounds that bind to different conformations of ClpB and analyzed their effect on the ATPase and chaperone activities of the protein. Two of them inhibit these functional properties as well as the growth of Gram negative bacteria (E. coli), displaying antimicrobial activity under thermal or oxidative stress conditions. This activity is abolished upon deletion of ClpB, indicating that the action of these compounds is related to the stress cellular response in which ClpB is involved. Moreover, their moderate toxicity in human cell lines suggests that they might provide promising leads against bacterial growth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Ianire Martin"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm400499k","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T03:31:45+00:00","issns":["0022-2623"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1378343643,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jm400499k"],"pmid":"23961953","pubdate":"2013-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Screening and Evaluation of Small Organic Molecules as ClpB Inhibitors and Potential Antimicrobials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-evaluation-small-organic-molecules-clpb-inhibitors-potential-antimicrobials-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":2549354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3542967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104439,"mean":7.917804707099,"rank":43228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":57943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104439,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3444,"mean":3.9001638106303,"rank":2067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3444,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":2.1769491525424,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
