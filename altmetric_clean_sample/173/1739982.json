Nanorods with aspect ratio of 8-12 can be aligned parallel to the surface in an end-to-end fashion by imposing geometric confinement via block copolymer-based supramolecular assemblies. Successful control over the orientation and location of nanorods requires a balance of particle-particle interactions and entropy associated with geometric confinement from the supramolecular framework, as well as consideration of the kinetics of assembly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003145","authors":["Kari Thorkelsson"],"doi":"10.1021\/nl402862b","first_seen_on":"2013-09-10T11:03:52+00:00","issns":["1530-6984"],"journal":"Nano Letters","last_mentioned_on":1378681912,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nl402862b"],"pmid":"24001327","pubdate":"2013-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"End-to-End Alignment of Nanorods in Thin Films","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endtoend-alignment-nanorods-thin-films"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":4606574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105161,"mean":7.9438152909852,"rank":70503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105161,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3658,"mean":11.256368608149,"rank":2901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3658,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":11.106583333333,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
