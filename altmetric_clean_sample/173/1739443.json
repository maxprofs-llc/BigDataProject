Currently, directly observed therapy (DOT) is the standard of care; however, high sustaining costs limit its availability, creating a need for more practical adherence confirmation methods. Techniques such as video monitoring and devices to time-register the opening of pill bottles are unable to confirm actual medication ingestions. A novel approach developed by Proteus Digital Health, Inc. consists of an ingestible sensor and an on-body wearable sensor; together, they electronically confirm unique ingestions and record the date\/time of the ingestion. A feasibility study using an early prototype was conducted in active TB patients to determine the system's accuracy and safety in confirming co-ingestion of TB medications with sensors. Thirty patients completed 10 DOT visits and 1,080 co-ingestion events; the system showed 95.0% (95% CI 93.5-96.2%) positive detection accuracy, defined as the number of detected sensors divided by the number of transmission capable sensors administered. The specificity was 99.7% [95% CI 99.2-99.9%] based on three false signals recorded by receivers. The system's identification accuracy, defined as the number of correctly identified ingestible sensors divided by the number of sensors detected, was 100%. Of 11 adverse events, four were deemed related or possibly related to the device; three mild skin rashes and one complaint of nausea. The system's positive detection accuracy was not affected by the subjects' Body Mass Index (p\u200a=\u200a0.7309). Study results suggest the system is capable of correctly identifying ingestible sensors with high accuracy, poses a low risk to users, and may have high patient acceptance. The system has the potential to confirm medication specific treatment compliance on a dose-by-dose basis. When coupled with mobile technology, the system could allow wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) for monitoring TB treatment as a replacement for DOT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Robert Belknap","Steve Weis","Andrew Brookens","Kit Yee Au-Yeung","Greg Moon","Lorenzo DiCarlo","Randall Reves"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0053373","first_seen_on":"2013-09-10T10:22:57+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1398777014,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053373","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0053373","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0053373","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3538759\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0053373.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3538759","pmid":"23308203","pubdate":"2013-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e53373","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Feasibility of an Ingestible Sensor-Based System for Monitoring Adherence to Tuberculosis Therapy","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-ingestible-sensorbased-system-monitoring-adherence-tuberculosis-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":28.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":28.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5481101,"mean":6.3653379577098,"rank":192343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5288538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5481101,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102881,"mean":7.955619362364,"rank":5310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":97568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102881,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95264,"mean":9.6347871471611,"rank":5593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":89667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95264,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3877,"mean":11.704189370485,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3877,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
