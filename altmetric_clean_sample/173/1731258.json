A recent genome-wide association study has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MICA, rs2596542 to be significantly associated with hepatitis C-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Japanese population. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether the SNP rs2596542 plays any role in hepatitis B virus (HBV) sero-clearance or in the development of complications associated with chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and\/or HCC. TaqMan genotyping assay was used to identify the association of the SNP among 584 normal healthy controls and 777 HBV-infected patients. The patient group was further categorized into inactive carriers (Group I), active carriers (Group II), cirrhosis (Group III) and cirrhosis-HCC (Group IV). Variation at this SNP was found to be significantly more frequent in control subjects than in patients (OR = 0.852; 95% C.I. = 0.730-0.994; p = 0.0415). Also, the SNP was found to have a highly significant association when the inactive carriers were compared to the rest of the patients (OR = 1.308; 95% C.I. = 1.058-1.617; p = 0.0130). The TT genotype was found to occur more frequently among active HBV carriers (groups II, III and IV) when compared to inactive HBV carriers, thus suggesting that the rs2596542-T may be recessively associated with an active HBV infection. However, no significant association was observed in the case of HBV-related cirrhosis or HCC. These findings indicate that the MICA rs2596542 has a significant role in HBV infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000288e","authors":["Al-Qahtani A","Al-Anazi M","Abdo AA","Sanai FM","Al-Hamoudi W","Alswat KA","Al-Ashgar HI","Khalaf N","Viswan N","Al-Ahdal MN"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexmp.2013.08.005","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T08:37:16+00:00","issns":["0014-4800"],"issue":"","journal":"Experimental & Molecular Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1378370231,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23994040?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23994040","pubdate":"2013-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology"],"title":"Genetic variation at -1878 (rs2596542) in MICA gene region is associated with chronic hepatitis B virus infection in Saudi Arabian patients.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-variation-1878-rs2596542-mica-gene-region-associated-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-sau-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3069363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":945846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94122,"mean":7.7389279119434,"rank":63915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":18601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94122,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":1.6628915662651,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
