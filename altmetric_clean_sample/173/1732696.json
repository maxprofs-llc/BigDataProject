My brother's second, first author paper is now online."],"citation":{"abstract":"To uncover the function of and interplay between the mammalian cytosine modifications 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), new techniques and advances in current technology are needed. To this end, we have developed oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq), which can quantitatively locate 5mC and 5hmC marks at single-base resolution in genomic DNA. In bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), both 5mC and 5hmC are read as cytosines and thus cannot be discriminated; however, in oxBS-seq, specific oxidation of 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and conversion of the newly formed 5fC to uracil (under bisulfite conditions) means that 5hmC can be discriminated from 5mC. A positive readout of actual 5mC is gained from a single oxBS-seq run, and 5hmC levels are inferred by comparison with a BS-seq run. Here we describe an optimized second-generation protocol that can be completed in 2 d.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000825c","authors":["Michael J Booth","Tobias W B Ost","Dario Beraldi","Neil M Bell","Miguel R Branco","Wolf Reik","Shankar Balasubramanian","Booth MJ","Ost TW","Beraldi D","Bell NM","Branco MR","Reik W","Balasubramanian S"],"doi":"10.1038\/nprot.2013.115","endpage":"1851","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T21:50:59+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc","bbsrc","cruk"],"issns":["1754-2189","1750-2799"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Protocols","last_mentioned_on":1396952189,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v8\/n10\/full\/nprot.2013.115.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24008380","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nprot\/journal\/v8\/n10\/abs\/nprot.2013.115.html"],"pmid":"24008380","pubdate":"2013-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epigenetics analysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"DNA methylation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"DNA sequencing","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1841","subjects":["science","clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Oxidative bisulfite sequencing of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nprot.2013.115","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxidative-bisulfite-sequencing-5methylcytosine-5hydroxymethylcytosine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5040723,"mean":5.9649658247412,"rank":975170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4060100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5040723,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98524,"mean":7.915012311846,"rank":21650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":76734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98524,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1001,"mean":6.870816,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1001,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":10.786303030303,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":68,"Student  > Ph.
