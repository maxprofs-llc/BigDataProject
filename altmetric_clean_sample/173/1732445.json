Histologic distinction between these different tumor types can be difficult in high-grade cases, in which significant interobserver diagnostic disagreement exists. Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas frequently harbor ARID1A and\/or PTEN mutations. Serous carcinoma acquires TP53 mutations\/inactivation at onset, with a significant subset harboring an additional mutation in PPP2R1A. This study examines the correlation between tumor histotype and genotype in 36 previously genotyped high-grade endometrial carcinomas. This included 23 endometrioid\/clear cell genotype and 13 serous genotype tumors. Eight subspecialty pathologists reviewed representative online slides and rendered diagnoses before and after receiving p53, p16, and estrogen receptor immunostaining results. \u03ba statistics for histotype-genotype concordance were calculated. The average \u03ba values for histotype-genotype concordance was 0.55 (range, 0.30 to 0.67) on the basis of morphologic evaluation alone and it improved to 0.68 (range, 0.54 to 0.81) after immunophenotype consideration (P<0.001). Genotype-incompatible diagnoses were rendered by at least 2 pathologists in 12 of 36 cases (33%) (3 cases by 2\/8 pathologists, 2 by 3\/8, 2 by 4\/8, 3 by 6\/8, 1 by 7\/8, and 1 case by 8\/8 pathologists). Six of the 12 were endometrioid\/clear cell genotype tumors, and the other 6 were serous genotype tumors. The histopathologic features associated with histotype-genotype-discordant cases were reviewed, and specific diagnostic recommendations were made to improve concordance. This study found that although the majority of morphologic diagnoses are genotype concordant, genotype-incompatible diagnoses are made in a significant subset of cases. Judicious use and interpretation of p53 immunohistochemistry in selected scenarios can improve histotype-genotype concordance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698e","authors":["Hoang LN","McConechy MK","K\u00f6bel M","Han G","Rouzbahman M","Davidson B","Irving J","Ali RH","Leung S","McAlpine JN","Oliva E","Nucci MR","Soslow RA","Huntsman DG","Gilks CB","Lee CH"],"doi":"10.1097\/pas.0b013e31828c63ed","first_seen_on":"2013-09-05T18:15:46+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0147-5185"],"issue":"9","journal":"The American Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1387209892,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/2013\/09000\/Histotype_Genotype_Correlation_in_36_High_grade.17.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24076778?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/2013\/09000\/Histotype_Genotype_Correlation_in_36_High_grade.17.pdf","pmid":"24076778","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1421","subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Histotype-Genotype Correlation in 36 High-grade Endometrial Carcinomas","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histotypegenotype-correlation-36-highgrade-endometrial-carcinomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5292730,"mean":6.2219196731992,"rank":2626004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2507709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5292730,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100878,"mean":7.9318990651982,"rank":46292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":51364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100878,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1325,"mean":3.5659229607251,"rank":980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1325,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":4.4079764705882,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
