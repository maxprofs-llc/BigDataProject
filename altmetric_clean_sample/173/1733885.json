The study investigated motor functions in boys diagnosed with Hyperkinetic Disorder (HKD, F.90.0). HKD corresponds to the ADHD-combined (ADHD-C) diagnosis in the DSM-IV. The paper addresses the ability of the instrument to discriminate between non-medicated boys with HKD and a control group consisting of normal non-referred boys without any clinical significant ADHD symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007de","doi":"10.1186\/1744-9081-5-22","first_seen_on":"2013-09-06T10:16:12+00:00","issns":["1744-9081"],"issue":"1","journal":"Behavioral and Brain Functions","last_mentioned_on":1378462303,"links":["http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/5\/1\/22"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-9081-5-22.pdf","pmid":"19450246","pubdate":"2009-05-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Behavioral Therapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"22","subjects":["brain","behavioralsciences"],"title":"The Motor Function Neurological Assessment (MFNU) as an indicator of motor function problems in boys with ADHD","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motor-function-neurological-assessment-mfnu-indicator-motor-function-problems-boys-adhd"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2905821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88783,"mean":7.648836633552,"rank":70730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88783,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":3.2106984126984,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.5142857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
