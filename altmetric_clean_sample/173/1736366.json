The ease with which audiologists can make a referral to a cochlear implant (CI) centre may affect the time it takes before a candidate can gain benefit from a CI. The current service evaluation explores audiologists' awareness of CIs, and whether this could influence referrals for cochlear implantation in the UK.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aac","doi":"10.1179\/1754762812y.0000000025","first_seen_on":"2013-09-07T20:33:56+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Cochlear Implants International: An Interdisciplinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1378586023,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/maney\/cii\/2013\/00000014\/00000004\/art00005"],"pmid":"23394596","pubdate":"2013-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Audiologists' knowledge of cochlear implants and their related referrals to the cochlear implant centre: Pilot study findings from UK.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/audiologists039-knowledge-cochlear-implants-related-referrals-cochlear-implant-centre-pilot-study-fi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2740725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":732635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89010,"mean":7.6323897583393,"rank":66623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89010,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.8347419354839,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.7,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Linguistics":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KidsAudiologist\/statuses\/376443183494103040","license":"public","citation_ids":[1736366],"posted_on":"2013-09-07T20:33:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Vicki Kirwin","url":"http:\/\/kidsaudiologist.info\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2221167954\/GPheadphones_normal.jpg","description":"Paediatric audiologist & advisor @NDCS_UK.
