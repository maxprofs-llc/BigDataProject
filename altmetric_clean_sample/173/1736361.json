Symptomatic relief was obtained in sixteen (80%) patients on mastic and in nine (50%) patients on placebo, while endoscopically proven healing occurred in fourteen (70%) patients on mastic and four (22%) patients on placebo. The differences between treatments were highly significant (P less than 0.01). Mastic was well tolerated and did not produce side effects. It is concluded that mastic has an ulcer healing effect, but further studies are needed to establish its role in treating peptic ulcer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000254c","first_seen_on":"2013-09-07T20:28:42+00:00","issns":["0305-1870"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Pharmacology & Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1378585709,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6395994"],"pmid":"6395994","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"A double-blind controlled clinical trial of mastic and placebo in the treatment of duodenal ulcer.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doubleblind-controlled-clinical-trial-mastic-placebo-treatment-duodenal-ulcer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88971,"mean":7.6461293020121,"rank":46289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88971,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":2.4085086206897,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EngAcrisoft\/statuses\/376441864989057024","license":"public","citation_ids":[1736361],"posted_on":"2013-09-07T20:28:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Eng.Acrisoft","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/MAqV8zsRjU","image":"http:\/\/si0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000357145487\/1f3f870118c64733940db754871bc67c_normal.jpeg","description":"Acrisoft worldwide courses","id_on_source":"EngAcrisoft","tweeter_id":"1699083086","followers":16},"tweet_id":"376441864989057024"}]}}
