Evidence has shown that trauma patients experience a hypercoagulable state postinjury, increasing the risk of thrombotic events. A case-controlled, retrospective analysis was performed on admitted trauma patients over a 2-year period. Results revealed that trauma patients are 1.6 times more likely to have a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) during their hospital admission, when compared with nontrauma patients with similar CVA risk factors. Several statistically significant differences between the groups were identified. On the basis of these results, trauma appears to be an independent, nonmodifiable risk factor for CVA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ad2","doi":"10.1097\/jtn.0b013e3182a171cf","first_seen_on":"2013-09-10T08:34:43+00:00","issns":["1078-7496"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Trauma Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1378835145,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/journaloftraumanursing\/Abstract\/2013\/07000\/Traumatic_Injury_May_Be_a_Predisposing_Factor_for.4.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/journaloftraumanursing\/2013\/07000\/Traumatic_Injury_May_Be_a_Predisposing_Factor_for.4.pdf","pmid":"24005115","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Traumatic Injury May Be a Predisposing Factor for Cerebrovascular Accident","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/traumatic-injury-predisposing-factor-cerebrovascular-accident-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":2533728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1587608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97192,"mean":7.9421864370159,"rank":48285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":35315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97192,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":1.2331860465116,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
