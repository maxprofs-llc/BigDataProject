H2L(R) reacts with Na[AuCl4]\u00b72H2O in MeOH in a 1:1\u00a0M ratio under formation of green gold(III) complexes of composition [AuCl(L(R))]. These compounds represent the first examples of gold(III) complexes with ONS chelate-bonded thiosemicarbazones. The in\u00a0vitro anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity against both trypomastigote and amastigote forms (IC50try\/ama) of CL Brener strains as well as the cytotoxicity against LLC-MK2 cells of the free ligands and complexes was evaluated. The complex [AuCl(L(Me))] was found to be more active and more selective than its precursor ligand and the standard drug benznidazole with a SItry\/ama value higher than 200, being considered as a lead candidate for Chagas disease treatment. Moreover the in\u00a0vitro activity against the replicative amastigote form (IC50ama) of T.\u00a0cruzi was additionally investigated revealing that [AuCl(L(Me))] was also more potent than benznidazole still with a similar selectivity index. Finally, docking studies showed that free ligands and complexes interact with the same residues of the parasite protease cruzain but with different intensities, suggesting that this protease could be a possible target for the trypanocidal action of the obtained compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Rettondin, Andressa R","Carneiro, Zumira A","Gon\u00e7alves, Ana C R","Ferreira, Vanessa F","Oliveira, Carolina G","Lima, Ang\u00e9lica N","Oliveira, Ronaldo J","de Albuquerque, S\u00e9rgio","Deflon, Victor M","Maia, Pedro I S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2016.05.003","endpage":"226","first_seen_on":"2016-05-19T15:53:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1768-3254","02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463673190,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27191616?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27191616","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"217","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Gold(III) complexes with ONS-Tridentate thiosemicarbazones: Toward selective trypanocidal drugs","type":"article","volume":"120","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/goldiii-complexes-ons-tridentate-thiosemicarbazones-toward-selective-trypanocidal-drugs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":6678291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269213,"mean":11.505471918042,"rank":224673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269213,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1058,"mean":1.7546679280984,"rank":695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1058,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.5557692307692,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
