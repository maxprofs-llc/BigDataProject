Recent study, here"],"citation":{"abstract":"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterized by long-lasting, disabling and unexplained fatigue that is often accompanied by unrefreshing sleep. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate sleep-wake rhythm and perceived sleep in adolescent CFS patients compared to healthy individuals. We analysed baseline data on 120 adolescent CFS patients and 39 healthy individuals included in the NorCAPITAL project. Activity measures from a uniaxial accelerometer (activPAL) were used to estimate mid-sleep time (mid-point of a period with sleep) and time in bed. Scores from the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ) were also assessed. The activity measures showed that the CFS patients stayed significantly longer in bed, had a significantly delayed mid-sleep time and a more varied sleep-wake rhythm during weekdays compared with healthy individuals. On the KSQ, the CFS patients reported significantly more insomnia symptoms, sleepiness, awakening problems and a longer sleep onset latency than healthy individuals. These results might indicate that disrupted sleep-wake phase could contribute to adolescent CFS; however, further investigations are warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f19","authors":["Pedersen, Maria","Ekstedt, Mirjam","Sm\u00e5stuen, Milada C.","Wyller, Vegard B.","Sulheim, Dag","Fagermoen, Even","Winger, Anette","Pedersen, Edvard","Hrubos\u2010Str\u00f8m, Harald","Hrubos-Str\u00f8m, Harald","Maria Pedersen","Mirjam Ekstedt","Milada C.
