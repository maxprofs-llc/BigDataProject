Fixed-end or isometric contractions stabilize joints and allow muscles to act as active struts during locomotion. Active muscles dissipate energy when they are lengthened by an external force that exceeds their current force producing capacity. These unaccustomed eccentric activities often lead to muscle weakness, soreness, and inflammation. During aging, the ability to produce force under these conditions is reduced and appears to be due to not only reductions in muscle mass but also to alterations in the basic mechanisms of contraction. These alterations include impairments in the excitation-contraction process, and the action of the cross-bridges. Also, it is well known that age-related skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by a preferential atrophy of fast fibers, and increased susceptibility to fast muscle fiber when aged muscles are exposed to eccentric contraction followed by the impaired recovery process has been reported. Taken together, the selective loss of fast muscle fiber in aged muscle could be affected by eccentric-induced muscle damage, which has significant implication to identify the etiology of the age-related functional changes. Therefore, in this review the alteration of age-related muscle function and its impact to\/of eccentric induced muscle damage and recovery will be addressed in detail.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b45e1","authors":["Choi, Seung-Jun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.imr.2016.05.004","first_seen_on":"2017-05-04T13:31:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2213-4220"],"issue":"3","journal":"Integrative Medicine Research","last_mentioned_on":1493916713,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28462114"],"pmcid":"PMC5390413","pmid":"28462114","pubdate":"2017-05-04T13:32:01+00:00","title":"Age-related functional changes and susceptibility to eccentric contraction-induced damage in skeletal muscle cell","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agerelated-functional-changes-susceptibility-eccentric-contractioninduced-damage-skeletal-muscle-cel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155745,"mean":6.9068271228166,"rank":5903748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1961811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155745,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236150,"mean":12.562606261301,"rank":153304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236150,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.2832558139535,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
