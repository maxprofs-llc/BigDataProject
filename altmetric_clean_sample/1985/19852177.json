The outstandingly high susceptibility to infections early in life is mainly attributable to the compromised state of the neonatal immune system. One important difference to the adult immune system is a bias towards T helper (Th) 2-responses in newborns. However, mechanisms regulating neonatal T-cell responses are yet incompletely understood. Granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (GR-MDSC) are myeloid cells with a granulocytic phenotype that suppress various functions of other immune cells and accumulate under physiological conditions during pregnancy in maternal and foetal blood. While it has been hypothesized that GR-MDSC-accumulation during foetal life could be important for the maintenance of maternal-foetal tolerance, the influence of GR-MDSC on the immunologic phenotype of neonates is still unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of GR-MDSC isolated from cord blood (CB-MDSC) on the polarisation of Th-cells. We demonstrate that CB-MDSC inhibit Th1-responses and induced Th2-responses and regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Th1-inhibition was cell-contact dependent and occurred independent of other cell types, while Th2-induction was mediated cell-contact independently through expression of ArgI and ROS by CB-MDSC and partially needed the presence of monocytes. Treg-induction by CB-MDSC also occurred cell-contact independently but was partially mediated through iNOS. These results point towards a role of MDSC in regulating neonatal immune responses. Targeting MDSC-function in neonates could be a therapeutic opportunity to improve neonatal host defence. This article is protected by copyright.
