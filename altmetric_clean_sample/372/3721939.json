We have shown that transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1, 6, 7, and 9 of PS1 form the \"catalytic pore\" structure within the membrane for intramembrane proteolysis. Here we report a novel monoclonal antibody 9D11, which directly recognizes the TMD1-proximal residues in the hydrophilic loop region. Intriguingly, 9D11 inhibited the \u03b3-secretase activity irrespective of the binding of known \u03b3-secretase inhibitors and abolished Notch signaling-dependent cancer cell viability. Our data suggest that the juxtamembrane region of TMD1 of PS1 is a novel molecular target for the mechanism-based inhibition of \u03b3-secretase and the development of the anticancer drug.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Shizuka Takagi-Niidome"],"doi":"10.1021\/bi301252r","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T01:39:08+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1424741940,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/bi301252r"],"pmid":"23210549","pubdate":"2012-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibition of \u03b3-secretase activity by a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular hydrophilic loop of presenilin 1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-%CE%B3secretase-activity-monoclonal-antibody-against-extracellular-hydrophilic-loop-presenilin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6425314,"mean":5.8861148152615,"rank":3030243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1925579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6425314,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164411,"mean":10.050848756158,"rank":91156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":55792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164411,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6108,"mean":2.5464571802849,"rank":4249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":1148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6108,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.9052989690722,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
