Previous NTB models usually assumed the same per capita rate of speciation across lineages. However, population dynamics may induce macroevolutionary feedbacks that can result in variable per capita speciation rates across lineages. In this paper, with analytical and simulation approaches, we explore how different scenarios of density-dependent speciation may impact the diversity and phylogenetic patterns of neutral communities, and compare the results to predictions of the original NTB model with an invariant speciation rate. Our results show that positive speciation rate-abundance relationships could result in higher species richness and evenness, enhanced stability (evidenced by higher post-disturbance recovery rates and lower temporal variability in species diversity), and higher imbalance in phylogenetic trees. The opposite patterns are predicted when per capita speciation rates decrease with abundance. Particularly, strong negative speciation rate-abundance relationships can generate a positive correlation between phylogenetic age and abundance, which has been observed in Panamanian tree species. Our findings demonstrate the importance of eco-evolutionary feedbacks for understanding long-term diversity and phylogenetic patterns in ecological communities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["Shaopeng Wang","Anping Chen","Stephen W Pacala","Jingyun Fang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2015.02.007","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:01:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8541"],"journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1451653442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25701450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25701450","pubdate":"2015-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Density-dependent speciation alters the structure and dynamics of neutral communities.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/densitydependent-speciation-alters-structure-dynamics-neutral-communities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6897266,"mean":6.1917907788066,"rank":2959638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3781735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6897266,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199937,"mean":8.8790447543215,"rank":85081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":108293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199937,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1852,"mean":3.3482333873582,"rank":906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1852,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":5.2175263157895,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
