A total of 369 NA-na\u00efve and 181 NA-experienced patients treated with entecavir monotherapy were analysed. Of the 369 NA-na\u00efve patients, 34 did not achieve VR at week 48. Of them, patients with HBV DNA \u2264 2000 copies\/mL at week 48 achieved a higher VR rate than those with HBV DNA >2000 copies\/mL (18\/23 vs 3\/11, P = 0.004). Two na\u00efve patients with HBV DNA >2000 copies\/mL developed entecavir- or lamivudine-resistant mutants. In 98 lamivudine-experienced patients without ever having lamivudine resistance, most patients with VR (72\/72) and partial VR (300-10(4) copies\/mL; 20\/23) at week 24 or VR at week 48 (89\/91) could maintain or achieve VR after prolonged therapy. In 75 patients with prior resistance to lamivudine, prolonged entecavir therapy led to low VR rate in those without VR at week 24 (13\/45) or 48 (4\/34) and high entecavir-resistance rate in those with or without VR at week 24 (6\/30 with and 23\/45 without) and 48 (8\/41 with and 21\/34 without). VR at week 48 was an independent predictor (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06-0.33) for entecavir-resistant mutant development among the 75 patients with prior lamivudine-resistant mutants. In conclusion, prolonged entecavir treatment resulted in a poor response in na\u00efve patients with HBV DNA >2000 copies\/mL at week 48 and patients with prior lamivudine-resistant mutants without VR at week 24 or 48.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f90","authors":["Chen CH","Hu TH","Hung CH","Wang JH","Lu SN","Lee CM"],"doi":"10.1111\/jvh.12239","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:26:33+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Viral Hepatitis","last_mentioned_on":1424777172,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24766327?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24766327","pubdate":"2014-04-29T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Antiviral effect of entecavir in nucleos(t)ide analogue-na\u00efve and nucleos(t)ide analogue-experienced chronic hepatitis B patients without virological response at week 24 or 48 of therapy.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiviral-effect-entecavir-nucleostide-analoguena%C3%AFve-nucleostide-analogueexperienced-chronic-hepatit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":4018767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146002,"mean":9.9892067862551,"rank":120502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146002,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":2.3319010416667,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.5025,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/status\/570182902375280641","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3724270],"posted_on":"2015-02-24T11:26:12+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
