In particular, the combination of optical and magnetic responses through a single particle system allows us to serve as novel multimodal molecular imaging contrast agents in clinical settings. Despite of essential medical imaging modalities and of significant clinical application, only few nanocomposites have been developed with dual imaging contrast. A new method for preparing quantum dots (QDs) incorporated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) based on layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly techniques have developed and used for cancer cells imaging.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f610000631","authors":["Ahmed SR","Dong J","Yui M","Kato T","Lee J","Park EY"],"doi":"10.1186\/1477-3155-11-28","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:17:50+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nanobiotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1424776630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23957878?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23957878","pubdate":"2013-08-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology","biotechnology"],"title":"Quantum dots incorporated magnetic nanoparticles for imaging colon carcinoma cells.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantum-dots-incorporated-magnetic-nanoparticles-imaging-colon-carcinoma-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":4018772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146001,"mean":9.9892676712331,"rank":120502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146001,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":3.5355,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
