The percentage of patients discharged was 67.4%. By multivariate logistic analysis, significant differences in home discharge destination were determined by six factors: the duration of hospitalization before discharge (odds ratio (OR) 0.993; 95% 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.988-0.999), the presence of excretion assistance (OR 0.115; 95% CI 0.043-0.308), individual payment of medical expense (OR 0.344; 95% CI 0.146-0.811), the degree of independent living for the demented elderly (OR4.570; 95% CI 1.969-10.604), presence of the primary caregiver (OR 8.638; 95% CI 3.121-23.906), and admission to a hospital from home (OR 5.483; 95% CI 2.589-11.613). This study suggests that necessity of excretion assistance, long duration of hospitalization, and high individual payment of medical expense were barriers to home discharge. In contrast, three factors i.e., admission to a hospital form home, low degree of independent living for the demented elderly, and presence of the primary caregiver, favored home discharge. The relation between a patient's status (cognitive status and incontinence) and a caregiver has an important effect on the home discharge. However, medication characteristics appeared to have little effect on recuperation destination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c62","authors":["Hashimoto M","Matsuzaki Y","Kawahara K","Matsuda H","Nishimura G","Hatae T","Kimura Y","Arai K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:28:45+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"7","journal":"Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1424777289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24989013?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24989013","pubdate":"2014-07-06T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Medication-related factors affecting discharge to home.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medicationrelated-factors-affecting-discharge-home"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":4018765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146002,"mean":9.989201649304,"rank":120501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146002,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":799,"mean":2.2531203007519,"rank":640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":799,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.1128571428571,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
