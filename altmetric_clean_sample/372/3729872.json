Apart from the F-FDG avid primary breast tumor, F-FDG avid thyroiditis, F-FDG avid right paratracheal tubercular lymphadenitis, and non-F-FDG avid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor were seen on PET\/CT. All the lesions were confirmed with fine-needle aspiration cytology. This interesting case demonstrates a spectrum of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative lesions on a single F-FDG PET\/CT examination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Punit Sharma","Chung Marangmei"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000000754","first_seen_on":"2015-02-25T07:12:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1424848326,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25706797?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25706797","pubdate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Multiple Pathologies Seen on a Single Contrast-Enhanced 18F-FDG PET\/CT: Reiteration of Lessons Previously Learned.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-pathologies-seen-single-contrastenhanced-18ffdg-petct-reiteration-lessons-previously-learne"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4804615,"mean":5.7481723709774,"rank":4022589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4804615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145266,"mean":10.023502743263,"rank":119983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145266,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1930,"mean":0.8689590461379,"rank":1353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1930,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":0.77067307692308,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/status\/570481347162206208","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3729872],"posted_on":"2015-02-25T07:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24805},"tweet_id":"570481347162206208"}]}}
