Here we show that in the absence of H3 lysine 56 acetylation replisome components become deleterious when replication forks collapse at natural replication block sites. This lethality is not a direct consequence of chromatin assembly defects during replication fork progression. Rather, our genetic analyses suggest that in the presence of replicative stress, H3 lysine 56 acetylation uncouples Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS DNA helicase complex and DNA polymerases through the replisome component Ctf4. In addition, we discovered that the N-terminal domain of Ctf4 necessary for the interaction of Ctf4 with Mms22, an adaptor protein of the Rtt101-Mms1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for the function of the H3 lysine 56 acetylation pathway suggesting that replicative stress promotes the interaction between Ctf4 and Mms22. Taken together, our results indicate that Ctf4 is an essential member of the H3 lysine 56 acetylation pathway and provide novel mechanistic insights into understanding the role of the H3 lysine 56 acetylation in maintaining genome stability upon replication stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002942","authors":["Pierre Luciano","Pierre-Marie Deh\u00e9","St\u00e9phane Audebert","Vincent G\u00e9li","Yves Corda"],"doi":"10.1534\/genetics.114.173856","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T17:20:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-2631"],"journal":"Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1424841935,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25697176?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25697176","pubdate":"2015-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Replisome Function During Replicative Stress Is Modulated by Histone H3 Lysine 56 Acetylation Through Ctf4.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/replisome-function-during-replicative-stress-modulated-histone-h3-lysine-56-acetylation-through-ctf4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4804615,"mean":5.7481723709774,"rank":3403182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":781971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4804615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146105,"mean":9.9782726003397,"rank":104964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":25511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146105,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2682,"mean":6.5015285341291,"rank":2344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2682,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":19.677466666667,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
