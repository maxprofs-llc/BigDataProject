The clinical manifestations associated with this highly conserved pathway are called RASopathies. Phenotypic features are diverse and overlapping, but cognitive impairment is a common symptom. Here, we propose an approach based on molecular networks that link learning, memory and forgetting to the RASopathies and various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism spectrum disorders. We demonstrate the cross-talks of the molecular pathways in RASopathies and memory and the role of compartmentalization in these processes. The approved drugs are also overviewed, and C. elegans is proposed as a viable model system for experimental exploration and compound target prediction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5063cf058f6100030ec","authors":["Gyurk\u00f3 MD","Stet\u00e1k A","S\u0151ti C","Csermely P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T14:33:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1424430375,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25694072?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25694072","pubdate":"2015-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Multitarget Network Strategies to Influence Memory and Forgetting: The Ras\/Mapk Pathway as a Novel Option.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multitarget-network-strategies-influence-memory-forgetting-rasmapk-pathway-novel-option"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785528,"mean":5.72647012043,"rank":4006251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785528,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145649,"mean":9.9888982478306,"rank":120149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145649,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":2.4299338235294,"rank":213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.83055555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
