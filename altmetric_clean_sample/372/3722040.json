Evidence-based considerations for when to test for APS are explored, along with the clinical significance of patients testing positive on multiple APS assays, so-called triple positivity. A detailed review of recently published laboratory guidelines for the detection of lupus anticoagulant and the solid-phase anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22GPI ELISAs is undertaken. Finally, a brief review of nonclassification criteria laboratory assays with potential future diagnostic utility is presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d6","authors":["Krilis SA","Giannakopoulos B","S.
