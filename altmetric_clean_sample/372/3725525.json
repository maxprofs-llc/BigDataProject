In turn, and in order to fine tune synaptic activity and neuronal communication, numerous neurotransmitters exert a potent negative autocrine and\/or paracrine control over the calcium signal provided by G-protein-coupled receptors. This regulation pathway of essential physiological importance is also extensively exploited for therapeutic purposes, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain by morphine and other mu-opioid receptor agonists. However, despite more than three decades of intensive research, important questions remain unsolved regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of direct G-protein inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. Here, we revisit this particular regulation and explore new considerations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Juliane Proft","Norbert Weiss"],"doi":"10.1124\/mol.114.096008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T12:41:02+00:00","issns":["1521-0111 (Online)"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1431437427,"links":["http:\/\/molpharm.aspetjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/12\/30\/mol.114.096008.long","http:\/\/molpharm.aspetjournals.org\/content\/87\/6\/890.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/molpharm.aspetjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/12\/30\/mol.114.096008.full.pdf","pmid":"25549669","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"G Protein Regulation of Neuronal Calcium Channels: Back to the Future","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/g-protein-regulation-neuronal-calcium-channels-back-future-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090406,"mean":6.0304841555845,"rank":2252218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2781927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090406,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153954,"mean":9.9920635128904,"rank":67215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":84124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153954,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1029,"mean":3.0801828793774,"rank":595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1029,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.7068181818182,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
