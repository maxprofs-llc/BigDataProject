Pregnant guinea pigs were injected with chlorpyrifos (20mg\/kg, s.c.) or vehicle (peanut oil) once per day for ten consecutive days, starting approximately on the 50(th) day of gestation. Cognitive behavior of female offspring was examined starting at 40-45 post-natal days (PND) using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), and brain structural integrity was analyzed at PND 70 using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, including T2-weighted anatomical scans and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI). The offspring of exposed mothers had significantly decreased body weight and brain volume, particularly in the frontal regions of the brain including the striatum. Furthermore, the offspring demonstrated significant spatial learning deficits in MWM recall compared to the vehicle group. Diffusion measures revealed reduced white matter integrity within the striatum and amygdala that correlated with spatial learning performance. These findings reveal the lasting effect of pre-natal exposure to CPF as well as the danger of mother to child transmission of CPF in the environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031b0","authors":["Roger J Mullins","Su Xu","Edna F R Pereira","Joseph D Pescrille","Spencer W Todd","Jacek Mamczarz","Edson X Albuquerque","Rao P Gullapalli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuro.2015.02.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:27:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-9711"],"journal":"NeuroToxicology","last_mentioned_on":1424777232,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25704171?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25704171","pubdate":"2015-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","neurology"],"title":"Prenatal Exposure of Guinea Pigs to the Organophosphorus Pesticide Chlorpyrifos Disrupts the Structural and Functional Integrity of the Brain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prenatal-exposure-guinea-pigs-organophosphorus-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-disrupts-structural-functional"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":2548577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1599310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146001,"mean":9.9892683561646,"rank":81111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146001,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":4.2285833333333,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.94166666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
