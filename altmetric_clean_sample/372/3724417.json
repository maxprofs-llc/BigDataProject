This lack of sustained benefits is thought to be partially the result of poor adherence to the prescribed home exercise program to be continued once therapy is completed. Most of what is known about older adults' adherence to physical therapy and home exercise comes from research seeking to identify and understand predictors of adherence, rather than trying to enhance adherence explicitly. The purpose of this study was to test a theoretically grounded approach to promoting adherence to home exercise programs in older adults.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a3e","authors":["Gallagher KM","Gallagher, Kristel M."],"doi":"10.1519\/jpt.0000000000000040","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:31:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-8412"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1502191840,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/9000\/00000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.99852.pdf?utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.99852.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx?utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx?cid=MR-eJP-Newsletter-PTRehab-PTRehab-JPT-NoPromo","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP&adbsc=social1660841","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/9000\/00000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.99852.pdf","pmid":"25695468","pubdate":"2015-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"20","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine","geriatrics"],"title":"Helping Older Adults Sustain Their Physical Therapy Gains: A Theory-Based Intervention to Promote Adherence to Home Exercise Following Rehabilitation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jgpt\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Helping_Older_Adults_Sustain_Their_Physical.4.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/helping-older-adults-sustain-physical-therapy-gains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":1836819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6445888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206976,"mean":9.274187703829,"rank":53973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":152197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206976,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251,"mean":3.9694,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.7885384615385,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
