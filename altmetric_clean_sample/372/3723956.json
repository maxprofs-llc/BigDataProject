Inflammation is a key pathological characteristic of dystrophic muscle lesion formation, but its role and regulation in the disease time course has not been sufficiently examined. In the present study, we used IL-10(-\/-)\/mdx mice lacking both dystrophin and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), to investigate whether a predisposition to inflammation affects the severity of DMD with advancing age. The IL-10 deficiency caused a profound DMD phenotype in the dystrophic heart such as muscle degeneration and extensive myofiber loss, but the limb muscle and diaphragm morphology of IL-10(-\/) (-)\/mdx mice was similar to that of mdx mice. Extensive infiltrates of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in regeneration of cardiotoxin-injured muscle, altered M1\/M2 macrophage phenotype and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines\/chemokines production were observed in the diaphragm and heart of IL-10(-\/-)\/mdx mice. We characterized the IL-10(-\/-)\/mdx mice as a dystrophic model with chronic inflammation and severe cardiorespiratory dysfunction, as evidenced by decreased percent fractional shortening (%FS) and ejection fraction percent (EF%) on echocardiography, reduced lower tidal volume on whole-body plethysmography. This study suggests that a predisposition to inflammation is an important indicator of DMD disease progression. Therefore, the development of anti-inflammatory strategies may help in slowing down the cardiorespiratory dysfunction on DMD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767c","authors":["Nitahara-Kasahara Y","Hayashita-Kinoh H","Chiyo T","Nishiyama A","Okada H","Takeda S","Okada T"],"doi":"10.1093\/hmg\/ddu113","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T11:15:05+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Human Molecular Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1424776479,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24659498?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24659498","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Dystrophic mdx mice develop severe cardiac and respiratory dysfunction following genetic ablation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dystrophic-mdx-mice-develop-severe-cardiac-respiratory-dysfunction-following-genetic-ablation-antiin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":2548575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1599308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146001,"mean":9.9892632191783,"rank":81111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146001,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3413,"mean":4.5484577960141,"rank":2516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3413,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":6.7353734939759,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
