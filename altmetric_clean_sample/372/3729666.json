However, efficacy and safety of liraglutide in adolescents has not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, possible pro-proliferative effects of GLP1R agonists on the endocrine and exocrine pancreas need to be further evaluated. We studied effects of liraglutide in adolescent pigs expressing a dominant-negative glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR(dn)) in the beta-cells, leading to a pre-diabetic condition including disturbed glucose tolerance, reduced insulin secretion and progressive reduction of functional beta-cell mass.\nTwo-month-old GIPR(dn) transgenic pigs were treated daily with liraglutide (0.6-1.2\u00a0mg per day) or placebo for 90\u00a0days. Glucose homeostasis was evaluated prior to and at the end of the treatment period by performing mixed meal and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (MMGTT and IVGTT). Finally animals were subjected to necropsy and quantitative-stereological analyses were performed for evaluation of alpha- and beta-cell mass, beta-cell proliferation as well as acinus-cell proliferation.\nMMGTT at the end of the study revealed 23% smaller area under the curve (AUC) for glucose, a 36% smaller AUC insulin, and improved insulin sensitivity, while IVGTT showed a 15% smaller AUC glucose but unchanged AUC insulin in liraglutide- vs. placebo-treated animals. Liraglutide led to marked reductions in body weight gain (-31%) and food intake (-30%) compared to placebo treatment, associated with reduced phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta (INSRB)\/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor beta (IGF1RB) and protein kinase B (AKT) in skeletal muscle. Absolute alpha- and beta-cell mass was reduced in liraglutide-treated animals, but alpha- and beta-cell mass-to-body weight ratios were unchanged. Liraglutide neither stimulated beta-cell proliferation in the endocrine pancreas nor acinus-cell proliferation in the exocrine pancreas, excluding both beneficial and detrimental effects on the pig pancreas.\nAlthough plasma liraglutide levels of adolescent transgenic pigs treated in our study were higher compared to human trials, pro-proliferative effects on the endocrine or exocrine pancreas or other liraglutide-related side-effects were not observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Streckel, Elisabeth","Braun-Reichhart, Christina","Herbach, Nadja","Dahlhoff, Maik","Kessler, Barbara","Blutke, Andreas","B\u00e4hr, Andrea","\u00dcbel, Nicole","Eddicks, Matthias","Ritzmann, Mathias","Krebs, Stefan","G\u00f6ke, Burkhard","Blum, Helmut","Wanke, R\u00fcdiger","Wolf, Eckhard","Renner, Simone"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-015-0431-2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-25T05:35:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1424842507,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/73\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s12967-015-0431-2.pdf","pmid":"25890210","pubdate":"2015-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"73","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist liraglutide in juvenile transgenic pigs modeling a pre-diabetic condition","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-glucagonlike-peptide1-receptor-agonist-liraglutide-juvenile-transgenic-pigs-modeling-prediab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4804531,"mean":5.7469224677581,"rank":2550912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1600995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4804531,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145273,"mean":10.022757255356,"rank":80804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145273,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1351,"mean":3.5405674074074,"rank":723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1351,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":4.6516822429907,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
