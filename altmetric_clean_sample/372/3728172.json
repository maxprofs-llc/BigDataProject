Often, these proteins do not contain any known signal sequence required for conventional protein secretion. In order to avoid misidentification of such \"leaked\" proteins as \"secreted\" proteins, reconstructing the process of protein secretion is essential. Here, we describe methods for the detection of reconstructed unconventional protein secretion and determination of regulatory proteins of secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that conjugating target proteins with a tag-sequence and utilizing various reagents and tools can facilitate quantitative detection of the secretion of target proteins. We expect that these methods will reveal novel unconventional secretion pathways of proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Natsuko Miura","Mitsuyoshi Ueda"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2309-0_4","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T19:34:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1456568474,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25702108?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25702108","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Membrane Biology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Evaluation of Unconventional Protein Secretion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","type":"article","volume":"1270","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-unconventional-protein-secretion-saccharomyces-cerevisiae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":3450540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3786225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201595,"mean":8.9562488665339,"rank":93438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":106134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201595,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4986,"mean":1.6973075225677,"rank":1314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":3611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4986,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.0118695652174,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
