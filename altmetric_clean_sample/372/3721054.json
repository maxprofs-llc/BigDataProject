The early success of the graduates of the program has been published; however, a more longitudinal assessment of the program was suggested and warranted. This study provides a 5-year follow-up of the 76 physicians that participated in the DSI from 2002 to 2009 to determine if the trend toward fellowship placement and academic appointments persisted. Additionally, this extended evaluation yields an opportunity to assess these young surgeons' professional progress and contributions to the field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f58","doi":"10.1016\/j.jamcollsurg.2014.12.006","first_seen_on":"2015-02-23T20:16:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1072-7515"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the American College of Surgeons","last_mentioned_on":1424727946,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalacs.org%2Farticle%2FS1072-7515%252814%252901860-2%2Fabstract&code=acs-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalacs.org\/article\/S1072751514018602\/pdf","pmid":"25700897","pubdate":"2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"362","subjects":["obstetrics","generalsurgery","gynecology"],"title":"The Diverse Surgeons' Initiative: Longitudinal Assessment of a Successful National Program","type":"article","volume":"220","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diverse-surgeons-initiative-longitudinal-assessment-successful-national-program"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5034930,"mean":5.9653228424835,"rank":3340964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1486379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5034930,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153753,"mean":9.9629882408034,"rank":102013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":44566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153753,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1417,"mean":5.8229802259887,"rank":939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1417,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":7.6132352941176,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
