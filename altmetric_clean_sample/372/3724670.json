Well-characterized cells at various passages were transplanted into nude mice with acute liver injury and tested for functional capacity. The SV40LT antigen-immortalized fetal liver cells showed a morphology similar to primary cells. Cultured cells demonstrated stable phenotypic expression in various passages, of hepatic markers such as albumin, CK 8, CK18, transcription factors HNF-4\u03b1 and HNF-1\u03b1 and CYP3A\/7. The cells did not stain for any of the tested cancer-associated markers. Albumin, HNF-4\u03b1 and CYP3A7 expression was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Flow cytometry showed expression of some progenitor cell markers. In vivo study showed that the cells expressed both fetal and differentiated hepatocytes markers. Our study suggests new approaches to expand hepatic progenitor cells, analyze their fate in animal models aiming at cell therapy of hepatic diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f610004589","authors":["Patil PB","Begum S","Joshi M","Kleman MI","Olausson M","Sumitran-Holgersson S","Pradeep B.
