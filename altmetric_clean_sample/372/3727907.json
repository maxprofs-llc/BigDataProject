We shall break down therapeutic approaches to hyperhidrosis into several steps: (a) determine the physiological causes of excess sweating; (b) establish the type of hyperhidrosis involved and screen for causes of secondary hyperhidrosis before diagnosing essential hyperhidrosis; (c) evaluate the severity of the hyperhidrosis by means of a validated scale (HDSS score), Minor's starch-iodine test or gravimetric analysis; (d) select one of the medical therapies currently available, i.e. topical therapy (antiperspirants, iontophoresis or botulinum toxin injection), systemic therapy (oxybutynin) or surgery (thoracic sympathectomy).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069ef","authors":["H Maillard","M Lecouflet"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annder.2014.11.005","first_seen_on":"2015-02-24T17:48:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0151-9638"],"journal":"Annales de Dermatologie et de V\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9ologie (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1424801437,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25697587?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25697587","pubdate":"2015-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"[Management of hyperhidrosis.]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prise-en-charge-dune-hyperhidrose"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":2548583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1599304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146001,"mean":9.9892913013701,"rank":81112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":47979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146001,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":1.3466576576577,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.93333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/status\/570278991648727040","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3727907],"posted_on":"2015-02-24T17:48:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!
