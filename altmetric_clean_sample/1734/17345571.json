We studied possible functional differences between these Tcf1 isoforms during early Xenopus development. After overexpression of single Tcf1 isoforms, two distinct phenotypes were observed. Overexpression of the B or D isoforms of Tcf1, which both lack a C-clamp, enhances early canonical Wnt signaling and induces ectopic dorsal mesoderm at the expense of ventrolateral mesoderm prior to gastrulation, causing severe antero-dorzalization of embryos. Overexpression of the E-isoform, which contains a complete C-clamp, does not induce ectopic dorsal mesoderm, but rather leads to severe caudal truncation. Overexpression of the C-isoform, which contains a partial C-clamp, induces a similar phenotype. Mutation of a single amino acid in the C-clamp, known to produce a hypomorphic mutant in D. melanogaster, led to a gain of function in inducing ectopic organizer tissue, as observed after overexpression of the B or D isoforms of Tcf1. Depletion of the C-clamp exon from the zygotic mRNA pool, by injection of a morpholino oligo that targets the splice acceptor site of the exon containing the C-clamp, caused a severe shortening of the AP-axis. Furthermore, embryos showed poor development of the CNS, paraxial mesoderm and primary blood vessels. In situ hybridization analysis showed that Lef1 expression was downregulated at the mid-hindbrain boundary, in the otic vesicles and the branchial arches. The results indicate that in post-gastrula stage Xenopus embryos, the E-tail of Tcf1 is required for expression of Lef1 and for blood vessel formation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e33","authors":["Giulietta Ro\u00ebl","Olaf Van Den Broek","Olivier Destr\u00e9e","Giulietta Ro\u00ebl","Olaf Van Den Broek","Olivier Destr\u00e9e"],"doi":"10.1387\/ijdb.160308od","first_seen_on":"2017-03-14T17:14:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0214-6282","1696-3547"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"International Journal of Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1489587725,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijdb.ehu.es\/web\/paper\/160308od\/functional-differences-between-tcf1-isoforms-in-early-xenopus-development"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijdb.ehu.es\/web\/descarga\/paper\/160308od","pmid":"28287244","pubdate":"2017-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"UPV\/EHU Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Functional differences between Tcf1 isoforms in early Xenopus development","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.intjdevbiol.com\/paper.php?doi=160308od","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functional-differences-between-tcf1-isoforms-early-xenopus-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":3965661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4209013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243053,"mean":13.635945361486,"rank":118154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":117744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243053,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":2.8377754385965,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
