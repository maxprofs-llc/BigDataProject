DFT calculations disclosed that the H-H \u03c3-bond cleavage by 1 occurs with nearly no barrier to afford the cis-dihydride species followed by cis-trans isomerization to form the trans-dihydride product, which is consistent with the experimental result. The O-H and C-H bond cleavages by 1 were computationally predicted to occur with moderate (\u0394G\u00b0(\u29e7) = 9.0 kcal\/mol) and acceptable activation energies (\u0394G\u00b0(\u29e7) = 22.5 kcal\/mol), respectively, suggesting that the Mo-Mo quintuple bond can be applied to various \u03c3-bond cleavages. In these \u03c3-bond cleavage reactions, the charge-transfer (CTMo\u2192XH) from the Mo-Mo quintuple bond to the X-H (X = H, C, or O) bond and that (CTXH\u2192Mo) from the X-H bond to the Mo-Mo bond play crucial roles. Though the HOMO (d\u03b4-MO) of 1 is at lower energy and the LUMO + 2 (d\u03b4*-MO) of 1 is at higher energy than those of RhCl(PMe3)2 (LUMO and LUMO + 1 of 1 are not frontier MO), the H-H \u03c3-bond cleavage by 1 more easily occurs than that by the Rh complex. Hence, the frontier MO energies are not the reason for the high reactivity of 1. The high reactivity of 1 arises from the polarization of d\u03b4-type MOs of the Mo-Mo quintuple bond in the transition state. Such a polarized electronic structure enhances the bonding overlap between the d\u03b4-MO of the Mo-Mo bond and the \u03c3*-antibonding MO of the X-H bond to facilitate the CTMo\u2192XH and reduce the exchange repulsion between the Mo-Mo bond and the X-H bond. This polarized electronic structure of the transition state is similar to that of a frustrated Lewis pair. The easy polarization of the d\u03b4-type MOs is one of the advantages of the metal-metal multiple bond, because such polarization is impossible in the mononuclear metal complex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Yue Chen","Shigeyoshi Sakaki"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b03103","first_seen_on":"2017-03-14T19:22:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1489527038,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b03103"],"pmid":"28290678","pubdate":"2017-03-16T22:19:13+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Mo\u2013Mo Quintuple Bond is Highly Reactive in H\u2013H, C\u2013H, and O\u2013H \u03c3-Bond Cleavages Because of the Polarized Electronic Structure in Transition State","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/momo-quintuple-bond-highly-reactive-hh-ch-oh-bond-cleavages-because-polarized-electronic-structure-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6041405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2015021,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242965,"mean":13.633166469106,"rank":161956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":66886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242965,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9247,"mean":1.1411970581873,"rank":3353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":5293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9247,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":1.4914600550964,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
