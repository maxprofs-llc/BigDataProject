Recent studies have established the LT as an important hip stabilizer in a squatting position, particularly in patients with osseous instability.\nThis review aims to concisely present the literature on LT tendinopathy and tears in order to guide health care professionals in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.\nWe reviewed the literature on the diagnosis and surgical management of ligamentum teres tendinopathy and tears.\nThe ligamentum teres is an important stabilizer to the hip joint, particularly with hip flexion and external rotation. Older age and acetabular bony pathomorphology are two of the known risk factors for LT tears. Symptoms of LT tendinopathy are largely non-specific, mimicking a wide range of other hip disorders including impingement and instability. Debridement of LT tears or reactive tissue has been reported with good outcomes, with more recent studies describing reconstruction of a completely torn, nonfunctional, or absent LT using various graft sources including synthetic grafts, autografts, and allografts.\nII.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef782a83ee09648b52d0","authors":["Matthew J.
