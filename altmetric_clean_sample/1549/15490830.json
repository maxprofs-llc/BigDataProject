Two common types of glycans, N-linked and O-linked, have been extensively analyzed in the last decades. N-glycans are typically released from glycoproteins by enzymes, while O-glycans are released from glycoproteins by chemical methods. It is important to identify and quantify both N- and O-linked glycans of glycoproteins to determine the changes of glycans.\nThe effort has been dedicated to study glycans from ovarian cancer cells treated with O-linked glycosylation inhibitor qualitatively and quantitatively. We used a solid-phase chemoenzymatic approach to systematically identify and quantify N-glycans and O-glycans in the ovarian cancer cells. It consists of three steps: (1) immobilization of proteins from cells and derivatization of glycans to protect sialic acids; (2) release of N-glycans by PNGase F and quantification of N-glycans by isobaric tags; (3) release and quantification of O-glycans by \u03b2-elimination in the presence of 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP).\nWe used ovarian cancer cell lines to study effect of O-linked glycosylation inhibitor on protein glycosylation. Results suggested that the inhibition of O-linked glycosylation reduced the levels of O-glycans. Interestingly, it appeared to increase N-glycan level in a lower dose of the O-linked glycosylation inhibitor. The sequential release and analyses of N-linked and O-linked glycans using chemoenzymatic approach are a platform for studying N-glycans and O-glycans in complex biological samples.\nThe solid-phase chemoenzymatic method was used to analyze both N-linked and O-linked glycans sequentially released from the ovarian cancer cells. The biological studies on O-linked glycosylation inhibition indicate the effects of O-glycosylation inhibition to glycan changes in both O-linked and N-linked glycan expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007fd","authors":["Shuang Yang","Naseruddin H\u00f6ti","Weiming Yang","Yang Liu","Lijun Chen","Shuwei Li","Hui Zhang","Shuang Yang","Naseruddin H\u00f6ti","Weiming Yang","Yang Liu","Lijun Chen","Shuwei Li","Hui Zhang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12014-017-9137-1","first_seen_on":"2017-01-14T14:53:34+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["1559-0275","1542-6416"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Proteomics","last_mentioned_on":1484405600,"links":["http:\/\/clinicalproteomicsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12014-017-9137-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clinicalproteomicsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12014-017-9137-1?site=clinicalproteomicsjournal.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28100988","pubdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","startpage":"3","title":"Simultaneous analyses of N-linked and O-linked glycans of ovarian cancer cells using solid-phase chemoenzymatic method","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-analyses-nlinked-olinked-glycans-ovarian-cancer-cells-using-solidphase-chemoenzymatic-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":6989786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255090,"mean":12.831508838091,"rank":210739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255090,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":4.3264,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.12,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
