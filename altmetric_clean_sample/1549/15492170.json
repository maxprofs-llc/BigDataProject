We previously isolated a novel single-chain variable fragment (scFv) 78 against TEM1 from a yeast display scFv library. Here, we evaluated the potential applications of scFv78 as a tool for tumor molecular imaging, immunotoxin-based therapy and nanotherapy. Epitope mapping, three-dimensional structure docking and affinity measurements indicated that scFv78 could bind to both human and murine TEM1, with equivalent affinity, at a well-conserved conformational epitope. The rapid internalization of scFv78 and scFv78-labeled nanoparticles was triggered after specific TEM1 binding. The scFv78-saporin immunoconjugate also exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity with high specificity to TEM1-positive cells in vitro. Finally, specific and sensitive tumor localization of scFv78 was confirmed with optical imaging in a tumor mouse model that has highly endogenous mTEM1 expression in the vasculature. Our data indicated that scFv78, the first fully human anti-TEM1 recombinant antibody, recognizes both human and mouse TEM1 and has unique and favorable features that are advantageous for the development of imaging probes or antibody-toxin conjugates for a large spectrum of human TEM1-positive solid tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249d","authors":["Xiaopeng Yuan","Mingjuan Yang","Xiang Chen","Xuhua Zhang","Shrey Sukhadia","Najia Musolino","Huijing Bao","Tingtao Chen","Chen Xu","Qirui Wang","Stephen Santoro","Daniel Ricklin","Jia Hu","Ruihe Lin","Wei Yang","Zhijun Li","Weijun Qin","Aizhi Zhao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00262-016-1937-z","first_seen_on":"2017-01-14T17:38:19+00:00","issns":["1432-0851"],"journal":"Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1487952190,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00262-016-1937-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00262-016-1937-z.pdf","pmid":"27933426","pubdate":"2016-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Characterization of the first fully human anti-TEM1 scFv in models of solid tumor imaging and immunotoxin-based therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-first-fully-human-antitem1-scfv-models-solid-tumor-imaging-immunotoxinbased-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":3908363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4174188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268728,"mean":12.574384256141,"rank":128921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":132309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268728,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":694,"mean":4.7253246753247,"rank":244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":694,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.2422,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
