Minimizing waste through clinical guidelines is a promising strategy to reduce spending without compromising patient care. In 2011, clinical guidelines recommended against the use of chest X-ray (CXR) for diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in pediatric ambulatory settings. However, use of CXR has not changed post-guideline. Thus, understanding the drivers of CXR utilization prior to guideline implementation could improve guideline adherence.\nRetrospective study using 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data set consisting of a representative sample of all emergency room admissions. Inclusion criteria consisted of: 18 years of age or younger and the diagnosis of outpatient CAP. Population was segmented by the presence of a CXR obtained during the visit. Socioeconomic status was determined by quartile classification of the estimated median household income based on patient ZIP code.\nIn 2009, children living in wealthier ZIP codes presenting to the emergency department (ED) who were diagnosed with CAP were more likely to receive diagnostic CXR. The use of chest radiograph was not statistically correlated to gender, weekday versus weekend admission, number of diagnoses at discharge, or total ED charges.\nThe research demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic status of the pediatric patient and use of chest radiograph for CAP in the ED setting prior to 2011 guideline publication. Further research to determine the reason for this correlation could give rise to focused efforts to successfully encourage adherence to clinical practice guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a17","authors":["Jones, Eric W","Meyer, Benjamin","Berg, Aaron M","Hsu, Benson S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T06:51:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0038-3317"],"issue":"5","journal":"South Dakota Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1503384635,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28813753?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28813753","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pre-Guideline Trends Associated with Chest Radiograph Usage for Pediatric Community-Acquired Pneumonia in Emergency Department Settings.","type":"article","volume":"70"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168167,"mean":12.704649691376,"rank":137820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168167,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":2.8608333333333,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PEMUpdates\/statuses\/899886500979941376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24166633],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T06:50:35+00:00","author":{"name":"PEM Updates","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3077019133\/002e2b27f97368b10a18a0e458ba4336_normal.jpeg","description":".","id_on_source":"PEMUpdates","tweeter_id":"903773208","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":436},"tweet_id":"899886500979941376"}]}}
