However, low stability and complex synthetic methods have substantially limited the application of tellurium nanorods for use as antioxidant and anticancer agents. Herein, a facile one-pot synthesis of functionalized tellurium nanorods (PTNRs) by using a hydrothermal synthetic system with a polysaccharide-protein complex (PTR), which was extracted from Pleurotus tuber-regium, as a capping agent is described. PTNRs remained stable in water and in phosphate-buffered saline and exhibited high hemocompatibility. Interestingly, these nanorods possessed strong antioxidant activity for scavenging 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS(.+) ) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazylhydrate (DPPH) free radicals and demonstrated novel anticancer activities. However, these nanorods exhibited low cytotoxicity toward normal human cells. In addition, the PTNRs effectively induced a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential in a dose-dependent manner, which indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction might play an important role in PTNR-induced apoptosis. Therefore, this study provides a one-pot strategy for the facile synthesis of tellurium nanorods with novel antioxidant and anticancer application potentials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Huang, Wei","Wu, Hualian","Li, Xiaoling","Chen, Tianfeng"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201600757","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T04:27:54+00:00","issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1466551640,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201600757?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201600757\/pdf","pmid":"27325381","pubdate":"2016-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Facile One-Pot Synthesis of Tellurium Nanorods as Antioxidant and Anticancer Agents","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-onepot-synthesis-tellurium-nanorods-antioxidant-anticancer-agents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":6861714,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230591,"mean":12.561320516935,"rank":187817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230591,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2417,"mean":1.3783551324503,"rank":2025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.486320754717,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Facile one-pot synthesis of tellurium nanorods as antioxidant and anticancer agents","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1311710848856983&id=714520748575999","license":"public","citation_ids":[18807886],"posted_on":"2016-06-21T23:27:20+00:00","summary":"Nanorods have been utilized in targeted therapy, controlled release, molecular diagnosis and molecule imaging due to their large surface area and their optical, magnetic, electronic and structural properties.
