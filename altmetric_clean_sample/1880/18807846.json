Previously, such observations had typically been performed by using a microscale disk-type ultramicroelectrode (UME). The use of a NW electrode decreased the background noise current and provided a shielding effect, owing to adsorption of the NPs onto the insulating sheath. Therefore, the transient current signal that was caused by the collision of single NPs could be more clearly distinguished from the background current by using a NW electrode instead of a UME. Furthermore, the use of a NW electrode increased the collisional frequency and the magnitude of the transient current signal. The experimental data were analyzed by using a theoretical model and a random walk simulation model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Shin, Changhwan","Bae, Hyeonhu","Kang, Mijeong","Kim, Bongsoo","Kwon, Seong Jung"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201600630","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T04:26:21+00:00","issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"issue":"15","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1466031820,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201600630?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201600630\/pdf","pmid":"27305586","pubdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Direct Observation of the Collision of Single Pt Nanoparticles onto Single-Crystalline Gold Nanowire Electrodes","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-observation-collision-single-pt-nanoparticles-onto-singlecrystalline-gold-nanowire-electrodes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7902020,"mean":6.6891515940364,"rank":6841941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7902020,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228731,"mean":12.505058426966,"rank":186173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228731,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2412,"mean":1.3785591041062,"rank":2022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2412,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.4759433962264,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Direct observation of single Pt nanoparticle collision onto single-crystalline gold nanowire electro","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1307343399293728&id=714520748575999","license":"public","citation_ids":[18807846],"posted_on":"2016-06-15T23:03:40+00:00","summary":"We observed Pt single nanoparticle (NP) collision onto a Au nanowire (NW) electrode via electrocatalytic amplification.
