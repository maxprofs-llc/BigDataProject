However, disease progression and changes in the gastrointestinal tract result in a declining window of treatment response in a majority of patients. Efforts have been made recently to improve levodopa bioavailability either by developing more effective oral formulations or by innovating routes of administration (intestinal infusion, transcutaneous or inhaled levodopa). IPX066 is a novel levodopa-carbidopa (LD\/CD) oral formulation combining immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) LD\/CD recently approved in the USA and the EU. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an approved therapy consisting of a suspension of levodopa and carbidopa infused directly into the proximal jejunum via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) tube through a portable infusion pump. Ongoing studies are evaluating the 'accordion pill' (AP09004), an ER LD\/CD formulation with gastroretentive properties. ND0612 is a proprietary liquid formulation of LD\/CD that enables subcutaneous administration via a small patch-pump device, and CVT-301 is a levodopa inhalation powder with rapid onset of action; both are currently in active studies. Other novel formulations have been discontinued, including DM-1992, which is a bilayer formulation containing an IR LD\/CD layer and an ER LD\/CD layer with gastroretentive properties, and XP21279, a novel oral levodopa prodrug that is absorbed from the small and large intestine by high-capacity nutrient transporters expressed throughout the gastrointestinal system. ODM-101 is a new oral formulation of levodopa\/carbidopa\/entacapone that contains a higher amount of carbidopa (65 or 105 mg), but no active studies are underway. The current review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic aspects, clinical efficacy, and potential adverse events of novel levodopa formulations currently available or under development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002585","authors":["Maria Eliza Freitas","Marta Ruiz-Lopez","Susan H.
