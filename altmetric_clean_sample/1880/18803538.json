The mol-ecule is nearly planar (r.m.s. deviation = 0.047\u2005\u00c5 for all non-H atoms), with a maximum deviation of 0.089\u2005(1)\u2005\u00c5 for the O atom. An S(6) ring motif formed by an intra-molecular N-H\u22efO hydrogen bond is observed. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by N-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, forming chains propagating along the a-axis direction. The chains are linked by N-H\u22efS hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional supra-molecular structure. The three-dimensional framework is reinforced by C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions. The absolute structure of the mol-ecule in the crystal was determined by resonant scattering [Flack parameter = 0.006\u2005(9)]. The crystal structure of the same compound, measured at 100\u2005K, has been reported on previously [Qasem Ali et al. (2012 \u25b8). Acta Cryst. E68, o964-o965]. The Hirshfeld surface analysis indicates that the most important contributions for the crystal packing are the H\u22efH (23.1%), H\u22efC (18.4%), H\u22efCl (13.7%), H\u22efS (12.0%) and H\u22efO (11.3%) inter-actions. A mol-ecular docking evaluation of the title compound with the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (RDR) enzyme was carried out. The title compound (I) and the active site of the selected enzyme show Cl\u22efH-C(LYS140), Cg(aromatic ring)\u22efH-C(SER71), H\u22efO-C(GLU200) and Fe(III)\u22efO\u22efFe(III) inter-molecular inter-actions, which suggests a solid theoretical structure-activity relationship.","authors":["Velasques, J.M.","Gervini, V.C.","Kickofel, L.","Farias, R.L. de","Oliveira, A.B. de","Velasques, J.M.","Gervini, V.C.","Kickofel, L.","Farias, R.L. de","Oliveira, A.B. de","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989017005461","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T00:00:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 5","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1492153961,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989017005461"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2017\/05\/00\/su5363\/su5363.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5418788","pmid":"28529780","pubdate":"2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Hirshfeld analysis and mol\u00adecular docking with the RDR enzyme of 2-(5-chloro-2-oxoindolin-3-yl\u00adidene)-N-methyl\u00adhydrazinecarbo\u00adthio\u00adamide","type":"article","volume":"73"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/852672779010932741","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18803538],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T00:00:07+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"852672779010932741"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HelliwellJohn\/statuses\/852781640505896960","license":"gnip","rt":["ActaCrystE"],"citation_ids":[18803538],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T07:12:41+00:00","author":{"name":"John R Helliwell","url":"http:\/\/www.manchester.ac.uk\/research\/John.helliwell\/personaldetails","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/620536343077240832\/tD_ZyvOa_normal.jpg","description":"Research Crystallographer based at Manchester University before at Daresbury Laboratory.
