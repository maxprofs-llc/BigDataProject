Previous back-to-back trials did not randomize for the examination order, creating a possible bias in favor of chromoendoscopy. We aimed to assess the difference in polyp detection between high definition white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) and virtual chromoendoscopy with I-SCAN in patients with Lynch syndrome. Patients and methods\u2003In this prospective, controlled trial, patients were randomized to either HD-WLE followed by I-SCAN (Group 1; n\u200a=\u200a31) or I-SCAN followed by HD-WLE (Group 2; n\u200a=\u200a30). Polyps found during the first pass were removed. The primary end point of the study was the difference in adenoma detection between HD-WLE and I-SCAN, expressed as the miss rate for adenomas for each technique. Results\u2003In Group 1, I-SCAN detected four additional patients with at least one adenoma, whereas HD-WLE did not increase the adenoma detection rate in Group 2 (relative risk [RR] 0.4; P\u200a=\u200a0.08). In Group 1, five adenomas were detected and removed with HD-WLE and a second pass with I-SCAN detected a further eight adenomas. In Group 2, I-SCAN detected 15 adenomas and subsequent HD-WLE detected 2 additional adenomas. The adenoma miss rate was significantly higher for HD-WLE (62\u200a%) compared with I-SCAN (12\u200a%; RR 0.44, 95\u200a% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 to 0.87; P\u200a=\u200a0.007). The miss rate for lesions was 57\u200a% and 24\u200a%, respectively, and was significantly different in favor of I-SCAN (RR 0.54, 95\u200a%CI 0.3 to 0.85; P\u200a=\u200a0.005). The mean inspection time in both groups was not significantly different during first (485 vs. 536 seconds; 95\u200a%CI\u200a-\u200a139.91 to 33.34) or second pass (421 vs. 387 seconds; 95\u200a%CI\u200a-\u200a32.24 to 104.89). Conclusion\u2003Our data suggest that virtual chromoendoscopy with I-SCAN reduces the adenoma and polyp miss rate in patients with Lynch syndrome, independently of inspection time.\nClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01823471).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027c5","authors":["Raf Bisschops","Sabine Tejpar","Hilde Willekens","Gert De Hertogh","Eric Van Cutsem","Raf Bisschops","Sabine Tejpar","Hilde Willekens","Gert De Hertogh","Eric Van Cutsem"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0042-121005","first_seen_on":"2017-04-13T22:17:48+00:00","issns":["0013-726X","1438-8812"],"journal":"Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1491485700,"links":["https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/abstract\/10.1055\/s-0042-121005"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/pdf\/10.1055\/s-0042-121005.pdf","pmid":"28107763","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Virtual chromoendoscopy (I-SCAN) detects more polyps in patients with Lynch syndrome: a randomized controlled crossover trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virtual-chromoendoscopy-iscan-detects-more-polyps-patients-lynch-syndrome-randomized-controlled-cros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235689,"mean":12.750339143274,"rank":192076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235689,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1266,"mean":1.9680600790514,"rank":769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1266,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.2366666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
