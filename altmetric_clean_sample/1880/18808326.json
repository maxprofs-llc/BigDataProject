To determine whether the immersive aspect of the 3D optics in RL contributes to improved performance, we compared the outcomes of laparoscopic skills by using just the 3D optics of the da Vinci versus the conventional 2D monitor with and without distraction.\nThirty-two participants without any laparoscopic experience were randomized evenly into four groups: RL, robotic-assisted laparoscopy with distraction (RL\u00a0+\u00a0D), CL, and conventional laparoscopy with distraction (CL\u00a0+\u00a0D). Each participant performed three Fundamentals of Laparoscopy Surgery tasks [peg transfer (Task 1), circle cutting (Task 2), and suturing with knot (Task 3)] for three repetitions. For each task, the mean time and errors were recorded and analyzed statistically for each group.\nCompared to other groups, CL\u00a0+\u00a0D took on average 1\u00a0min longer to complete Task 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), more than 1\u00a0min to complete Task 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and more than 2\u00a0min to complete the Task 3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). On Task 2, the deviations from the pattern were shorter for RL and RL\u00a0+\u00a0D compared to CL and CL\u00a0+\u00a0D (mean 0.33 and 0.37\u00a0cm vs. 0.55 and 0.58\u00a0cm, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). On Task 3, the deviations were also shorter for RL and RL\u00a0+\u00a0D compared to CL and CL\u00a0+\u00a0D (mean 0.23 and 0.24\u00a0mm vs. 0.61 and 0.63\u00a0mm, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWhen distraction was introduced, CL performed significantly worse. This suggests that using the conventional 2D monitor does not help with blocking out distraction. For Tasks 2 and 3, which require more precision and depth perception, the groups that used the 3D optics had shorter mean deviations than groups that used the conventional 2D monitor. This suggests that even when the robotic arms of the da Vinci are removed, there are still advantages to the immersive 3D optics, especially when distraction is present. The immersive aspect of the 3D optics may help improve performance in the OR, allowing surgeons to be more focused on the case and have greater depth acuity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Steven Kim","Audriene May","Heidi Ryan","Adnan Mohsin","Shawn Tsuda"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-017-5525-x","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T05:09:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1492673508,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00464-017-5525-x"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00464-017-5525-x.pdf","pmid":"28409364","pubdate":"2017-04-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Distraction and proficiency in laparoscopy: 2D versus robotic console 3D immersion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distraction-proficiency-laparoscopy-2d-versus-robotic-console-3d-immersion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4275471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2247001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238337,"mean":12.86313480968,"rank":133799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238337,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3220,"mean":2.635798695247,"rank":1577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3220,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":3.293661971831,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgEndosc\/statuses\/852750605898588160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18808326],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T05:09:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Endoscopy","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/medicine\/surgery\/journal\/464","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000013288750\/ca66ce36b5667e0eed3bf3c7d2ab6903_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of SAGES and EAES.
