In contrast, the relative motion of free graphene layers remains poorly understood. Here we report a study of the sliding behavior of graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) on a graphene surface. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we found that the GNFs show facile translational and rotational motions between commensurate initial and final states at temperatures as low as 5 K. The motion is initiated by a tip-induced transition of the flakes from a commensurate to an incommensurate registry with the underlying graphene layer (the superlubric state), followed by rapid sliding until another commensurate position is reached. Counterintuitively, the average sliding distance of the flakes is larger at 5 K than at 77 K, indicating that thermal fluctuations are likely to trigger their transitions from superlubric back to commensurate ground states.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Xiaofeng Feng"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn305722d","first_seen_on":"2013-01-24T22:10:31+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1359116588,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn305722d","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nn305722d"],"pmid":"23327483","pubdate":"2013-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Superlubric Sliding of Graphene Nanoflakes on Graphene","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superlubric-sliding-graphene-nanoflakes-graphene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.864,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.864},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":516678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6058274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293336,"mean":6.5012256362182,"rank":29392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":263929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293336,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4352,"mean":10.439153298092,"rank":719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4352,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":9.7119047619048,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
