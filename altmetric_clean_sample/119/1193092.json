The purpose of the current study was to explore the meaning in life among people with SMI and variables that may influence it such as internalized stigma and insight into the mental illness. We expected a significant negative correlation between internalized stigma and meaning in life, and that internalized stigma would moderate the relationship between insight and meaning in life. To explore these assumptions, 60 persons with SMI completed questionnaires that assessed their meaning in life, insight into their mental illness and internalized stigma, after which the data were analyzed using correlation and cluster analysis. Both hypotheses were confirmed. The mechanism behind the relationship between self-stigma and meaning in life and the theoretical and clinical implications of the moderation model are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Ehrlich-Ben Or S","Hasson-Ohayon I","Feingold D","Vahab K","Amiaz R","Weiser M","Lysaker PH"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.comppsych.2012.07.011","first_seen_on":"2013-01-23T15:50:41+00:00","issns":["0010-440X","0010440X"],"journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1358956065,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010440X1200140X"],"pmid":"22938821","pubdate":"2012-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Meaning in life, insight and self-stigma among people with severe mental illness ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/meaning-life-insight-selfstigma-among-people-severe-mental-illness-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6511445,"mean":6.031184709565,"rank":3084518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1946063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6511445,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292329,"mean":6.4955480419254,"rank":144380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":113381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292329,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":976,"mean":2.8214769230769,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":976,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":4.1210714285714,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
