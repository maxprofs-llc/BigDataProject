The method performs significantly better than previous prediction schemes and can easily be applied on genome-wide data sets. Discrimination between cleaved signal peptides and uncleaved N-terminal signal-anchor sequences is also possible, though with lower precision. Predictions can be made on a publicly available WWW server.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa82a3cf058f61000be2b","authors":["G von Heijne"],"doi":"10.1093\/protein\/10.1.1","first_seen_on":"2013-01-23T00:40:03+00:00","issns":["1741-0134","1741-0126","0269-2139"],"issue":"1","journal":"Protein Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1395394980,"links":["http:\/\/peds.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/10\/1\/1.short","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/protein\/10.1.1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9051728","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9051728&lt;\/ref&gt;","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9051728&lt;\/ref&gt; The protein structure contains a similar proportion of the secondary structures [[alpha-helices]] and [[Beta sheet|beta-strands]] (this does not include transmembrane structures). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garneier J, Osguthorpe D, Robson B| title = Analysis of the accuracy and implications of simple methods for predicting the secondary structure of proteins | journal = J.
