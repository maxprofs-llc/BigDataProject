It has been suggested that this population have high rates of mental disorders associated with tuberculosis. We assessed tuberculosis incidence, its transmission patterns and association with socio-demographic factors and mental disorders in Colombian homeless people. Prospective study which socio-demographic characteristics and mental disorders were assessed through interviews. Sputa from patients with respiratory symptoms were processed and clinical isolates analyzed by IS6110-RFLP. Multivariate analysis performed by logistic regression model. From 426 homeless studied, tuberculosis incidence found was 7.9\u00a0%. 44\u00a0% of isolates were clustering. It was found high risk of having tuberculosis associated with income from drugs trade (OR: 3.40 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.28-9.05]), dysthymia (OR: 2.54 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.10-5.86]) and receiving food from other homeless (OR: 2.47 [95\u00a0% CI: 1.16-5.25]). Tuberculosis incidence and degree of transmission are high in homeless studied. Implementing programs to better control tuberculosis among homeless population must consider socio-demographic factors and mental disorders associated with the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dee","doi":"10.1007\/s10903-013-9776-x","first_seen_on":"2013-01-25T18:40:36+00:00","issns":["1557-1920"],"journal":"Journal of Immigrant & Minority Health","last_mentioned_on":1381176706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23340806"],"pmid":"23340806","pubdate":"2013-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Private International Law, International & Foreign Law, Comparative Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","socialsciences"],"title":"Tuberculosis Among Homeless Population from Medell\u00edn, Colombia: Associated Mental Disorders and Socio-Demographic Characteristics.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tuberculosis-among-homeless-population-medelln-colombia-associated-mental-disorders-sociodemographic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":840303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3660922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286027,"mean":6.012308300644,"rank":62836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":222548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286027,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":2.0539315789474,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.5785714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
