Cisplatin and its derivatives are first-line chemotherapeutics, and their resistance is a major hurdle in successful ovarian cancer treatment. Understanding the molecular dysregulation underlying chemoresistance is important for enhancing therapeutic outcome. Here, we review two established pathways in cancer chemoresistance. p53 is a major tumor suppressor regulating proliferation and apoptosis, and its mutation is a frequent event in human malignancies. The PI3K\/Akt axis is a key oncogenic pathway regulating survival and tumorigenesis by controlling several tumor suppressors, including p53. The interplay between these pathways is well established, although the oncogenic phosphatase PPM1D adds a new layer to this intricate relationship and provides new insights into the processes determining cell fate. Inhibition of the PI3K\/Akt pathway by functional food compounds as an adjunct to chemotherapeutics may tip the balance in favor of apoptosis rather than survival, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, and reducing side effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51b3cf058f6100038d2","authors":["Ali AY","Farrand L","Kim JY","Byun S","Suh JY","Lee HJ","Tsang BK"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1749-6632.2012.06734.x","first_seen_on":"2013-01-24T14:21:26+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0077-8923"],"issue":"","journal":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1359037275,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23050965"],"pmid":"23050965","pubdate":"2012-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Molecular determinants of ovarian cancer chemoresistance: new insights into an old conundrum.","type":"article","volume":"1271","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-determinants-ovarian-cancer-chemoresistance-new-insights-old-conundrum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2899400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281407,"mean":5.7828125626319,"rank":224526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281407,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2806,"mean":3.5204128342246,"rank":2309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2806,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":4.4390933333333,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
