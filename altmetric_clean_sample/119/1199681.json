The UV-Vis spectral signature of a native Ru(III) neutral form computed at a TD-DFT level was compared to those of the oxidized Ru(IV) and reduced Ru(II) ones, allowing us to clearly identify the nature of all bands occurring in this spectral region and thus providing important photophysical insights for the use of this complex as a building block in polynuclear organometallic mixed valence molecular systems able to perform a swapping operation under light control.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Jacques Bonvoisin","Ilaria Ciofini"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3dt33043e","first_seen_on":"2013-01-26T18:02:26+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"22","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1368645603,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/C3DT33043E","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/DT\/c3dt33043e"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/dt\/c3dt33043e","pmid":"23407624","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"7943","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Spectral Signature of a Ru(II, III, IV) Complex: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spectral-signature-ruii-iii-iv-complex-combined-experimental-theoretical-investigation-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1971578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2516999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286561,"mean":6.0052028475712,"rank":115270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":169556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286561,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0186788577154,"rank":922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1610,"mean":1.1717526413922,"rank":233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1610,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/DaltonTrans\/status\/306018404672868352","citation_ids":[1199681],"posted_on":"2013-02-25T12:30:47+00:00","author":{"name":"DaltonTransactions","url":"http:\/\/www.rsc.org\/dalton","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/485011201395412994\/mKqHxFvX_normal.jpeg","description":"inorganic, organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry updates from Dalton Transactions","id_on_source":"DaltonTrans","tweeter_id":"20774885","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":5215},"tweet_id":"306018404672868352"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Esthress\/statuses\/306031738579210241","license":"public","rt":["DaltonTrans"],"citation_ids":[1199681],"posted_on":"2013-02-25T13:23:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Mar\u00eda Esther S.C.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788109712776531968\/Hd21Z1yX_normal.jpg","description":"Qu\u00edmica, con gusto por los metales.
