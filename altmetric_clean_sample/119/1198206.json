The objective of this study was to assess the seasonal pattern of moderate and severe exacerbations and analyze the influence of associated baseline factors. We also determined the timing of second exacerbations and the potential impact of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic on exacerbations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["Rabe KF","Fabbri LM","Vogelmeier C","K\u00f6gler H","Schmidt H","Beeh KM","Glaab T"],"doi":"10.1378\/chest.12-1277","first_seen_on":"2013-01-25T20:18:30+00:00","issns":["0012-3692"],"issue":"","journal":"CHEST","last_mentioned_on":1360713600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23188489","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1378\/chest.12-1277"],"pmid":"23188489","pubdate":"2012-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Seasonal distribution of COPD exacerbations in the POET-COPD trial.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seasonal-distribution-copd-exacerbations-prevention-exacerbations-tiotropium-copd-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":2017857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281453,"mean":5.8082125904239,"rank":151049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281453,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3222,"mean":3.7721074200559,"rank":1938,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3222,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":220,"mean":6.1182648401826,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":220,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
