Consequently, mPTPB represents an exciting new target to combat tuberculosis (TB) infection. We describe a medicinal chemistry oriented approach that transforms a benzofuran salicylic acid scaffold into a highly potent (IC(50) = 38 nM) and selective mPTPB inhibitor (>50 fold against a large panel of PTPs). Importantly, the inhibitor is capable of reversing the altered host immune responses induced by the bacterial phosphatase and restoring the macrophage's full capacity to secrete IL-6 and undergo apoptosis in response to interferon-\u03b3 stimulation, validating the concept that chemical inhibition of mPTPB may be therapeutically useful for novel TB treatment. The study further demonstrates that bicyclic salicylic acid pharmacophores can be used to deliver PTP inhibitors with high potency, selectivity, and cellular efficacy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Yantao He","He Y","Xu J","Yu ZH","Gunawan A","Wu LL","Wang L","Zhang ZY"],"doi":"10.1021\/jm301781p","endpage":"842","first_seen_on":"2013-01-25T21:55:46+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1359150941,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jm301781p"],"pmid":"23305444","pubdate":"2013-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"832","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Discovery and Evaluation of Novel Inhibitors of Mycobacterium Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase B from the 6-Hydroxy-benzofuran-5-carboxylic Acid Scaffold","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discovery-evaluation-novel-inhibitors-mycobacterium-protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-b-6hydroxybenzofura"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2306723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1589572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286028,"mean":6.0180386117393,"rank":143962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":105484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286028,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3227,"mean":3.2004302541847,"rank":1882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3227,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":4.10475,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
