This analysis examined whether changes in the speed of major cycling races reflect recent anti-doping efforts. Average speeds of 5 (th) place finishers of the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cycling races were obtained for the period 1990-2009. Between 1990 and 2004, the average speed had been increasing by 0.16 km\/h per year (p<0.001). In a downturn, since 2004, the average speed has decreased by 0.22 km\/h per year (p=0.031). The slowing down of professional cycling races is compatible with the hypothesis that recent anti-doping efforts in professional cycling have curbed the use of performance-enhancing substances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba9","authors":["Perneger TV"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0030-1247593","first_seen_on":"2013-01-22T22:13:30+00:00","issns":["0172-4622"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1359068889,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20148370"],"pmid":"20148370","pubdate":"2010-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Speed trends of major cycling races: does slower mean cleaner?","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/speed-trends-major-cycling-races-slower-mean-cleaner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6610944,"mean":6.1306422064143,"rank":883800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5725153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6610944,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292828,"mean":6.5190600388627,"rank":48034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":244672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292828,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1073,"mean":6.1008134328358,"rank":261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1073,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.6192903225806,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
