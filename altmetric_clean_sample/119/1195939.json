However, the potential for fatal outcome places a greater dependence on the pediatric oncology setting and delays this transition process, often beyond adolescence. Adverse long-term physical and psychological effects accompany survival for many of the cured children, and because these effects may not become manifest until adulthood, programs that support transition for childhood cancer survivors require the expertise of many subspecialists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b7","authors":["Anna T.
