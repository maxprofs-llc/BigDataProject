In deserts, retained seeds undergo hydration-dehydration cycles and thus may become primed. Priming enhances germination and seedling vigor. We test the hypothesis that serotiny evolves because it provides a site protected from predators in which seeds can become primed. Rainfall-cued dispersal of primed seeds may enhance this effect.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ee","authors":["Carlos Martorell"],"doi":"10.3732\/ajb.1200106","first_seen_on":"2013-01-25T20:58:20+00:00","issns":["1537-2197"],"journal":"American Journal of Botany","last_mentioned_on":1414339554,"links":["http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/21\/ajb.1200106.abstract","http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/100\/2\/365.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23345416"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amjbot.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/21\/ajb.1200106.full.pdf","pmid":"23345416","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Does retained-seed priming drive the evolution of serotiny in drylands?
