Decreased oral intake, malabsorption and increased intestinal losses are the major causes of Mg deficiency. The complications of Mg deficiency include: cramps, bone pain, delirium, acute crises of tetany, fatigue, depression, cardiac abnormalities, urolithiasis, impaired healing and colonic motility disorders. Serum Mg is an insensitive index of Mg status in IBD. Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of Mg is a sensitive index and should be monitored periodically. Parenteral Mg requirements in patients with IBD are at least 120 mg\/day or more depending upon fecal or stomal losses. Oral requirements may be as great as 700 mg\/day depending on the severity of malabsorption.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccd6","first_seen_on":"2013-01-23T06:28:46+00:00","issns":["0252-1156"],"issue":"2","journal":"Magnesium","last_mentioned_on":1358922685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/3294519\/"],"pmid":"3294519","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["metabolism","pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Magnesium and inflammatory bowel disease.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/magnesium-inflammatory-bowel-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2016694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281397,"mean":5.773797331874,"rank":150542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":80436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281397,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AT":1,"US":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tengocrohn\/statuses\/293968456808808448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1192082],"posted_on":"2013-01-23T06:28:36+00:00","author":{"name":"crohnie latingirl","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/467790413898588161\/kvQw-s72_normal.jpeg","description":"20 years living with Crohn's Disease.Six surgeries,J-Pouch,EC fistula,Endo.
