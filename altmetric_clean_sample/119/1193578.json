New work by Dulauroy et al has identified a myofibroblast progenitor with pericyte characteristics as an important mediator of scarring in skin and skeletal muscle after injury. The genetic ablation of this lineage, which was identifiable by the expression of ADAM12, led to a dramatic reduction in scarring and more complete regeneration. This work sharpens the conceptual rationale for therapeutic targeting of soluble or cellular mediators of scarring to promote tissue regeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ec9","authors":["Richard T.
