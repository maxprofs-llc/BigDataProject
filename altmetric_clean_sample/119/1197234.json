As reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are the main factors causing cellular damage, our objective was to study the scope of hypothermia in preventing hypoxia-induced oxidative damage. We analysed systemic and hepatic indicators of oxidative stress after an acute hypoxic insult (10% oxygen in breathing air) in normothermic (37\u00b0C body temperature) and hypothermic conditions (22\u00b0C) in rats. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in tissue damage (aspartate aminotransferase increased from 54.6 \u00b1 6.9 U l(-1) in control animals to 116 \u00b1 1.9 U l(-1) in hypoxia, and alanine aminotransferase increased from 19 \u00b1 0.8 to 34 \u00b1 2.9 U l(-1)), oxidative stress (nitric oxide metabolites increased from 10.8 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM in control rats to 23 \u00b1 2.7 \u03bcM in hypoxia, and thiobarbituric reactive substances increased from 3.3 \u00b1 0.2 to 5.9 \u00b1 0.4 nm) and antioxidant consumption (reduced\/oxidized glutathione ratio changed from 9.8 \u00b1 0.3 to 6.8 \u00b1 0.3). In contrast, when hypothermia was applied prior to hypoxia, the situation was reversed, with a reduction in aspartate aminotransferase (from 116 \u00b1 1.9 in hypoxic animals to 63 \u00b1 7.8 U l(-1) in animals exposed to hypothermia followed by hypoxia), alanine aminotransferase (from 34 \u00b1 2.9 to 19 \u00b1 0.9 U l(-1)), oxidative stress (nitric oxide metabolites decreased from 23 \u00b1 2.7 to 17.8 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcM and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances decreased from 5.9 \u00b1 0.4 to 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 nm) and antioxidant preservation (reduced\/oxidized glutathione ratio changed from 6.8 \u00b1 0.3 to 11.1 \u00b1 0.1). Hypoxia induced a decrease in liver enzymatic antioxidant activities even during hypothermia. Both treatments, hypoxia and hypothermia, produced a similar increase in hepatic caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, hypothermia prevented the tissue damage and oxidative stress elicited by hypoxia. Our results provide new evidence concerning the protective mechanism of hypothermia in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002899","authors":["Alva, Norma","Azuara, Daniel","Palomeque, Jes\u00fas","Carbonell, Teresa"],"doi":"10.1113\/expphysiol.2012.071365","endpage":"1124","first_seen_on":"2013-01-25T12:40:38+00:00","issns":["1469-445X","0958-0670"],"issue":"6","journal":"Experimental Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1359228858,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1113\/expphysiol.2012.071365\/abstract;jsessionid=5C748CAF08C6532EEE8C585388DA6671.d03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1113\/expphysiol.2012.071365\/abstract;jsessionid=CD457C9DCB5336AAB049318234C47715.d03t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1113\/expphysiol.2012.071365\/pdf","pmid":"23355193","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1115","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Deep hypothermia protects against acute hypoxia in vivo in rats: A mechanism related to the attenuation of oxidative stress","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deep-hypothermia-protects-against-acute-hypoxia-iin-vivoi-rats-mechanism-related-attenuation-oxidati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6327733,"mean":5.9772884897781,"rank":2976419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1892965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6327733,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283538,"mean":6.5377587404818,"rank":139424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":110360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283538,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":678,"mean":5.5062127031019,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":678,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.748,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
