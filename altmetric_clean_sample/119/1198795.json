Therefore, methods for quality control of honey and detection of its adulteration are very important. For this reason, the aim of this study is to develop and validate a new, simple and economical analytical method for detecting the adulteration of some Romanian honeys based on high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combined with image analysis. The proposed method involved the chromatographic separations of glucose, fructose and sucrose on silica gel HPTLC plates, developed twice with ethyl acetate-pyridine-water-acetic acid, 6:3:1:0.5 (v\/v\/v\/v), followed by dipping in an immersion solution. The documentation of plates was performed using TLC visualization device and the images of plates were processed using a digital processor. The developed HPTLC method was validated for selectivity, linearity and range, LOD and LOQ, precision, robustness and accuracy. The method was then applied for quantitative determination of glucose, fructose and sucrose from different types of Romanian honeys, commercially available.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Puscas A","Hosu A","Cimpoiu C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2012.11.064","first_seen_on":"2013-01-26T01:38:25+00:00","issns":["0021-9673","00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1359118936,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967312017979"],"pmid":"23245847","pubdate":"2012-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Application of a newly developed and validated high-performance thin-layer chromatographic method to control honey adulteration ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-newly-developed-validated-highperformance-thinlayer-chromatographic-method-control-honey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2905853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281981,"mean":5.806918873679,"rank":225591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281981,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1694,"mean":1.4992014176019,"rank":859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1694,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.0350515463918,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
