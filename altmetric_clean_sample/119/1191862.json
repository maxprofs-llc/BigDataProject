Sequential couplings of orthogonally protected precursors provide a simple and practical route toward a variety of tertiary phosphine derivatives having aryl substituents in any combination.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Minoru Hayashi","Takashi Matsuura","Ippei Tanaka","Hidetoshi Ohta","Yutaka Watanabe"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol303448j","first_seen_on":"2013-01-23T02:26:22+00:00","issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1360157657,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol303448j"],"pmid":"23330691","pubdate":"2013-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"130118133107003","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Pd-Catalyzed P\u2013C Cross-Coupling Reactions for Versatile Triarylphosphine Synthesis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pdcatalyzed-pc-crosscoupling-reactions-versatile-triarylphosphine-synthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5392736,"mean":6.2957306557804,"rank":2488510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2768977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5392736,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291231,"mean":6.3343257837449,"rank":118308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":163142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291231,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3341,"mean":3.368,"rank":1574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3341,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":3.8291847133758,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
