Sialendoscopy is also used for combined minimally invasive external and endoscopic approaches in patients with larger and proximal stones that would require excessively long laser procedures. The present paper reports on the technical experience from the Ear, Nose and Throat Unit of the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital of Bologna, and from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Hospital of Cagliari, Italy, including the retrospective analysis of the endoscopic and endoscopic assisted procedures performed on 48 patients (26 females and 22 males; median age 45.3; range 8-83 years) treated for chronic obstructive sialadenitis at the University Hospital of Cagliari from November 2010 to April 2016. The results from the Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital of Bologna have been previously published. The technical aspects of sialendoscopy are carefully described. The retrospective analysis of the University Hospital of Cagliari shows that the disease was unilateral in 40 patients and bilateral in 8; a total of 56 major salivary glands were treated (22 submandibular glands and 34 parotids). Five patients underwent bilateral sialendoscopy for juvenile recurrent parotitis. 10 patients were treated for non-lithiasic obstructive disease. In 33 patients (68.75%) the obstruction was caused by salivary stones (bilateral parotid lithiasis in 1 case). Only 8 patients needed a sialectomy (5 submandibular glands and 3 parotids). The conservative approach to obstructive sialadenitis is feasible and can be performed either purely endoscopically or in a combined modality, with a high percentage of success. The procedure must be performed with dedicated instrumentation by a skilled surgeon after proper training since minor to major complications can be encountered. Sialectomy should be the \"extrema ratio\" after failure of a conservative approach.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbbb","authors":["F. Carta","P. Farneti","S. Cantore","G. Macr\u00ec","N.
