The death of cholinergic neurons in AD is attributed to multiple factors, including: accumulation and fibrillation of amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b2) within the brain; metal ion toxicity; and oxidative stress. In this study, we used a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing full length A\u03b242 as a convenient in vivo system for examining the effect of honokiol against A\u03b2-induced toxicity. Furthermore, honokiol was evaluated for its ability to: inhibit A\u03b242 oligomerization and fibrillation; inhibit acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase; scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals; and chelate iron(II). Honokiol displayed similar activity to resveratrol and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in delaying A\u03b242-induced paralysis in C. elegans, and it exhibited moderate-to-weak ability to inhibit A\u03b242 on-pathway aggregation, inhibit cholinesterases, scavenge DPPH radicals, and chelate iron(II). Moreover, honokiol was found to be chemically stable relative to EGCG, which was highly unstable. Together with its good drug-likeness and brain availability, these results suggest that honokiol may be amenable to drug development, and the synthesis of honokiol analogues to optimize these properties should be considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Kantham, Srinivas","Chan, Stephen","McColl, Gawain","Miles, Jared","Veliyath, Suresh Kumar","Deora, Girdhar Singh","Dighe, Satish N","Khabbazi, Samira","Parat, Marie-Odile","Ross, Benjamin P.","Srinivas Kantham","Stephen Chan","Gawain McColl","Jared A.
