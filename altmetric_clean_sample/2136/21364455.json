The CS tract (CST) is also involved in a selective and complex modulation of sensory information in the dorsal horn. However, little is known about the spinal network engaged by the CST and the organization of CS projections that may encode different cortical outputs to the spinal cord. This study addresses the issue of whether the CS system exerts parallel control on different spinal networks, which together participate in sensorimotor integration. Here, we show that in the adult rat, two different and partially intermingled CS neurons in the sensorimotor cortex activate, with different time latencies, distinct spinal cord neurons located in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone of the same segment. The fact that different populations of CS neurons project in a segregated manner suggests that CST is composed of subsystems controlling different spinal cord circuits that modulate motor outputs and sensory inputs in a coordinated manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242b","authors":["Rafael Olivares-Moreno","Yunuen Moreno-Lopez","Luis Concha","Guadalupe Mart\u00ednez-Lorenzana","Miguel Cond\u00e9s-Lara","Matilde Cordero-Erausquin","Gerardo Rojas-Piloni"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00429-017-1447-6","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T07:51:41+00:00","issns":["1863-2653","1863-2661"],"journal":"Brain Structure & Function","last_mentioned_on":1498549890,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00429-017-1447-6"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00429-017-1447-6.pdf","pmid":"28528380","pubdate":"2017-05-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"The rat corticospinal system is functionally and anatomically segregated","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rat-corticospinal-system-functionally-anatomically-segregated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236553,"mean":12.965685633603,"rank":193983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236553,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":713,"mean":4.6944466292135,"rank":599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":713,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.8670731707317,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
