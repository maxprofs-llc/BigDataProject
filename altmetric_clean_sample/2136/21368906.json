One of the promising strategies is to deposit a pattern of electrocatalysts onto a semiconductor surface; leaving sufficient bare surface for light absorption, while minimizing concentration overpotential as well as resistive loss at the ultramicroelectrodes for faradaic reaction. This scheme can be successfully realized by \"maskless\" direct photoelectrochemical patterning of electrocatalyst onto an SiOx\/amorphous Si (a-Si) surface by light-guided electrodeposition technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at various pHs tells us much about how it works. The surface states at the SiOx\/a-Si interface can mediate the photogenerated electrons for hydrogen evolution, whereas electro-active species in the solution undergo outer-sphere electron transfer taking electrons tunneling across the SiOx layer from the conduction band. In addition to previously reported long-distance lateral electron transport behavior at a patterned catalyst\/SiOx\/a-Si interface, charging process of the surface states plays a crucial role in proton reduction, leading to deeper understanding of the operation mechanisms for photoelectrochemical water splitting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Lim, Sung Yul","Han, Donghyeop","Kim, Yang-Rae","Chung, Taek Dong"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.7b04961","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T11:36:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1944-8244","1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1498563403,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28650138?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28650138","pubdate":"2017-06-27T22:03:14+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
