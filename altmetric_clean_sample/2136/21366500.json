Median OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Subgroup analysis was conducted for patients with synchronous metastases (M1) and the elderly (aged\u226575y).\nA total of 4,217 patients with mRCC were identified, including 1,533 patients with M1 and 1,275 elderly patients. For patients with mRCC diagnosed in 2002 to 2005, 2006 to 2008, and 2009 to 2012, median OS was 10.0, 13.0, and 18.0 months. Similarly, median OS improved in the M1 and elderly populations. Elderly patients were less likely to be prescribed TT (\u226575 vs.<75y): 18.3 vs. 63.5% (in 2006-2008) and 28.6% vs. 55.9% (in 2009-2012). Diagnosis of mRCC in 2009 to 2012, nephrectomy and TT prescription were associated with improved OS in the total mRCC, M1, and elderly populations.\nThis real-world study showed continued significant improvement in mRCC OS during the late TT era, including in M1 and elderly populations. TT should be considered for all patients with mRCC based on tolerability, regardless of age.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e2","authors":["Magnus Lindskog","Thomas Wahlgren","Rickard Sandin","Jan Kowalski","Maria Jakobsson","Sven Lundstam","B\u00f6rje Ljungberg","Ulrika Harmenberg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urolonc.2017.05.013","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T09:50:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10781439"],"journal":"Urologic Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1498663092,"links":["http:\/\/www.urologiconcology.org\/article\/S1078-1439(17)30229-6\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"28623071","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Overall survival in Swedish patients with renal cell carcinoma treated in the period 2002 to 2012: Update of the RENCOMP study with subgroup analysis of the synchronous metastatic and elderly populations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overall-survival-swedish-patients-renal-cell-carcinoma-treated-period-2002-2012-update-rencomp-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":3.55,"6m":3.55,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":2002517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6423405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236861,"mean":12.973059908807,"rank":73495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":162875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236861,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":564,"mean":3.1598152753108,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":564,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.8635135135135,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"ES":1,"DE":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NatRevUrol\/statuses\/879637967190585344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21366500],"posted_on":"2017-06-27T09:50:08+00:00","author":{"name":"NatureReviewsUrology","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrurol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1630686023\/nrurol_Twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Urology news, conference tweets & editors' picks from Chief Ed Annette Fenner [AF] & Senior Eds Lou Stone [LS] and Clemens Thoma [CT]","id_on_source":"NatRevUrol","tweeter_id":"407730106","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":6812},"tweet_id":"879637967190585344"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MariaJRibal\/statuses\/879639950026735616","license":"gnip","rt":["NatRevUrol"],"citation_ids":[21366500],"posted_on":"2017-06-27T09:58:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Maria J.
