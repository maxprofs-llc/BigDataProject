The correct identification of the specific RGM infecting the skin will enhance therapeutic success.\nTo highlight the importance of rapid and precise identification of the Mycobacterium involved in skin infections in order to enhance therapeutic success.\nWe describe an RGM skin infection in an immunocompetent patient.\nClassic methods (biochemical tests and culture) of RGM identification are time-consuming, and the histopathological features are not specific. Some molecular methods are reliable but expensive. The PRAhsp-65 is a simple procedure that is helpful in identifying the specific agent of an RGM.\nAlthough skin infections caused by M peregrinum are rare, they represent a substantial clinical challenge. Specific and more effective treatment options depend on the development of precise and rapid methods for identifying mycobacterial species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000ca3","authors":["Patrick Alexander Wachholz","Christiane Salgado Sette","Dejair Caitano do Nascimento","Cleverson Teixeira Soares","Suzana Madeira Di\u00f3rio","Paula Yoshiko Masuda"],"doi":"10.1177\/1203475415616963","first_seen_on":"2017-06-27T10:11:57+00:00","issns":["1203-4754","1615-7109"],"journal":"Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1498557818,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26627593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26627593","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","dermatology"],"title":"Mycobacterium peregrinum Skin Infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imycobacterium-peregrinumi-skin-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236553,"mean":12.965665764821,"rank":193980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236553,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":2.5511295336788,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NTM_papers\/statuses\/879641361401602049","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21366823],"posted_on":"2017-06-27T10:03:38+00:00","author":{"name":"NTM-Papers","url":"http:\/\/www.ntm-net.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/556077140546834432\/IysSZZGo_normal.jpeg","description":"Publications related to Nontuberculous mycobacteria.","id_on_source":"NTM_papers","tweeter_id":"2981035635","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":76},"tweet_id":"879641361401602049"}]}}
