This is the ultimate goal of all the various processes and strategies created to meet the needs of people living together in communities. We propose a holistic integrated visualization, in the form of a community well-being assessment system, as a web-based advanced tool to be used by the executive and health officers of the sub-district administration organization (SAO) network to improve decision-making in order to strengthen their communities. Data were obtained from the Family and Community Assessment Program (FAP) and the SAO in nine sub-districts, covering all of the four regions of Thailand. The system incorporates dashboard architecture and assists the executive and health officers in the SAO to achieve better decision-making for the deployment of proper measures in communities. The model was developed for the Pakpoon SAO and was applied to the other eight SAOs. In order to evaluate the model, 243 users, covering all user groups from three sites, were asked to answer 18 questions during a meeting. The overall average score for user satisfaction was 4.12. The results indicate that this model can be used for community well-being assessment, in order to improve decision-making to strengthen communities in Thailand.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003da6","authors":["Puangrat Jinpon","Mullica Jaroensutasinee","Krisanadej Jaroensutasinee"],"doi":"10.1080\/17538157.2016.1255626","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2017-01-10T00:19:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1753-8165","1753-8157"],"journal":"Informatics for Health & Social Care","last_mentioned_on":1484007534,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17538157.2016.1255626"],"pmid":"28005441","pubdate":"2016-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Integrated information visualization to support decision-making in order to strengthen communities: Design and usability evaluation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrated-information-visualization-support-decisionmaking-order-strengthen-communities-design-usab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":6957711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254231,"mean":12.772524918381,"rank":209734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254231,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.9536764705882,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.2,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
