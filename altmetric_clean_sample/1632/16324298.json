A total of 100 patients with acquired PE and 100 control cases were enrolled in the study. After obtaining a detailed medical history, anthropometric (weight, height and waist circumference) and blood pressure measurements were performed. Ejaculation and erection functions were evaluated by Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), respectively. Self-estimated intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of the participants was recorded. Fasting blood samples were taken for biochemical and hormonal work-up. The median PEDT scores were 16 (9-22) and 4.5 (2-8) in acquired PE and control groups, respectively (P<0.001). The mean estimated IELT values in PE patients and controls were 36.1\u00b146.5\u2009 versus 488.2\u00b1313.8\u2009s (P<0.001). MetS was diagnosed in 51 patients (51%) in the PE group and 24 (24%) participants in the control group (P<0.001). A significant negative correlation was observed between the components of MetS and estimated IELT, except for diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the all components of MetS and total PEDT score, except for fasting blood glucose and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels. Logistic regression analysis revealed that, except blood pressure and HDL levels, MetS components were significant risk factors for PE after adjusting for age and total testosterone. In conclusion, MetS is associated with acquired PE.International Journal of Impotence Research advance online publication, 9 February 2017; doi:10.1038\/ijir.2017.3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b60","authors":["D Bolat","G U Kocabas","B Gunlusoy","O Aydogdu","M E Aydin"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijir.2017.3","endpage":"109","first_seen_on":"2017-02-11T08:00:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0955-9930","1476-5489"],"journal":"International Journal of Impotence Research","last_mentioned_on":1497874824,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijir\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ijir20173a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_neuroscience&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijir\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ijir20173a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_reproductive-biology","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijir\/journal\/v29\/n3\/abs\/ijir20173a.html"],"pmid":"28179637","pubdate":"2017-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sexual dysfunction","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Obesity","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"105","subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"The relationship between acquired premature ejaculation and metabolic syndrome: a prospective, comparative study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ijir.2017.3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-acquired-premature-ejaculation-metabolic-syndrome-prospective-comparative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":6068388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2023446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281107,"mean":12.648581759194,"rank":187209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":78822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281107,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":7.1262065217391,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThePostsynaptic\/statuses\/830325643271237632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16324298],"posted_on":"2017-02-11T08:00:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Paul McCullough","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785605387437404162\/5dKDZjwM_normal.jpg","description":"Hungrily eating #Psychology, #Neuropsychology, #Neuroscience, #Cognitive #Neuropsychology  http:\/\/facebook.com\/postsynaptic  (Join me)","id_on_source":"ThePostsynaptic","tweeter_id":"111995707","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2027},"tweet_id":"830325643271237632"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/felicidade52\/statuses\/876776679041097728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16324298],"posted_on":"2017-06-19T12:20:24+00:00","author":{"name":"M Louren\u00e7o, MD PhD","url":"http:\/\/about.me\/mariopsiquiatra","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/649269507450667009\/F4JY0TIi_normal.jpg","description":"Doctor and Couple Therapist. \nWords facilitate human relationships, if humans allow this to happen.\nTweets in English and Portuguese for a better world.","id_on_source":"felicidade52","tweeter_id":"308121056","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2361},"tweet_id":"876776679041097728"}]}}
