Using multicenter trial data, we related safety profiles, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), and intravenous iron dosing to achieved iron stores in 441 subjects randomized 2\u00a0:\u00a01 to ferric citrate or active control as their phosphate binder over 52\u00a0weeks. Intravenous iron was given at each site's discretion if ferritin \u2264\u00a01,000\u00a0ng\/mL and transferrin saturation \u2264\u00a030%. Multivariable time-dependent Cox regression jointly related the primary safety outcome (composite of cardiac, infection, gastrointestinal, and hepatobiliary serious adverse events) to moving averages of ferritin and transferrin saturation over the preceding 90\u00a0days with covariate adjustment. Multivariable generalized estimating equations related elevated ESA and intravenous iron doses to trailing 90-day averages of ferritin and transferrin saturation with covariate adjustment. The adjusted hazard ratio for the safety composite per 10% increase in transferrin saturation was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.68\u00a0-\u00a01.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and 1.09 (0.86\u00a0-\u00a01.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.48) per 400\u00a0ng\/mL increase in ferritin. The adjusted hazard ratio for the safety composite was 0.50 (0.29\u00a0-\u00a00.88, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) for the highest transferrin saturation tertile vs. the lowest. Adjusted odds ratios for higher intravenous iron dose were lower in the highest (0.23 [0.16\u00a0-\u00a00.35], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and middle transferrin saturation tertile (0.42 [0.31\u00a0-\u00a00.57], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) vs. lowest. Incidence of elevated ESA dose was lower in the highest transferrin saturation tertile (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Ferritin did not predict clinical events or ESA dose. Transferrin saturation may be a better marker than serum ferritin to judge optimal iron stores in dialysis patients. Transferrin saturations >\u00a034% are safe and provide maximal efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f0c","authors":["Kausik Umanath","Barbara Greco","Diana Jalal","Molly McFadden","Mohammed Sika","Mark Koury","Robert Niecestro","Lawrence Hunsicker","Tom Greene","Julia Lewis","Jamie Dwyer"],"doi":"10.5414\/cn108924","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T11:08:49+00:00","issns":["0301-0430"],"journal":"Clinical Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1493982516,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28128726?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28128726","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"The safety of achieved iron stores and their effect on IV iron and ESA use: post-hoc results from a randomized trial of ferric citrate as a phosphate binder in dialysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-achieved-iron-stores-effect-iv-iron-esa-posthoc-results-randomized-trial-ferric-citrate-phosp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236494,"mean":12.551143145886,"rank":192288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236494,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290,"mean":2.2803598615917,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSC_papers\/statuses\/860451154777432065","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19871797],"posted_on":"2017-05-05T11:08:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618441198634561537\/Y2u99HYj_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HSC_papers","tweeter_id":"3271095818","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":83},"tweet_id":"860451154777432065"}]}}
