Validation of these results in large animals is required before considering clinical applications. We evaluated the viability, immune tolerance and strain properties of such tracheal allografts heterotopically transplanted in a pig model.\nTen tracheal segments, 5 short (5 rings) and 5 long (10 rings), were obtained from male Landrace pigs. The tracheal segments were surgically denuded of their epithelium, then cryopreserved and stored in a tissue bank for 33 to 232 days. After thawing, tracheal segments stented with a silicone tube were wrapped in the omentum in 2 groups of 5 female recipients. The animals did not receive any immunosuppressive drugs. The animals were euthanized from Day 6 to Day 90 in both groups.\nAn effective revascularization of allografts regardless of length was observed. Lymphocyte infiltrate was shown in the early postoperative period and became non-significant after 30 days. Allografts displayed high levels of neoangiogenesis and viable cartilage rings with islets of calcification. Biomechanical measurements demonstrated strain properties similar to those of a fresh tracheal segment from Day 58.\nOur results demonstrate the acceptability and satisfactory stiffness of epithelium-denuded cryopreserved tracheal allografts implanted in the omentum, despite the absence of immunosuppressive drugs. Since the omentum has the capability to reach the tracheal region, this approach should be investigated in the setting of orthotopic transplants in a pig model before considering clinical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002823","authors":["Julien De Wolf","Mathias Brieu","Christophe Zawadzki","Alexandre Ung","Eric Kipnis","Ramadan Jashari","Thomas Hubert","Pierre Fayoux","Christophe Mariette","Marie-Christine Copin","Alain Wurtz"],"doi":"10.1093\/ejcts\/ezx116","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T10:21:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1010-7940","1873-734X"],"journal":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1493979664,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28472471?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28472471","pubdate":"2017-05-05T22:01:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Successful immunosuppressant-free heterotopic transplantation of tracheal allografts in the pig","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/successful-immunosuppressantfree-heterotopic-transplantation-tracheal-allografts-pig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":12.551201715068,"rank":192288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":3.4594110091743,"rank":784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":24.2675,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
