This transformation provides a simple access to 4-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methyl-5-arylthiazoles, which could be further converted into phenanthrothiazoles via palladium-catalyzed intramolecular direct arylation. When the direct arylation of 4-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methyl-5-arylthiazoles is conducted in the presence of an external heteroarene such as thiazoles, thiophenes, or imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, the intermolecular arylation of such external heteroarenes proceeds faster than the intramolecular reaction, allowing the formation of 1,2-di(heteroaryl)benzene derivatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Xinzhe Shi","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Soul\u00e9","Henri Doucet"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.joc.6b03023","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T17:37:05+00:00","issns":["0022-3263","1520-6904"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1494005804,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.joc.6b03023"],"pmid":"28271711","pubdate":"2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Phenanthrothiazoles and 1,2-Di(heteroaryl)benzenes through Successive Pd-Catalyzed Direct Arylations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-phenanthrothiazoles-12diheteroarylbenzenes-through-successive-pdcatalyzed-direct-arylation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161014,"mean":6.911576885363,"rank":1171260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6915481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161014,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":12.551127716794,"rank":49157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":185098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3797,"mean":3.4611938883035,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3797,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.8753333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
