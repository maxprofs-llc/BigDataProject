Leave-one-out cross validation can be used to quantify the predictive ability of a statistical model.\nNaive application of Leave-one-out cross validation is computationally intensive because the training and validation analyses need to be repeated n times, once for each observation. Efficient Leave-one-out cross validation strategies are presented here, requiring little more effort than a single analysis.\nEfficient Leave-one-out cross validation strategies is 786 times faster than the naive application for a simulated dataset with 1,000 observations and 10,000 markers and 99 times faster with 1,000 observations and 100 markers. These efficiencies relative to the naive approach using the same model will increase with increases in the number of observations.\nEfficient Leave-one-out cross validation strategies are presented here, requiring little more effort than a single analysis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa80e3cf058f61000bb14","authors":["Hao Cheng","Dorian J.
