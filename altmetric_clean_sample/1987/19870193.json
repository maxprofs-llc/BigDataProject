If Hem-o-lok clips tied with threads were applied to improve surgical view, the patient was recruited to the Hem-o-lok group. The other patients were recruited to the control group. Patient information, time of exposure procedure, number of clips used, number of trocars, exposure satisfaction, operation time, estimated blood loss, and perioperative complications were recorded.\nSixty-eight laparoscopic radical\/partial nephrectomies were performed by a single surgeon. For 31 cases, Hem-o-lok clips were tied with threads to improve surgical view. For the other 37 cases, no Hem-o-lok clips were used. All cases were successfully performed. It took 30 to 178 seconds to finish the exposure procedure. In the Hem-o-lok group, less trocar usage, shorter operation time, and better exposure satisfaction were observed than control group (P\u2009<\u2009.05).\nThis new technique is feasible and easy to improve surgical view in retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery for renal cell carcinoma. This technique may be helpful to shorten operation time and avoid the use of the fourth trocar in certain cases. Large scale randomized controlled studies are needed to further prove its efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e17","authors":["Zhang, Chao","Guo, Fei","Wang, Huiqing","Ye, Chen","Zhang, Zhensheng","Yang, Bo","Xu, Chuanliang","Sun, Yinghao"],"doi":"10.1089\/lap.2015.0542","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T10:08:21+00:00","issns":["1092-6429","1557-9034"],"journal":"Journal of Laparoendoscopic & Advanced Surgical Techniques","last_mentioned_on":1493978885,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27575462?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27575462","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The Application of Hem-O-Lok Clips Tied with Threads to Improve Surgical View in Retroperitoneal Laparoscopic Surgery for Renal Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-hemolok-clips-tied-threads-improve-surgical-view-retroperitoneal-laparoscopic-surgery-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236494,"mean":12.551156465519,"rank":192288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236494,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":1.174880952381,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1703703703704,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/miurologa\/statuses\/860435927079845888","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19870193],"posted_on":"2017-05-05T10:08:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Dra Catalina Solano","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/907352996257964032\/lcflYr9t_normal.jpg","description":"Especialista en Urolog\u00eda | Inter\u00e9s en Endourolog\u00eda y minima invasi\u00f3n | Consultas 3262727 Opc.3-Opc.111 #Urolog\u00eda #Urology #Endourology #WCE17","id_on_source":"miurologa","tweeter_id":"804992912962547712","geo":{"lt":6.25184,"ln":-75.56359,"country":"CO"},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"860435927079845888"}]}}
