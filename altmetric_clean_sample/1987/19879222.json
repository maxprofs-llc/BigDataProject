To date, there has only been one small comparative study of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment.\nFrom 2004 to 2014, 109 patients presenting with coccygodynia were treated with either total coccygectomy or a nonsurgical course of sitting aids, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and injections. All had at least 2 years of symptoms before surgery. The patient principally made the treatment decision, counseled by the treating physician. Before surgery, all subjects underwent at least 2 years of conservative treatment and three-dimensional imaging (computed tomography and\/or magnetic resonance imaging). Subjects completed visual analog pain scales, EuroQol five-dimension, components of the PROMIS measure, and a novel Coccygodynia Disability Index evaluation. Work status, complications, and satisfaction were recorded.\nA total of 61 patients received nonsurgical care; eight declined participation and five could not be located. Forty-eight patients underwent total coccygectomy; three declined participation and five could not be located. At an average 4.8 years of follow-up (range: 2-9), the nonsurgical visual analog pain scales was 5 and the surgical 2 (P\u200a=\u200a0.001); 79% of surgically treated patients were improved at 2 years versus 43% for the nonsurgical group. EuroQol five-dimension (P\u200a=\u200a0.002), Coccygodynia Disability Index (0.01), and PROMIS Pain interference scores (0.02) were also significantly improved in the surgical group. Eleven surgical patients (26%) had complications, all wound related with successful resolution; seven treated with dressing changes and four with surgical debridement.\nTotal coccygectomy is a safe and effective surgical treatment of coccygodynia refractory to nonoperative care. Patient-reported outcome measures were improved after surgery compared with nonsurgical management. Postoperative wound care remains a concern.\n4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Kleimeyer, John P.","Wood, Kirkham B.","L\u00f8nne, Greger","Herzog, Tyler","Ju, Kevin","Beyer, Lisa","Park, Christine","John P.
