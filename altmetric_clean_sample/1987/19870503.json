Inflammation is triggered by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which are activated by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Nme contains multiple PAMPs including lipooligosaccharide, peptidoglycan, proteins and metabolites. Various classes of PRRs including Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, C-type lectins, scavenger receptors, pentraxins and others are expressed by the host to respond to any given microbe. While Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors are pivotal in triggering inflammation, other PRRs act as modulators of inflammation or aid in functional anti-microbial responses such as phagocytosis or complement activation. This review aims to give an overview of the various Nme PAMPs reported to date, the PRRs they activate and their implications during the inflammatory response to infection.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b457a","authors":["Kay Johswich"],"doi":"10.1093\/femspd\/ftx022","first_seen_on":"2017-05-05T10:15:23+00:00","issns":["2049-632X"],"journal":"Pathogens and Disease","last_mentioned_on":1493979304,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28334203?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28334203","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Innate immune recognition and inflammation in Neisseria meningitidis infection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/innate-immune-recognition-inflammation-neisseria-meningitidis-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":7063041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236494,"mean":12.551155408405,"rank":192288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236494,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":3.2814161490683,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.9933333333333,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
