The original signal was delivered to the left ear. The right ear received either no input, one of three CI simulations in which the insertion depth was varied, or the original signal. Speech and noise were presented at either front, left, or right.\nTen Mandarin-speaking NH listeners with pure-tone thresholds less than 20\u2009dB HL.\nRelative to no input in the right ear, the CI simulations provided significant improvements in head shadow benefit for all insertion depths, as well as better spatial release of masking (SRM) for the deepest simulated insertion. There were no significant improvements in summation or squelch for any of the CI simulations.\nThe benefits of cochlear implantation were largely limited to head shadow, with some benefit for SRM. The greatest benefits were observed for the deepest simulated CI insertion, suggesting that reducing mismatch between acoustic and electric hearing may increase the benefit of cochlear implantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b21","authors":["Zhou, Xiaoqing","Li, Huajun","Galvin, John J","Fu, Qian-Jie","Yuan, Wei"],"doi":"10.1080\/14992027.2016.1197426","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-07-03T03:26:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-8186","1499-2027"],"journal":"International Journal of Audiology","last_mentioned_on":1467469473,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27367147?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27367147","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Effects of insertion depth on spatial speech perception in noise for simulations of cochlear implants and single-sided deafness","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-insertion-depth-spatial-speech-perception-noise-simulations-cochlear-implants-singlesided-de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":6902085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260338,"mean":11.505048571659,"rank":218608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260338,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":631,"mean":2.752346031746,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":631,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.575,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
