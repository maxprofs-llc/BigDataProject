Group A included 49 patients who were treated with chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy 3-4 weeks after surgery. Group B included 47 patients treated with 131I-chTNT and PMCT sequentially, with follow-up chemotherapy.\nThe survival rates of patients in group A for the first and second years were 79.59% and 48.98%, respectively. The median survival was 23.0 months. Survival rates at 1 and 2 years for group B were 82.98% and 53.19%, respectively and the median survival was 29.1 months. The survival rate of group B patients for the first and second years was better compared with group A, and the difference in median survival between the groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). However, median survival and the incidence of adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.\n131I-chTNT radioimmunotherapy with PMCT has a complementary effect in NSCLC, which can effectively improve therapeutic ratio and survival of patients effectively and has the same effect as that of post-operative adjuvant chemoradiation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc7e","authors":["Zhao, Zilin","Su, Zhenmin","Zhang, Wangfeng","Luo, Min","Wang, Hongzhi","Huang, Liangyan"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-02T21:21:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1107-0625"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of B U ON official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1467454751,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27273941?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27273941","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A randomized study comparing the effectiveness of microwave ablation radioimmunotherapy and postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-study-comparing-effectiveness-microwave-ablation-radioimmunotherapy-postoperative-adjuvan-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":4187898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2227150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260709,"mean":11.506166914709,"rank":141633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260709,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":1.1250381679389,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.77,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumImmTx_papers\/statuses\/749185644484714496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9180264],"posted_on":"2016-07-02T10:19:11+00:00","author":{"name":"TumImmTxpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"TumImmTx_papers","tweeter_id":"2881001471","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":15},"tweet_id":"749185644484714496"}]}}
