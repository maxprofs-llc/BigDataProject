This column describes the Day Hospital for Adolescents (DHA) of the Institute of Mental Health in Belgrade, Serbia, which was established in December 2007. The DHA is a holistic program for the treatment of youths ages 15-25 with emotional disorders. The multicomponent therapeutic program includes individual treatment, several group therapeutic activities, and work with patients' families and the school system. An evaluation of data obtained for 102 patients indicated that DHA treatment was associated with significant reductions in depression symptom severity and improved functioning. The adolescents reported a high level of treatment satisfaction. The results suggest that a multicomponent day hospital is an effective treatment modality for adolescents with emotional disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c6a","authors":["Zagorka Bradic"],"doi":"10.1176\/appi.ps.201600089","first_seen_on":"2016-07-03T00:00:53+00:00","issns":["1557-9700","1075-2730"],"journal":"Psychiatric Services","last_mentioned_on":1470143196,"links":["http:\/\/ps.psychiatryonline.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1176\/appi.ps.201600089?af=R","http:\/\/psychiatryonline.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1176\/appi.ps.201600089?af=R"],"pmid":"27133728","pubdate":"2016-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"appi.ps.2016000","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Multicomponent Treatment in a Day Hospital for Adolescents: A Case of Good Practice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multicomponent-treatment-day-hospital-adolescents-case-good-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":7058993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261526,"mean":11.640121441544,"rank":217599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261526,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2253,"mean":7.2073641207815,"rank":2014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2253,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":10.091792207792,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
