The basics of wound healing are discussed in addition to the etiology of keloids and the cauliflower ear. Many auricular scars can be revised with scar excision techniques, but separate discussions for the treatment of keloids and the cauliflower ear are provided. The management plan for auricular scarring requires appropriate patient counseling regarding the risk of recurrence in keloids, regrowth of scar tissue in cauliflower ears, scar hypertrophy at the line of closure, widening of the scar, and persisting ear contour deformities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f6100073ed","authors":["Deborah Watson","Bharat Panuganti"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsc.2016.08.006","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T22:33:40+00:00","issns":["10647406"],"issue":"1","journal":"Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1495571828,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27888895?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27888895","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Treating Scars in the Auricle Region","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treating-scars-auricle-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237280,"mean":12.123703049996,"rank":192374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":1.2391428571429,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
