CO is used to grade cardiac function and is especially important when investigating cardiac injury (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI]). Critically, MI deforms the LV, invalidating the assumptions fundamental to calculating of cardiac volumes directly from the LV. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if Doppler-derived blood flow through the pulmonary trunk (pulmonary flow [PF]) was an improved method over conventional LV-dependent echocardiography to accurately determine CO after MI.\nVariations in CO were induced either by transverse aortic constriction or MI. Echocardiography was performed in healthy (n\u00a0=\u00a027), transverse aortic constriction (n\u00a0=\u00a025), and MI (n\u00a0=\u00a041) mice. CO calculated from PF (pulsed-wave Doppler) was internally compared with CO calculated from left ventricular images using M-mode (Teichholz formula) and the single-plane ellipsoid two-dimensional (2D) formula and externally compared with the gold standard, flow probe CO.\nIn healthy mice, all three echocardiographic methods (M-mode, 2D, and PF) correlated well with flow probe-derived CO. In MI mice, only PF CO values correlated well with flow probe values. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed that PF was improved over M-mode and 2D echocardiography. Inter- and intrauser variability of PF CO was reduced, and both inter- and intraclass correlation coefficients were improved compared with either M-mode or 2D CO calculations.\nPF CO calculated from pulsed-wave Doppler through the pulmonary trunk was an improved method\u00a0of estimating CO over LV-dependent formulas after MI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ac0","authors":["Mathew J.
