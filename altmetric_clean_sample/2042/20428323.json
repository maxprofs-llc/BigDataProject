Other functional phenotypes, such as functional tremor and functional gait impairment, may coexist. Although neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of FP, supportive historical clues include the sudden onset of symptoms and absent or nonphysiologic response to levodopa. In selected cases where examination features remain insufficient to render a clinically definite FP diagnosis, normal dopaminergic transporter imaging (DAT scan) confirms \"laboratory supported\" FP. The management of FP begins with diagnostic debriefing, as the full acceptance of the diagnosis is critical in ensuring patient involvement in individualized psychoeducation, psychotherapy, and physical and occupational therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003510","authors":["Kathrin LaFaver","Alberto Espay"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0037-1601487","first_seen_on":"2017-05-24T05:21:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0271-8235","1098-9021"],"issue":"2","journal":"Seminars in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1495790354,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28511263"],"pmid":"28511263","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional (Psychogenic) Parkinsonism","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-treatment-functional-psychogenic-parkinsonism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.4,"score_history":{"1y":5.4,"6m":5.4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":1520689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6747236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238116,"mean":12.131181109968,"rank":57429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238116,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":3.9620737704918,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.57,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":3,"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/samstebbings18\/statuses\/868033776911347712","license":"gnip","rt":["LaFaverMD"],"citation_ids":[20428323],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T09:19:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Samstebbings","url":"https:\/\/www.mixcloud.com\/thechanger93\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/864056675245989888\/EUbw_GMI_normal.jpg","description":"producer, broadcaster , media entrepreneur and WRL player . \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfd0\ud83c\udfc9\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7and club ambassador for Keighley Cougars rugby league club.","id_on_source":"samstebbings18","tweeter_id":"2977435582","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":878},"tweet_id":"868033776911347712"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LaFaverMD\/statuses\/867170821881638913","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20428323],"posted_on":"2017-05-24T00:10:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Kathrin LaFaver","url":"http:\/\/www.uoflphysicians.com\/1528188836-kathrin-lafaver","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/866376811206385666\/53JkDSPR_normal.jpg","description":"Neurologist, Director of the Parkinson's and Movement Disorders Clinic at University of Louisville.
