Participants were 413 Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth study youth, aged 12.6 \u00b1 3.3 years. Monthly ratings of relationships (parents, siblings, and friends) and mood episode severity were assessed by the Adolescent Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation Psychosocial Functioning Schedule and Psychiatric Rating Scales, on average, every 8.2 months over 5.1 years. Correlations examined whether participants with increased episode severity also reported poorer relationships and whether fluctuations in episode severity predicted fluctuations in relationships, and vice versa. Results indicated that participants with greater mood episode severity also had worse relationships. Longitudinally, participants had largely stable relationships. To the extent that there were associations, changes in parental relationships may precede changes in episode severity, although the magnitude of this finding was small. Findings have implications for relationship interventions in BP youth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e6f","authors":["Siegel RS","Hoeppner B","Yen S","Stout RL","Weinstock LM","Hower HM","Birmaher B","Goldstein TR","Goldstein BI","Hunt JI","Strober M","Axelson DA","Gill MK","Keller MB"],"doi":"10.1097\/nmd.0000000000000261","first_seen_on":"2015-02-27T15:09:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-3018"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease","last_mentioned_on":1426342730,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Abstract\/2015\/03000\/Longitudinal_Associations_Between_Interpersonal.8.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/Fulltext\/2015\/03000\/Longitudinal_Associations_Between_Interpersonal.8.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jonmd\/2015\/03000\/Longitudinal_Associations_Between_Interpersonal.8.pdf","pmid":"25668652","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"194","subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Longitudinal Associations Between Interpersonal Relationship Functioning and Mood Episode Severity in Youth With Bipolar Disorder","type":"article","volume":"203","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longitudinal-associations-between-interpersonal-relationship-functioning-mood-episode-severity-youth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868747,"mean":5.7971828146335,"rank":1047861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3811117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868747,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146030,"mean":9.9955301618174,"rank":41229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":104357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146030,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1404,"mean":3.3878488952245,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1404,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":7.7801904761905,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
