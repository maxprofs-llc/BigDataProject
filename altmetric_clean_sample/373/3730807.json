It may lead to changes in behaviour (aggressive or passive) and consequently to bullying behaviour. Our aim was to assess the association between body image dissatisfaction and involvement in bullying and whether this differs by gender. We used data from the Slovak part of the 2010 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study. The final sample comprised 8050 adolescents aged 11 to 15\u00a0years old (mean age 13.57), less than half of whom were boys. The association between self-reported body image and involvement in bullying was determined using multinomial logistic regression. We found a significant association between body dissatisfaction and involvement in bullying. Adolescents dissatisfied with their bodies because due to feeling overweight were more likely to become passive or reactive victims. Self-reported thinness was found to be significantly associated with bully-victims only in boys. Conclusion: Adolescent body dissatisfaction is strongly associated with bullying behaviour. Our findings point out the importance of incorporating at schools different types of intervention programmes supporting positive self-perceptions of adolescents and reducing bullying behaviour. What is known: \u2022 Involvement in bullying increases the risk of unhealthy development of adolescents. \u2022 This study confirms previous evidence that adolescents dissatisfied with their bodies due to feeling overweight are more likely to be involved in bullying as passive or reactive victims. What is new: \u2022 Negative body image because of thinness was found to be associated with bullying behaviour of adolescents. \u2022 We found gender differences in the relationship between body image dissatisfaction and bullying behaviour: boys feeling too thin were at greater risk of becoming a reactive victim.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002849","authors":["Jana Holubcikova","Peter Kolarcik","Andrea Madarasova Geckova","Jitse P Van Dijk","Sijmen A Reijneveld","Holubcikova J","Kolarcik P","Madarasova Geckova A","Van Dijk JP","Reijneveld SA"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00431-015-2507-7","endpage":"1041","first_seen_on":"2015-02-25T11:49:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-1076","0340-6199"],"issue":"8","journal":"European Journal of Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1466957529,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25708851?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00431-015-2507-7","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00431-015-2507-7"],"pmid":"25708851","pubdate":"2015-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1035","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Is subjective perception of negative body image among adolescents associated with bullying?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00431-015-2507-7","volume":"174","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subjective-perception-negative-body-image-among-adolescents-associated-bullying"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7947684,"mean":6.7156263575118,"rank":1884196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6025908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7947684,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203769,"mean":9.1240009618782,"rank":58672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":144054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203769,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1512,"mean":3.1616280608868,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1512,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.275,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
