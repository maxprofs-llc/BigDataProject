Adrenal venous sampling is considered the standard for reliably distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral hormone secretion, with unilateral secretion being surgically curable. Success of adrenal vein sampling relies on appropriate patient selection, patient preparation, and recognition and catheterization of both adrenal veins. However, this procedure may prove technically challenging, particularly for inexperienced operators. This video (see Fig; available online at www.jvir.org) is designed to provide the viewer with details on the technical aspects of adrenal vein sampling by using the sequential technique in an immersive format with real-time table-top teaching. Indications, patient preparation, equipment selection, technique, and quality assurance are reviewed in detail, with the goal of providing practitioners an opportunity to successfully incorporate this procedure into their practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f16","authors":["Harsha A","Trerotola SO"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jvir.2014.11.006","first_seen_on":"2015-02-26T22:33:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1051-0443"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1424994696,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jvir.org%2Farticle%2FS1051-0443%252814%252901066-5%2Faddons&code=jvir-site","http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S1051-0443(14)01066-5\/addons"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jvir.org\/article\/S1051044314010665\/pdf","pmid":"25645412","pubdate":"2015-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"239","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Technical Aspects of Adrenal Vein Sampling","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/technical-aspects-adrenal-vein-sampling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4809133,"mean":5.7523593792002,"rank":1965914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2818996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4809133,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144524,"mean":10.038591545983,"rank":56988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":86403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144524,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":864,"mean":3.8833163383546,"rank":440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":864,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":6.0575,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
