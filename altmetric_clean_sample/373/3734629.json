Spirituality is a resource that supports adaptation and resilience to improve quality of life in patients with cancer or other chronic illnesses. For Latinos, spirituality is an important core cultural value. As such, it is crucial to pay close attention to how cultural values play a role in health-related concerns when caring for Latino cancer patients, and to how spirituality, being an important aspect of Latino culture, influences how Latinos adjust and cope with cancer. Understanding how to facilitate resilience in the face of potentially negative life events, such as cancer, can not only help Latino cancer patients in active treatment, but can also impact effectiveness of managing and coping with the consequences of cancer during survivorship.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f00","authors":["Migda Hunter-Hern\u00e1ndez","Rosario Costas-Mu\u00f1\u00edz","Francesca Gany","Hunter-Hern\u00e1ndez M","Costas-Mu\u00f1\u00edz R","Gany F"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10943-015-0020-y","endpage":"2375","first_seen_on":"2015-02-26T11:50:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1573-6571","0022-4197"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Religion & Health","last_mentioned_on":1446172233,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25711211?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10943-015-0020-y"],"pmid":"25711211","pubdate":"2015-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Religious Studies","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"startpage":"2367","subjects":["medicine","ethics"],"title":"Missed Opportunity: Spirituality as a Bridge to Resilience in Latinos with Cancer","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/missed-opportunity-spirituality-bridge-resilience-latinos-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6507444,"mean":6.0294063692903,"rank":2407819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4002056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6507444,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172968,"mean":9.7529298189829,"rank":68884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":100492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172968,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":7.5402863741339,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.9276842105263,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
