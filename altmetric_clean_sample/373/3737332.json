We have previously developed a vascular scaffold fabricated by electrospinning poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and type I collagen that mimics the structural and biomechanical properties of native vessels. In this study, we investigated whether a smooth muscle cell (SMC) sheet could be combined with the electrospun vascular scaffolds to produce a more mature smooth muscle layer as compared to the conventional cell seeding method. The pre-fabricated SMC sheet, wrapped around the vascular scaffold, provided high cell seeding efficiency (approx. 100%) and a mature smooth muscle layer that expressed strong cell-to-cell junction, connexin 43 (CX43), and contractile proteins, \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Moreover, bioreactor-associated preconditioning of the SMC sheet-combined vascular scaffold maintained high cell viability (95.9\u00b12.7%) and phenotypes and improved cellular infiltration and mechanical properties (35.7% of tensile strength, 47.5% of elasticity, and 113.2% of elongation at break).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","doi":"10.1016\/j.actbio.2015.01.030","first_seen_on":"2015-02-27T05:31:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["17427061"],"journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","last_mentioned_on":1425082855,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1742706115000409"],"pmid":"25641646","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Engineered small diameter vascular grafts by combining cell sheet engineering and electrospinning technology ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineered-small-diameter-vascular-grafts-combining-cell-sheet-engineering-electrospinning-technolog"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4811984,"mean":5.7519713552635,"rank":3217370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1403845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4811984,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143624,"mean":10.072652680977,"rank":96787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":40247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143624,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":3.1530975254731,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.6208333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
