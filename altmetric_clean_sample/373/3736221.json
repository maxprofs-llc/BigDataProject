Here, we demonstrate structured illumination microscopy through 35 \u03bcm of tissue using adaptive optics (AO) to correct aberrations resulting in images with a resolution of 140 nm. We report a 60% minimum improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the structured illumination reconstruction through thick tissue by correction with AO.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd0","authors":["Benjamin Thomas","Adrian Wolstenholme","Snehal N Chaudhari","Edward T Kipreos","Peter Kner","Snehal N.
