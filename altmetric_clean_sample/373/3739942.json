When a picture is viewed from other locations, the retinal image specifies a different scene, but we normally do not notice the changes. We investigated the mechanism underlying this perceptual invariance by studying the perceived shapes of pictured objects viewed from various locations. We also manipulated information about the orientation of the picture surface. When binocular information for surface orientation was available, perceived shape was nearly invariant across a wide range of viewing angles. By varying the projection angle and the position of a stimulus in the picture, we found that invariance is achieved through an estimate of local surface orientation, not from geometric information in the picture. We present a model that explains invariance and other phenomena (such as perceived distortions in wide-angle pictures).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Dhanraj Vishwanath","Ahna R Girshick","Martin S Banks","Vishwanath D","Girshick AR","Banks MS"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn1553","endpage":"1410","first_seen_on":"2015-02-27T21:30:09+00:00","issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1425063900,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v8\/n10\/abs\/nn1553.html"],"pmcid":"PMC2727473","pmid":"16172600","pubdate":"2005-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1401","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Why pictures look right when viewed from the wrong place","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nn1553","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pictures-look-right-viewed-wrong-place"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4811984,"mean":5.7519713552635,"rank":884023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3905805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4811984,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143622,"mean":10.072780763259,"rank":35619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":107624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143622,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2959,"mean":22.607985801217,"rank":1487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2959,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":77.410405405405,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
