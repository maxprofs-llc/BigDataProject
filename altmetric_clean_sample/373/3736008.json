Methadone lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner with 20\u00a0mg\/kg yielding a nadir in average glucose levels to 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0mg\/dL from a baseline of 172\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0mg\/dL, an effect that was antagonized by naloxone and mu selective antagonists \u03b2-funaltrexamine and naloxonazine. The effect was stereoselective and limited to only the l-isomer, while the d-isomer was ineffective. Despite the robust decrease in blood glucose produced by methadone, a series of other mu-opioids, including morphine, fentanyl, levorphanol, oxycodone or morphine-6\u03b2-glucuronide failed to lower blood glucose levels. Similar differences among mu-opioid agonists have been observed in other systems, suggesting the possible role of selected splice variants of the mu-opioid receptor gene Oprm1. This mouse model recapitulates our clinical observations and emphasizes the need to carefully monitor glucose levels when using high methadone doses, particularly intravenously, and the need for controlled clinical trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["Faskowitz AJ","Kramskiy VN","Pasternak GW"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10571-013-9919-6","endpage":"542","first_seen_on":"2015-02-26T19:19:32+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1573-6830","0272-4340"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1450290928,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23467779","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10571-013-9919-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23467779\/"],"pmid":"23467779","pubdate":"2013-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"537","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Methadone-Induced Hypoglycemia.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/methadoneinduced-hypoglycemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6777408,"mean":6.1700063558217,"rank":1030047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5744055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6777408,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197848,"mean":8.9080639382959,"rank":39796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":157881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197848,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":2.3791833740831,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.4347826086957,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
