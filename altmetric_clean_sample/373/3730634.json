An imbalance of neuronal proteostasis, associated with protein misfolding and aggregation, leads to proteinopathies or neurodegeneration. While genetic variations and protein modifications contribute to aggregate formation, components of the proteostasis network dictate the fate of protein aggregates. Here we provide an overview of proteostasis pathways and their interplay (particularly autophagy) with the metabolism of disease-related proteins. We review recent studies on neuronal activity-mediated regulation of proteostasis and transcellular propagation of protein aggregates in the nervous system. Targeting proteostasis pathways therapeutically remains an attractive but challenging task.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f0","authors":["Junghyun Lim","Zhenyu Yue"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2015.02.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-25T11:21:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-1551"],"issue":"4","journal":"Developmental Cell","last_mentioned_on":1428094311,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25710535?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25710535"],"pmid":"25710535","pubdate":"2015-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Neuronal Aggregates: Formation, Clearance, and Spreading.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuronal-aggregates-formation-clearance-spreading"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4953575,"mean":5.8708535421125,"rank":517859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4428846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4953575,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149251,"mean":10.026687624791,"rank":24704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":124164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149251,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1777,"mean":6.6449245495495,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1777,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":14.485914893617,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
