In this report, we present a 16 months old female patient in whom cardiac catheterization had been performed which had revealed a segment of coarctation and saccular aneurysm in the descending aorta. The patient was operated and a 3x2 centimeters aneurysm which embraces the coarcted segment in descending aorta was resected. In summary, we present a case of saccular aortic aneurysm distal to aortic coarctation in an infant without any history of intervention or vascular inflammatory disease. Our case report seems to be the youngest patient in literature with this pathology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d3d37a86a348c7778b45e7","authors":["Arda Ozyuksel","Emir Canturk","Aygun Dindar","Atif Akcevin"],"doi":"10.5935\/1678-9741.20140041","first_seen_on":"2015-02-27T12:27:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1678-9741"],"issue":"4","journal":"Applied Adhesion Science","last_mentioned_on":1425039999,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25714219"],"pmid":"25714219","subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Saccular aneurysm formation of the descending aorta associated with aortic coarctation in an infant.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/saccular-aneurysm-formation-descending-aorta-associated-aortic-coarctation-infant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4811984,"mean":5.7519713552635,"rank":3408144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":783611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4811984,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143622,"mean":10.072780763259,"rank":103376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":24914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143622,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.765625,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Peertechz\/status\/571285279861919744","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3738507],"posted_on":"2015-02-27T12:26:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Peertechz Pub PvtLtd","url":"https:\/\/www.peertechz.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/808685119959535616\/cV4vMlOy_normal.jpg","description":"Peertechz Publications Pvt.
