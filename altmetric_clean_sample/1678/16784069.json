Ninety-three % of HIV+ infants were receiving antiretroviral therapy prior to vaccination. Participants were followed for safety. Immune responses were measured 14 days after three doses of RV5, including serum anti-rotavirus neutralizing and IgA antibodies; IgA antibody in stool; and anti-rotavirus memory B- and T-cell Fluorospot. Shedding of RV5 in stool was monitored.\n76 HIV+ and 126 HEU infants were enrolled from 2009-2013. No significant differences were found in adverse event rates, including grade 3 events, between RV5 and placebo recipients, for either HIV+ or HEU infants. The proportion of anti-rotavirus IgA responders (\u22653-fold increase from baseline) after RV5 administration was 81% in both HIV+ and HEU infants, which was approximately 2.5-fold higher than in placebo recipients (p\u200a<\u200a0.001). Neutralizing antibody responses to 3 of 5 serotypes were significantly higher after RV5 regardless of HIV status, and those of HIV+ infants were equal or greater than responses of HEU infants to all 5 serotypes. Only one HIV+ RV5 recipient had RV5 isolated from stool.\nRV5 was immunogenic in both HIV+ and HEU infants and no safety signals were observed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Myron J.
