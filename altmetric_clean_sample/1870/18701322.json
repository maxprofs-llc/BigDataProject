Our goal is to understand whether climatic conditions contribute to mortality after considering social conditions and to investigate whether spatial non-stationarity exists in these factors. Applying geographically weighted regression to a unique nationwide county-level dataset, we found that (1) net of other factors, average July temperatures are positively (detrimentally) associated with mortality while January temperatures mainly have a curvilinear relationship, (2) the mortality-climatic condition associations are spatially non-stationary, (3) the relationships between social conditions (e.g., social capital) and mortality are stable geographically, and (4) without a spatial approach to understanding the environment-mortality relationship, important spatial variations are overlooked. Our findings suggest that a universal approach to coping with the relationships between rapid climate changes and health may not be appropriate and effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003368","authors":["Tse-Chuan Yang","Leif Jensen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11111-016-0262-y","first_seen_on":"2017-04-10T16:35:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0199-0039","1573-7810"],"issue":"3","journal":"Population & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1491842106,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11111-016-0262-y"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11111-016-0262-y.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5374511","pmid":"28373741","pubdate":"2016-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Demography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Population Economics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Climatic conditions and human mortality: spatial and regional variation in the United States","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/climatic-conditions-human-mortality-spatial-regional-variation-united-states-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":5815382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1937013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235668,"mean":12.850063394535,"rank":153489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":68333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235668,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":6.4572985074627,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":17.566666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psupopresearch\/statuses\/851473624502611969","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18701322],"posted_on":"2017-04-10T16:35:06+00:00","author":{"name":"PRI","url":"http:\/\/www.pop.psu.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/662002755293196288\/-iPnxUgI_normal.jpg","description":"The Population Research Institute (PRI) at Penn State University encourages, organizes, and supports innovative research & training in the population sciences.","id_on_source":"psupopresearch","tweeter_id":"1128512070","geo":{"lt":-17,"ln":-65,"country":"BO"},"followers":437},"tweet_id":"851473624502611969"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Climatic conditions and human mortality: spatial and regional variation in the United States","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1115079298596483&id=370264773077943","license":"public","citation_ids":[18701322],"posted_on":"2017-04-10T16:35:00+00:00","summary":"Temperature & Mortality: How are climate conditions associated with mortality after considering social conditions?
