Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +\/- 16 vs. 123 +\/- 20 beats\/min, p less than 0.05). Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +\/- 2.0 vs. 1.6 +\/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect. Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +\/- 2.2 vs. 2.6 +\/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%). Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations. Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia. Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction. Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo. These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f57","authors":["Bairey, C N","Krantz, D S","DeQuattro, V","Berman, D S","Rozanski, A","C.
