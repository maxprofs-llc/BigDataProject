We hypothesized that BMI, body fat and waist circumference would be highly correlated and all would be associated with aggressive PC, but not overall risk.\nA case (483) -control (496) study among men undergoing prostate biopsy from 2007-2016 was conducted at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Anthropometric measurements and self-reported were taken. Percent body fat was measured. Associations between adiposity measures and PC risk and high-grade PC (Gleason \u22657) were examined using logistic regression.\nBMI, percent body fat, and waist circumference were highly correlated (\u03c1 \u22650.79) (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, BMI (p=0.011) was associated with overall PC risk, but percent body fat (p=0.16) and waist circumference (p=0.19) were not. However, all adiposity measurements were associated with high-grade disease (p<0.001). We found a strong relationship between self-reported and measured weight (\u03c1=0.97) and height (\u03c1=0.92).\nBMI, body fat and waist circumference were all highly correlated and associated with aggressive PC. This study supports the idea that higher adiposity is selectively associated with high-grade PC and reinforces the continued use of self-reported BMI as a measure of obesity in epidemiological studies of PC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Guerrios-Rivera, Lourdes","Howard, Lauren","Frank, Jennifer","De Hoedt, Amanda","Beverly, Devon","Grant, Delores J","Hoyo, Cathrine","Freedland, Stephen J","Lourdes Guerrios-Rivera","Lauren Howard","Jennifer Frank","Amanda De Hoedt","Devon Beverly","Delores J.
