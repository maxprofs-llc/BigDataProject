Thus, free-range pigs can develop subclinical infections and may contribute to disease spread to bovine and wildlife. Serodiagnosis has been proposed as a screening tool for detecting infected pig herds; however, the value of this method to obtain an accurate diagnosis in this species is still not clear. In this study, sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) estimates of four ELISAs and a lateral flow immunochromatographic antibody assay based on different M. bovis antigens, including MPB70 and MPB83 proteins, were evaluated in naturally infected domestic free-range pigs. For this purpose, submandibular lymph nodes and blood samples from 217 pigs from both TB-infected and historically negative farms were sampled at slaughterhouse and analysed by gross examination, histopathology, bacteriological culture and qPCR. Se and Sp estimates of the 5 evaluated assays ranged from 66.1% to 78% (CI95 from 52.6 to 87.7%) and from 98.9% to 100% (CI95 from 93.8 to 100%), respectively. Results of our study suggest that all the evaluated assays could be used as a first screening tool to conduct bTB surveillance in domestic pigs at population level; however, animals from seropositive herds should later be surveyed by other methods in order to reduce false negative results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003384","authors":["Fernando Cardoso-Toset","Inmaculada Luque","Librado Carrasco","Francisco Jurado-Martos","Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Risalde","\u00c1ngel Venteo","Jos\u00e9 A.
