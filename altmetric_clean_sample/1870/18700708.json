Notably, recent studies have highlighted associations between HERVs expression and cancers (Yu et al., Int J Mol Med 32, 2013), autoimmunity (Balada et al., Int Rev Immunol 29:351-370, 2010) and neurological (Christensen, J Neuroimmune Pharmacol 5:326-335, 2010) conditions. Their repetitive nature makes their study particularly challenging, where expression studies have largely focused on individual loci (De Parseval et al., J Virol 77:10414-10422, 2003) or general trends within families (Forsman et al., J Virol Methods 129:16-30, 2005; Seifarth et al., J Virol 79:341-352, 2005; Pichon et al., Nucleic Acids Res 34:e46, 2006).\nTo refine our understanding of HERVs activity, we introduce here a new microarray, HERV-V3. This work was made possible by the careful detection and annotation of genomic HERV\/MaLR sequences as well as the development of a new hybridization model, allowing the optimization of probe performances and the control of cross-reactions.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff RESULTS: HERV-V3 offers an almost complete coverage of HERVs and their ancestors (mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons, MaLRs) at the locus level along with four other repertoires (active LINE-1 elements, lncRNA, a selection of 1559 human genes and common infectious viruses). We demonstrate that HERV-V3 analytical performances are comparable with commercial Affymetrix arrays, and that for a selection of tissue\/pathological specific loci, the patterns of expression measured on HERV-V3 is consistent with those reported in the literature.\nGiven its large HERVs\/MaLRs coverage and additional repertoires, HERV-V3 opens the door to multiple applications such as enhancers and alternative promoters identification, biomarkers identification as well as the characterization of genes and HERVs\/MaLRs modulation caused by viral infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Becker, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie","P\u00e9rot, Philippe","Cheynet, Val\u00e9rie","Oriol, Guy","Mugnier, Nathalie","Mommert, Marine","Tabone, Olivier","Textoris, Julien","Veyrieras, Jean-Baptiste","Mallet, Fran\u00e7ois","J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Becker","Philippe P\u00e9rot","Val\u00e9rie Cheynet","Guy Oriol","Nathalie Mugnier","Marine Mommert","Olivier Tabone","Julien Textoris","Jean-Baptiste Veyrieras","Fran\u00e7ois Mallet"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12864-017-3669-7","first_seen_on":"2017-04-10T16:00:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1505210920,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28390408","https:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12864-017-3669-7","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28390408?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12864-017-3669-7?site=bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28390408","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"286","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"A comprehensive hybridization model allows whole HERV transcriptome profiling using high density microarray","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-hybridization-model-allows-whole-herv-transcriptome-profiling-using-high-density-micro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8404159,"mean":7.075409750737,"rank":4487475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2339549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8404159,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250112,"mean":13.020818980372,"rank":140299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250112,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5937,"mean":4.2017277628032,"rank":3770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5937,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":9.1117173913043,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
