Denture teeth of each type were processed on an injection molded resin (IvoBase HI; Ivoclar Vivadent AG) or a compression molded resin (Lucitone 199; Dentsply Intl) (n=11 or 12). The denture teeth were loaded at 45 degrees on the incisal edge. The failure load was recorded and analyzed with 2-way ANOVA (\u03b1=.05), and the fracture mode was categorized from observed fracture surfaces as cohesive, adhesive, or mixed failure.\nThe following failure loads (mean \u00b1SD) were recorded: NHC\/injection molded 280 \u00b152 N; IPN\/injection molded 331 \u00b141 N; MRP\/injection molded 247 \u00b123 N; NHC\/compression molded 204 \u00b131 N; IPN\/compression molded 184 \u00b117 N; MRP\/compression molded 201 \u00b116 N. Injection molded resin yielded significantly higher failure strength for all denture teeth (P<.001), among which IPN had the highest strength. Failure was predominantly cohesive in the teeth, with the exception of mixed mode for the IPN\/compression group.\nWhen good bonding was achieved, the strength of the structure (denture tooth\/base resin combination) was determined by the strength of the denture teeth, which may be affected by the processing technique.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a95","authors":["Robison, Nathan E","Tantbirojn, Daranee","Versluis, Antheunis","Cagna, David R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prosdent.2016.02.001","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T09:31:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-6841","00223913"],"journal":"Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1460713381,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0022391316001062&_version=1&md5=ac2ef4bc4d0c403ac58df37b2e27176e"],"pmid":"27061633","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Failure strengths of denture teeth fabricated on injection molded or compression molded denture base resins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/failure-strengths-denture-teeth-fabricated-injection-molded-compression-molded-denture-base-resins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3262667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4206639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268606,"mean":11.351096539528,"rank":112597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":152006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268606,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":534,"mean":1.5169943714822,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":534,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.3116071428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
