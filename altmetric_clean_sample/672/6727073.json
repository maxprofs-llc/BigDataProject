They were divided into 3 groups with 30 cases per group in accordance to the syndrome differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine. The patients underwent arthroscopic surgery, and we categorized the patients having the same characterization in each group, and those having distinct difference into the three groups. Based on the arthroscopic analysis, we performed analysis of statistical data in order to analyze the relation between knee osteoarthritis under arthroscope and traditional Chinese medicine syndromes.\nThere are three syndromes according to traditional Chinese medicine that can be categorized into various different groups. The synovial proliferation can be seen mostly in the syndrome of stagnation of blood stasis. The slight damage of knee joint cartilage can be seen in the syndrome of yang deficiency and cold stagnation, the severe one in the syndrome of kidney-marrow deficiency. We found that there are different pathological expressions with the various degree of the tissues damage at the knee and we categorized the knee according to their syndrome.\nFor knee osteoarthritis, different syndromes of traditional Chinese medicine presents different tissues pathological changes at the knee joint under arthroscopy, which will provide objective basis for the diagnosis of this medical condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fa5","authors":["Tian, Xiangdong","Zhu, Guangyu","Wang, Jian","Wang, Qingfu","Guan, Lei","Tan, Yetong","Xue, Zhipeng","Qin, Lina","Zhang, Jing"],"doi":"10.3233\/xst-160567","first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T05:59:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9114"],"journal":"Journal of X-Ray Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1460699921,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27061796"],"pmid":"27061796","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Study on the relation between tissues pathologies and traditional chinese medicine syndromes in knee osteoarthritis: Medical image diagnostics by preoperative X-ray and surgical arthroscopy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-relation-between-tissues-pathologies-traditional-chinese-medicine-syndromes-knee-osteoarthriti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":5718248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1011298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268607,"mean":11.351112171731,"rank":188534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268607,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.5357142857143,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Ryanfeed_RSS\/statuses\/720853832259899392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6727073],"posted_on":"2016-04-15T05:58:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Ryan W.
