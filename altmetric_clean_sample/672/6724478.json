The lag phase of the JJJ1 deletion mutant BY\u0394JJJ1 was ~16 h shorter than that of the parent strain, BY4741, when the fermentation medium contained 4.5 g acetic acid\/l. Additionally, the specific ethanol production rate of BY\u0394JJJ1 was increased (0.057 g\/g\u00a0h) compared to that of the parent strain (0.051 g\/g\u00a0h). Comparative transcription and physiological analyses revealed higher long chain fatty acid, trehalose, and catalase contents might be critical factors responsible for the acetic acid resistance of JJJ1 knockout strains.\nJJJ1 deletion improves acetic acid tolerance and ethanol fermentation performance of S. cerevisiae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064bd","authors":["Wu, Xuechang","Zhang, Lijie","Jin, Xinna","Fang, Yahong","Zhang, Ke","Qi, Lei","Zheng, Daoqiong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10529-016-2085-4","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T23:45:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6776","0141-5492"],"journal":"Biotechnology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1460677505,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27067354?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27067354","pubdate":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Deletion of JJJ1 improves acetic acid tolerance and bioethanol fermentation performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deletion-jjj1-improves-acetic-acid-tolerance-bioethanol-fermentation-performance-saccharomyces-cerev"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":6540516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269824,"mean":11.371664253974,"rank":227465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269824,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":2.2000038461538,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.49736842105263,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
