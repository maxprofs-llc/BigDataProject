We treated 21 patients with ZES with intravenous P; 13 of these patients were treated surgically in advance. The effect of P was very rapid, with reduction of the acid output within 15 min and its normalization within 60 min. The control of gastric acid secretion was maintained for a mean of 10.9 hours after the infusion of P. We conclude that the use of intravenous P allows a safe and efficient control of the acid ipersecretion in patients with ZES.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc91","authors":["Modlin, I M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-15T05:29:02+00:00","issns":["0034-1193"],"issue":"7-8","journal":"Recenti progressi in medicina","last_mentioned_on":1460698542,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11475787"],"pmid":"11475787","pubdate":"2001-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Efficacy and safety of intravenously administered pantoprazole in the treatment of gastrinoma].","type":"article","volume":"92"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3684463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3678724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268607,"mean":11.351115894656,"rank":134572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":123701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268607,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.8627804878049,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hatfinaa\/statuses\/720846906226683904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6726935],"posted_on":"2016-04-15T05:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"pinyo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/482164705444642817\/EpZpH9if_normal.jpeg","description":"bathroom performer","id_on_source":"hatfinaa","tweeter_id":"70691754","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":227},"tweet_id":"720846906226683904"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hecanhazpdf\/statuses\/720848051892432896","license":"gnip","rt":["hatfinaa"],"citation_ids":[6726935],"posted_on":"2016-04-15T05:35:42+00:00","author":{"name":"shecanhazpdf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/544836075697348608\/cRflBHVx_normal.jpeg","description":"est. 2014 - does nothing but retweeting #icanhazpdf tweets all day long","id_on_source":"hecanhazpdf","tweeter_id":"2924860811","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":747},"tweet_id":"720848051892432896"}]}}
