In a collaboration between Vanderbilt University and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA), the ASRA Coags Regional app was created to be a decision support tool for the 2010 published guideline on regional anesthesia for patients receiving anticoagulation. This is a review of the distribution and usage of this app.\nThe app was created to be a user-friendly version of the guideline. Download statistics were collected from April 2014 to October 2015, and app usage data were collected from October 2014 to October 2015. Usage data were analyzed for number of devices, number of search sessions, medications searched, and types of procedures.\nThere were 8381 downloads, with 83% from North America. Of users who allowed data tracking, 4504 unique devices were identified with 30,003 separate search events. The most searched-for medications were rivaroxaban (n = 4427; 11%), clopidogrel (n = 4042; 10%), and enoxaparin, prophylactic twice daily dosing (n = 3249; 8%). Neuraxial procedures (n = 22,477; 78%) were the most commonly searched-for procedures and over half (n = 22,773; 52%) the users were interested in how long to hold a medication before performing a procedure.\nThis is the first publication of download and usage data concerning medical smartphone apps. It provides a template for future app uptake and use in clinical practice. The app platform provides a new mechanism of rapidly disseminating guidelines and facilitating distribution of frequent updates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c87","authors":["Gupta, Rajnish K.","McEvoy, Matthew D.","Gupta, Rajnish K","McEvoy, Matthew D","Rajnish K.
