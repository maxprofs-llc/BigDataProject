Peanut meal, soluble starch, NaCl, yeast extract, and ammonium sulphate were identified the best ingredient for high antifungal activity of S. diastatochromogenes KX852460 against the R. solani AG-3. For the improved production of secondary metabolites, central composite design of response surface methodology was applied in submerged fermentation. The best concentrations of ingredients were peanut meal 4.88%, soluble starch 4.40%, NaCl 0.52%, yeast extract 0.47%, and ammonium sulphate 0.0360%. Study of metabolism changes in the submerged fermentation process was analyzed. Level of the reducing sugar increased, as the total sugar consumed. Amino nitrogen and total sugar decrease tendency, which indicated the growth of bacteria in submerged fermentation batch. Production of secondary and other metabolites influenced the pH of the fermentation batch.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ac","authors":["Taswar Ahsan","Jianguang Chen","Yuanhua Wu","Muhammad Irfan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13568-017-0388-z","first_seen_on":"2017-05-15T20:10:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2191-0855"],"issue":"1","journal":"AMB Express","last_mentioned_on":1495028887,"links":["https:\/\/amb-express.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13568-017-0388-z?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+amb-express%2FxmvR+%28AMB+Express%29","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28508386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/amb-express.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13568-017-0388-z?site=amb-express.springeropen.com","pmid":"28508386","pubdate":"2017-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","title":"Application of response surface methodology for optimization of medium components for the production of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces diastatochromogenes KX852460","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-response-surface-methodology-optimization-medium-components-production-secondary-metabol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":3886260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4149974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238867,"mean":12.387449004881,"rank":111251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":120321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238867,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":2.0306910569106,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.9371641791045,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/evidknowlcentre\/statuses\/864211460519546883","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20171602],"posted_on":"2017-05-15T20:10:43+00:00","author":{"name":"ekc-nwcsu","url":"http:\/\/www.evidenceknowledgecentre.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/519868569585086465\/Ubj9_r3m_normal.png","description":"Evidence Services at North West CSU","id_on_source":"evidknowlcentre","tweeter_id":"1263882180","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":73},"tweet_id":"864211460519546883"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/864788889575202816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20171602],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T10:25:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":321},"tweet_id":"864788889575202816"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/864839954333016064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20171602],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T13:48:07+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
