The total distance, the crossing pieces, and rearing times in the open-field test of the CUMS group and the CFS group were all less than those of the control group to different degrees. The concentrations of tryptophan, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA of the CUMS group were obviously lower than those of the control group. In the CFS model, the concentrations of tryptophan, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA were obviously higher than those of the control group. The expressions of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH-2) and 5-HT1A receptor in protein level and mRNA level were also different among the three groups. The expressions of TPH-2 and 5-HT1A were higher in the CFS group than in the CUMS group. The expressions of TPH-2 and 5-HT1A receptor were lower in the CUMS group than in the control group. We can find that in different situations of mood disorders, the variation of 5-HT system may also be opposite.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","authors":["Cao, Yin","Li, Qinglin"],"doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0000000000000797","first_seen_on":"2017-05-15T18:35:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0959-4965","1473-558X"],"issue":"11","journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1499406944,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_variation_of_the_5_hydroxytryptamine_system.98586.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/2017\/08020\/The_variation_of_the_5_hydroxytryptamine_system.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/9000\/00000\/The_variation_of_the_5_hydroxytryptamine_system.98586.pdf","pmid":"28505018","pubdate":"2017-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"630","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The variation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine system between chronic unpredictable mild stress rats and chronic fatigue syndrome rats induced by forced treadmill running","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_variation_of_the_5_hydroxytryptamine_system.98586.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":7072730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236620,"mean":12.342609883399,"rank":192165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236620,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1654,"mean":3.5615620084694,"rank":1450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":6.6599310344828,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroReport\/statuses\/864187389786308608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20170332],"posted_on":"2017-05-15T18:35:04+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroReport","url":"http:\/\/www.neuroreport.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826084196036857861\/YhtvNa9Z_normal.jpg","description":"NeuroReport is a channel for rapid communication of new findings in neuroscience.","id_on_source":"NeuroReport","tweeter_id":"482085355","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":933},"tweet_id":"864187389786308608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroReport\/statuses\/880834343488282625","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20170332],"posted_on":"2017-06-30T17:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroReport","url":"http:\/\/www.neuroreport.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826084196036857861\/YhtvNa9Z_normal.jpg","description":"NeuroReport is a channel for rapid communication of new findings in neuroscience.","id_on_source":"NeuroReport","tweeter_id":"482085355","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":933},"tweet_id":"880834343488282625"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroReport\/statuses\/883202853652660224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20170332],"posted_on":"2017-07-07T05:55:44+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroReport","url":"http:\/\/www.neuroreport.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826084196036857861\/YhtvNa9Z_normal.jpg","description":"NeuroReport is a channel for rapid communication of new findings in neuroscience.","id_on_source":"NeuroReport","tweeter_id":"482085355","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":933},"tweet_id":"883202853652660224"}]}}
