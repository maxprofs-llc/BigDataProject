Spirulina dose-dependently inhibited the systemic allergic reaction induced by compound 48\/80 in rats. Spirulina inhibited compound 48\/80-induced allergic reaction 100% with doses of 100-1000 microg\/g body weight, i.p. Spirulina (10-1000 microg\/g body weight, i.p.) also significantly inhibited local allergic reaction activated by anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) IgE. When rats were pretreated with spirulina at a concentration ranging from 0.01 to 1000 microg\/g body weight, i.p., the serum histamine levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Spirulina (0.001 to 10 microg\/mL) dose-dependently inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) activated by compound 48\/80 or anti-DNP IgE. The level of cyclic AMP in RPMC, when spirulina (10 microg\/mL) was added, transiently and significantly increased about 70-fold at 10 sec compared with that of control cells. Moreover, spirulina (10 microg\/mL) had a significant inhibitory effect on anti-DNP IgE-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production. These results indicate that spirulina inhibits mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions in vivo and in vitro.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["H M Kim","E H Lee","H H Cho","Y H Moon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-05T17:37:37+00:00","issns":["0006-2952"],"issue":"7","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1425576938,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9605430"],"pmid":"9605430","pubdate":"1998-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibitory effect of mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic reactions in rats by spirulina.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effect-mast-cellmediated-immediatetype-allergic-reactions-rats-spirulina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836649,"mean":5.7711936349331,"rank":4048044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144380,"mean":10.153599069117,"rank":119969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144380,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1235,"mean":5.1900518638574,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1235,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.5076470588235,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":1,"Biological Sciences":7,"Chemistry":3,"Arts and Literature":1,"Management Science \/ Operations Research":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Inhibitory effect of mast cell-mediated immediate-type allergic rea... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1562156450666074\/posts\/1600571016824617","license":"public","citation_ids":[3758368],"posted_on":"2015-03-05T17:35:38+00:00","summary":"Spirulina is one of the ingredients in Immunothrive.
