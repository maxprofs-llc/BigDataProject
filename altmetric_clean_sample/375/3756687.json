Recent studies on future remembering have led to suggestions that prospective cognition might be based on past experience. To test this hypothesis, we focused on retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF), which usually indicates that remembering past events suppresses memory for related but different past events. The current study assessed RIF in two kinds of event-based prospective memory (PM) tasks using either focal or non-focal cues for ongoing tasks. Participants studied six members from each of eight taxonomic categories and then practiced recalling three of the six members from four of the eight categories using category-stem cues. This retrieval practice suppressed the detection of non-practiced members of the practiced categories during the PM task with non-focal cues (Experiment 1) but not with focal cues (Experiment 2). The results suggest that recall of certain items inhibits the function of the others as PM cues, but only if the PM task does not largely share its processing with the ongoing task.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f610001334","authors":["Kenta Utsumi","Utsumi K","Saito S"],"doi":"10.1080\/09658211.2015.1015573","endpage":"443","first_seen_on":"2015-03-05T07:56:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0965-8211","1464-0686"],"issue":"4","journal":"Memory","last_mentioned_on":1474275928,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09658211.2015.1015573","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09658211.2015.1015573","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/09658211.2015.1015573"],"pmid":"25730102","pubdate":"2015-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"437","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"When remembering the past suppresses memory for future actions","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/remembering-past-suppresses-memory-future-actions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":3991420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4226043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204444,"mean":9.3582402038711,"rank":90783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":106918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204444,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":579,"mean":8.7729584775087,"rank":333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":579,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":8.0284827586207,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
