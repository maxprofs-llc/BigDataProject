To determine the impact of genetic variation on the susceptibility to the disorder and its response to treatment, studies have been conducted to assess the contribution of a variety of candidate genetic variants. These variants, which we review here, were chosen based upon their observed or hypothesized functional relevance to alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk or to the mechanism by which medications used to treat the disorder exert their effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021cc","authors":["Jones, Jermaine D.","Comer, Sandra D.","Kranzler, Henry R."],"doi":"10.1111\/acer.12643","endpage":"402","first_seen_on":"2015-03-04T10:52:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0277","0145-6008"],"issue":"3","journal":"Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research","last_mentioned_on":1429288233,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12643\/abstract;jsessionid=3FEE8509C9CB4724A74B48C449F7C5BC.f01t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7th+March+from+10%3A00-13%3A00+GMT+%2805%3A00-08%3A00+EST%29+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12643\/abstract;jsessionid=7A02477243518B218C2F1EF563A866D9.f01t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+7th+March+from+10%3A00-13%3A00+GMT+%2805%3A00-08%3A00+EST%29+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12643\/abstract;jsessionid=A11DC51B583AF9C40FFDB17F39DA8C1D.f02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12643\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/acer.12643\/pdf","pmid":"25703505","pubdate":"2015-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"391","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"The Pharmacogenetics of Alcohol Use Disorder","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacogenetics-alcohol-disorder-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6363217,"mean":5.9834796354552,"rank":2262543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4060280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6363217,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168265,"mean":9.7507181096373,"rank":63264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":103119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168265,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1264,"mean":12.143545526524,"rank":751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1264,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":19.954409090909,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
