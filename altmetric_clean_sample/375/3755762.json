In the equatorial plane, it is coordinated by two carboxyl-ate O atoms of two symmetry-related monodentate formyl-benzoate anions and by two N atoms of two bridging pyrazine ligands. The latter are bis-ected by the twofold rotation axis. The axial positions are occupied by two O atoms of the coordinating water mol-ecules. In the formyl-benzoate anion, the carboxyl-ate group is twisted away from the attached benzene ring by 7.50\u2005(8)\u00b0, while the benzene and pyrazine rings are oriented at a dihedral angle of 64.90\u2005(4)\u00b0. The pyrazine ligands bridge the Co(II) cations, forming linear chains running along the b-axis direction. Strong intra-molecular O-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds link the water mol-ecules to the carboxyl-ate O atoms. In the crystal, weak O-Hwater\u22efOwater hydrogen bonds link adjacent chains into layers parallel to the bc plane. The layers are linked via C-Hpyrazine\u22efOform-yl hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional network. There are also weak C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions present.","authors":["Askin, G.
