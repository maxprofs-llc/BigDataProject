Amongst the vanilloid-type TRP channels (which includes the six members of the TRPV family), target diseases include cough, asthma, cancer, and more recently, pulmonary edema associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here, we critically evaluate a recent report that addresses TRPV4 as a candidate target for the management of acute lung injury that develops as a consequence of aspiration of gastric contents, or acute chlorine gas exposure. By use of two new TRPV4 inhibitors (GSK2220691 or GSK2337429A) and a trpv4(-\/-) mouse strain, TRPV4 was implicated as a key mediator of pulmonary inflammation after direct chemical insult. Additionally, applied therapeutically, TRPV4 inhibitors exhibited vasculoprotective effects after chlorine gas exposure, inhibiting vascular leakage, and improving blood oxygenation. These observations underscore TRPV4 channels as candidate therapeutic targets in the management of lung injury, with the added need to balance these against the potential drawbacks of TRPV4 inhibition, such as the danger of limiting the immune response in settings of pathogen-provoked injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002211","authors":["Morty RE","Kuebler WM"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajplung.00254.2014","first_seen_on":"2015-03-04T12:03:52+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Lung Cellular & Molecular Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1425470615,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25281637?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25281637","pubdate":"2014-10-05T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","physiology","cellbiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"TRPV4: an exciting new target to promote alveolo-capillary barrier function.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trpv4-exciting-new-target-promote-alveolocapillary-barrier-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4833230,"mean":5.76720096441,"rank":4045901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4833230,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144107,"mean":10.115023565986,"rank":119609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144107,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":2.6662055214724,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.2335483870968,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
