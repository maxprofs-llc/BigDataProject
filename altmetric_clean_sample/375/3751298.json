It is argued that muscle spindles are not well suited as position sensors, on several grounds. Yet we know from muscle vibration experiments that they do contribute to kinesthesia. A number of recent experiments have shown that positional information is of particular significance to the central nervous system. In other experiments it has been demonstrated that a disturbance to kinesthesia follows fatigue from exercise. Fatigue of elbow flexor muscles led subjects to make significant positional errors in a forearm matching task. The size of the errors correlated with the fall in force from fatigue. These data suggest that we derive a positional cue from the effort required to hold a limb against the force of gravity. A challenge for the future will be to reveal how the centrally derived sense of effort and peripherally derived afferent information interact to give us our kinesthetic sense.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008208","authors":["Proske, Uwe","Uwe Proske"],"doi":"10.1002\/mus.20330","endpage":"787","first_seen_on":"2015-03-03T21:01:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4598","0148-639X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Muscle & Nerve","last_mentioned_on":1501021657,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.20330\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mus.20330"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mus.20330\/pdf","pmid":"15818635","pubdate":"2005-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"780","subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"What is the role of muscle receptors in proprioception?","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-muscle-receptors-proprioception"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.3,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272105,"mean":6.9807941447478,"rank":1768324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6499565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272105,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202472,"mean":9.3197708906462,"rank":51568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":150740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202472,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1390,"mean":3.8096083513319,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1390,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":4.2221777777778,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Ph.
