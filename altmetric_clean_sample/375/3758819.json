Metreleptin was approved in the US for generalized lipodystrophy (GLD), but not partial lipodystrophy (PLD). Objective: To test metreleptin's efficacy in PLD versus GLD and find predictors for treatment response. Design: Prospective, single-arm, open-label study since 2000 with continuous enrollment. Current analysis included metreleptin treatment for \u22656 months as of January, 2014. Setting: National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Participants: Patients clinically diagnosed with lipodystrophy, leptin <8 ng\/mL (males) or <12 (females), age >6 months, and \u22651metabolic abnormality (diabetes, insulin resistance, or hypertriglyceridemia). Intervention: Subcutaneous metreleptin injections (0.06-0.24 mg\/kg\/day). Main outcomes and measures: Change in A1c and triglycerides after 6 and 12 months of metreleptin. Results: Baseline metabolic parameters were similar in 55 GLD (A1c, 8.4\u00b12.3%; triglycerides, geometric mean [25th, 75th percentile], 467 mg\/dL [200, 847]) and 31 PLD patients (A1c 8.1\u00b12.2%, triglycerides 483 mg\/dL [232, 856]) despite different body fat and endogenous leptin. At 12 months, metreleptin decreased A1c (to 6.4\u00b11.5%, GLD, p<0.001; 7.3\u00b11.6%, PLD, p=0.004) and triglycerides (to180 mg\/dL [106, 312], GLD, p<0.001; 326 mg\/dL [175, 478], PLD, p=0.02). A1c and triglyceride changes over time significantly differed between GLD and PLD. In subgroup analysis metreleptin improved A1c and triglycerides in all GLD subgroups except those with baseline triglycerides <300 mg\/dL, and all PLD subgroups except baseline triglycerides <500 mg\/dL, A1c <8% or endogenous leptin >4 ng\/mL. Conclusions: In addition to its proven efficacy in GLD, metreleptin is effective in selected PLD patients with severe metabolic derangements or low leptin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Talia Diker-Cohen","Elaine Cochran","Phillip Gorden","Rebecca J Brown"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2014-4491","first_seen_on":"2015-03-05T20:06:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1425589546,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25734254\/"],"pmid":"25734254","pubdate":"2015-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Partial and Generalized Lipodystrophy: Comparison of Baseline Characteristics and Response to Metreleptin.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/partial-generalized-lipodystrophy-comparison-baseline-characteristics-response-metreleptin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836649,"mean":5.7711936349331,"rank":2205445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2629989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836649,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144368,"mean":10.153082879051,"rank":66839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":77509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144368,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5158,"mean":6.0123343028893,"rank":2716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5158,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":22.131417475728,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
