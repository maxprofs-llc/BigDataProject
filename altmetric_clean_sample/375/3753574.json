To elucidate the mechanisms of such protection, this study assessed the effects of thalidomide on the oxidative stress and inflammatory response induced by ischemia\/reperfusion episodes in rats. Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2hours. All animals were sacrificed after different reperfusion times. Rats were administered either DMSO or thalidomide (20mg\/kg (i.p.)) at different times before or during reperfusion: 1) 1h before reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 2h after reperfusion. 2) 10min before reperfusion and 80min after reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 24h after reperfusion; and 3) 10min before reperfusion and 1h, 24h, 48h, and 68h after reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 72h after reperfusion. Thalidomide reduced the infarct area 24h and 72h after MCAO, and decreased the neurological deficit in all groups with respect to controls. Thalidomide also lowered significantly the number of TUNEL-positive cells, levels of Bax, caspase-3, lipoperoxidation, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased the levels of SOD1, Bcl-2 and pAkt. These results show that thalidomide has neuroprotective effects, apparently due to its anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Palencia, Guadalupe","Medrano, Juan \u00c1ngel N\u00fa\u00f1ez-","Ortiz-Plata, Alma","Farf\u00e1n, Dolores Jim\u00e9nez","Sotelo, Julio","S\u00e1nchez, Aurora","Trejo-Sol\u00eds, Cristina"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jns.2015.02.043","first_seen_on":"2015-03-04T12:27:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-510X","1878-5883"],"journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1425556252,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jns-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-510X%252815%252900123-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=jns-site","http:\/\/www.jns-journal.com\/article\/S0022-510X(15)00123-9\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jns-journal.com\/article\/S0022510X15001239\/pdf","pmid":"25818676","pubdate":"2015-03-31T22:04:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of thalidomide on cerebral ischemia\/reperfusion injury in rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiapoptotic-antioxidant-antiinflammatory-effects-thalidomide-cerebral-ischemiareperfusion-injury-r-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836649,"mean":5.7711936349331,"rank":2399484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2291439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836649,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144277,"mean":10.128166860739,"rank":73669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":64014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144277,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1367,"mean":2.8545812591508,"rank":644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1367,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.9239672131148,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
