Recently, the ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyl transferase (egt) gene from the baculovirus Lymantria\u00a0dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) was identified to induce tree-top disease in L.\u00a0dispar larvae. Infected gypsy moth larvae died at elevated positions (hence the term tree-top disease), which is thought to promote dissemination of the virus to lower foliage. It is, however, unknown whether egt has a conserved role among baculoviruses in inducing tree-top disease. Here, we studied tree-top disease induced by the baculovirus Autographa\u00a0californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) in two different host insects, Trichoplusia\u00a0ni and Spodoptera\u00a0exigua, and we investigated the role of the viral egt gene therein. AcMNPV induced tree-top disease in both T.\u00a0ni and S.\u00a0exigua larvae, although in S.\u00a0exigua a moulting-dependent effect was seen. Those S.\u00a0exigua larvae undergoing a larval moult during the infection process died at elevated positions, while larvae that did not moult after infection died at low positions. For both T.\u00a0ni and S.\u00a0exigua, infection with a mutant AcMNPV lacking egt did not change the position where the larvae died. We conclude that egt has no highly conserved role in inducing tree-top disease in lepidopteran larvae. The conclusion that egt is a 'gene for an extended phenotype' is therefore not generally applicable for all baculovirus-host interactions. We hypothesize that in some baculovirus-host systems (including LdMNPV in L.\u00a0dispar), an effect of egt on tree-top disease can be observed through indirect effects of egt on moulting-related climbing behaviour.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037bc","authors":["Ros VI","van Houte S","Hemerik L","van Oers MM"],"doi":"10.1111\/mec.13019","first_seen_on":"2015-03-05T11:59:12+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Ecology","last_mentioned_on":1425556714,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25443568?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25443568","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Baculovirus-induced tree-top disease: how extended is the role of egt as a gene for the extended phenotype?","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/baculovirusinduced-treetop-disease-extended-role-egt-gene-extended-phenotype"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4836649,"mean":5.7711936349331,"rank":2567381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1613648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4836649,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144380,"mean":10.153602878535,"rank":81355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144380,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2496,"mean":6.6459142284569,"rank":1956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2496,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":13.109454545455,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
