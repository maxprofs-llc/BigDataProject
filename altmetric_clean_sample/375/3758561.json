Short chain enoyl coenzyme\u00a0A hydratase\u00a01\u00a0(ECHS1) is an important gene involved in the mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2\u2011oxidation pathway. In addition, ECHS1 has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, colon and liver cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of ECHS1 in the human HCT\u20118 colorectal cancer cell line. The results showed that ECHS1 expression was significantly increased in poorly\u2011differentiated cells compared with that in well\u2011differentiated cells. In order to further investigate the functions of ECHS1 in colorectal cancer cells, a stably transfected HCT\u20118 cell line expressing small interfering\u00a0(si)RNA targeting the ECHS1 gene was established. The expression of the ECHS1 siRNA was found to reduce ECHS1 protein levels in ECHS1\u2011silenced cells by >40%. Cell proliferation and cell migration of the siECHS1 cells were characterized using Cell Counting Kit\u20118 and Transwell assays, respectively, the results of which showed that the constitutive knockdown of the ECSH1 gene in HCT\u20118 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, decreased levels of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3\u03b2 phosphorylation were observed in ECHS1\u2011silenced HCT\u20118 cells compared with that of parental or pU6 empty vector\u2011transfected cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that ECHS1 may have an important role in colorectal cancer cell proliferation and migration via activation of Akt\u2011 and GSK3\u03b2\u2011associated signaling pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Qing-Mei Zhao","Fei Kuang","Han Wu","Yu-Hao Zhang"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.3418","first_seen_on":"2015-03-05T18:44:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1452601850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25739098?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25739098?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25739098","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Attenuation of enoyl coenzyme\u00a0A hydratase\u00a01 expression in colorectal cancer cells using small interfering\u00a0RNA inhibits cell proliferation and migration.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6945952,"mean":6.2265228839048,"rank":5956299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6945952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196733,"mean":8.9931476424782,"rank":161759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196733,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1695,"mean":1.4264710743802,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1695,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":0.80757251908397,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/686888060693254144","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3758561],"posted_on":"2016-01-12T12:30:50+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"686888060693254144"}]}}
