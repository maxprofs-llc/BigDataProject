Once synthesized in the cytoplasm by the C\u03b2G synthase (Cgs), C\u03b2G are transported to the periplasm by the C\u03b2G transporter (Cgt) and succinylated by the C\u03b2G modifier enzyme (Cgm). Here, we used a bacterial two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to study the interaction network between these three integral inner membrane proteins. Our results indicate that Cgs, Cgt and Cgm can form both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Analyses carried out with Cgs mutants revealed that the N-terminal region of the protein (Cgs-region 1 to 418) is required to sustain the interactions with Cgt and Cgm as well as with itself. We demonstrate by single-cell fluorescence analysis that in Brucella Cgs and Cgt are focally distributed in the membrane, particularly at the cell poles, whereas Cgm is mostly distributed throughout the membrane with a slight accumulation at the poles colocalizing with the other partners. In summary, our results demonstrate that Cgs, Cgt and Cgm form a membrane-associated biosynthetic complex. We propose that the formation of a membrane complex could serve as a mechanism to ensure the fidelity of C\u03b2G biosynthesis by coordinating their synthesis with the transport and modification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Leticia S Guidolin","Susana Morrone","Francisco F Guaimas","Diego J Comerci","Andr\u00e9s E Ciocchini"],"doi":"10.1128\/jb.00068-15","first_seen_on":"2015-03-04T11:25:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5530"],"journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1425468292,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25733613?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25733613","pubdate":"2015-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Interaction network and localization of Brucella abortus membrane proteins involved in the synthesis, transport and succinylation of cyclic \u03b2-1,2-glucans.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-network-localization-brucella-abortus-membrane-proteins-involved-synthesis-transport-suc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4833580,"mean":5.7669729527574,"rank":4046032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4833580,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144116,"mean":10.120429337682,"rank":119610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144116,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3465,"mean":3.0061830254042,"rank":3113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3465,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.9709302325581,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
