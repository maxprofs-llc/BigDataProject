This highlights the difficulties faced by those trying to ensure safe and effective prescribing for neonates. Urgent action is required to resolve this situation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002304","authors":["Sharon Conroy","John McIntyre","Imti Choonara"],"doi":"10.1136\/fn.80.2.f142","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T17:20:59+00:00","issns":["1359-2998","1468-2052"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood -- Fetal & Neonatal Edition","last_mentioned_on":1490376140,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/fn.80.2.F142"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/content\/fetalneonatal\/80\/2\/F142.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1720896","pmid":"10325794","pubdate":"1999-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Unlicensed and off label drug use in neonates \u00a0 Commentary","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/fn.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/fn.80.2.F142","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unlicensed-label-drug-neonates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2159295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5101371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248176,"mean":13.334983604311,"rank":86387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":158504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248176,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":948,"mean":5.687419218585,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":948,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":6.0774193548387,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
