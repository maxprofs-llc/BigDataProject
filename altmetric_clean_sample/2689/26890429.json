In this article, the authors review relevant literature, and describe their study that identified how nurses and physicians define respectful behavior; examined perceptions of the relationship between nurses and physicians in clinical settings in which they practice together; and analyzed the impact of nurse-physician relationships on nursing care decisions. Perceptions of nurse-physician relationships were assessed using the Professional Practice Environment Assessment Scale and perceptions of respectful behavior and the effect of physician behavior on nursing practice were assessed with single, forced-choice items. The authors report finding that physicians rated relationships significantly better than did nurses. Additionally, they note that 55% of nurses said that a physician's behavior impacted nursing decisions, and that younger, less experienced nurses were more likely to report being affected by negative physician behaviors than older nurses or nurses with more experience. They discuss how nurses' and physicians' different perceptions of the same environment is not surprising, but is instructive, and conclude that acknowledging differences in values, incentives, and perceptions can provide insights that focus improvement initiatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003246","authors":["Siedlecki, Sandra L","Hixson, Eric D"],"first_seen_on":"2017-10-01T23:39:53+00:00","issns":["1091-3734"],"issue":"2","journal":"Online Journal of Issues in Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1506901181,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26882515\/?i=3&from=relationships%20between%20nurses%20and%20physicians%20matter"],"pmid":"26882515","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Relationships Between Nurses and Physicians Matter.","type":"article","volume":"20"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":7311987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107250,"mean":11.23886128542,"rank":86943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107250,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.0344615384615,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrRPalmquist\/statuses\/914635962755321856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26890429],"posted_on":"2017-10-01T23:39:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Richard Palmquist","url":"http:\/\/www.LovAPet.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/536479953593073666\/9u7NKAMD_normal.jpeg","description":"Centinela Animal Hospital, Inc.
