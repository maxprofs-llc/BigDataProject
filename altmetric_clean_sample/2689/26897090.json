The purpose of this study<\/p> <p>was to determine the safety of GL-ONC1 when delivered intravenously with chemoradiotherapy<\/p> <p>to patients with primary, non-metastatic head and neck cancer.<\/p> <p>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with locoregionally advanced unresected, non-metastatic<\/p> <p>carcinoma of the head\/neck, excluding stage III-IVA p16-positive oropharyngeal cancers, were<\/p> <p>treated with escalating doses and cycles of intravenous GL-ONC1, along with radiotherapy and<\/p> <p>chemotherapy. The primary aims were to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and doselimiting<\/p> <p>toxicities, and to recommend a dose for phase II trials.<\/p> <p>RESULTS: Between May 2012 and December 2014, 19 patients were enrolled. The most<\/p> <p>frequent adverse reactions included grade 1-2 rigors, fever, fatigue, and rash. Grade 3 adverse<\/p> <p>reactions included hypotension, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting. In 2 patients, the rash was<\/p> <p>confirmed as viral in origin by fluorescence imaging and viral plaque assay. In 4 patients, viral<\/p> <p>presence in tumor was confirmed on mid-treatment biopsy by quantitative polymerase chain<\/p> <p>reaction. In 1 patient, live virus was confirmed in a tongue tumor 7 days after receiving first dose<\/p> <p>of virus. The MTD was not reached. With median follow-up of 30 months, 1 year (2 year)<\/p> <p>progression-free survival and overall survival were 74.4% (64.1%) and 84.6% (69.2%)<\/p> <p>respectively.<\/p> <p>CONCLUSION: Delivery of GL-ONC1 is safe and feasible in patients with locoregionally<\/p> <p>advanced head\/neck cancer undergoing standard chemoradiotherapy. A phase II study is<\/p> <p>warranted to further investigate this novel treatment strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Loren K. Mell","Kevin T. Brumund","Gregory A.
