We assessed the incidence of serous endometrial carcinoma in an independent prospective cohort study of 369 BRCA1\/2 women (1779 woman-years of follow-up) who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy by laparoscopy. This occurrence in two BRCA1 carriers led us to estimate that BRCA1\/2 carriers present a higher risk than the control population (standardized incidence ratio = 32.2, 95% confidence interval = 11.5 to 116.4, P < .001, two-sided chi-square test, 1 degree of freedom). In addition, in both tumors, the wild-type BRCA1 allele was lost, indicating the inactivation of the BRCA1 gene and arguing for a link with endometrial carcinogenesis. Prophylactic hysterectomy could be discussed with informed women through a shared decision-making process although the estimated 3% life-long risk is moderate. Additional studies are required to establish future prophylactic surgery guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c44","authors":["Claire Saule","Emmanuelle Mouret-Fourme","Adrien Briaux","V\u00e9ronique Becette","Roman Rouzier","Claude Houdayer","Dominique Stoppa-Lyonnet","Saule, Claire","Mouret-Fourme, Emmanuelle","Briaux, Adrien","Becette, V\u00e9ronique","Rouzier, Roman","Houdayer, Claude","Stoppa-Lyonnet, Dominique"],"doi":"10.1093\/jnci\/djx159","first_seen_on":"2017-10-02T02:12:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0027-8874","1460-2105"],"issue":"2","journal":"JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute","last_mentioned_on":1506955715,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28954295\/?i=6&from=brca1","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jnci\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/jnci\/djx159"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jnci\/article-pdf\/110\/2\/djx159\/19547620\/djx159.pdf","pmid":"28954295","pubdate":"2018-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Risk of Serous Endometrial Carcinoma in Women With Pathogenic BRCA1\/2 Variant After Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy","type":"article","volume":"110"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":2.1,"1w":2.1,"6d":2.1,"5d":2.1,"4d":2.1,"3d":2.1,"2d":2.1,"1d":2.1,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8459670,"mean":7.106169576603,"rank":3642926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4779291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8459670,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103152,"mean":11.165453752266,"rank":37762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":64467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103152,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4534,"mean":13.933790425767,"rank":3072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4534,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":39.957939393939,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LguzzardiM\/statuses\/914674247460687872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26893402],"posted_on":"2017-10-02T02:11:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Lisa M Guzzardi, RN","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/420494918068983\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643272867124264960\/10aQ8fO0_normal.jpg","description":"#HBOC #PatientAdvocate dedicated to providing up to date evidence based research for 2.7 K 'SoMe' consumers @ risk & clinicians #JournalClub #bcsm #gyncsm #BRCA","id_on_source":"LguzzardiM","tweeter_id":"2432381543","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5619},"tweet_id":"914674247460687872"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Pforsure\/statuses\/914675596483076097","license":"gnip","rt":["LguzzardiM"],"citation_ids":[26893402],"posted_on":"2017-10-02T02:17:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Patricia Gambol","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/588015614020739072\/kgzoq_YR_normal.jpg","description":"Republican-leans toward Libertarian.
