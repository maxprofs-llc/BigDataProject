CYP2E1 is recognized as the enzyme that initiates the cascade of events leading to acetaminophen (APAP)-induced toxicity. However, no studies have characterized its role in APAP-induced hepatic injury. Here, we investigated the protective effects of AC on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity via mitochondrial dysfunction. AC (5-500\u03bcg\/mL) significantly inhibited APAP-induced reduction of glutathione. In addition, AC decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein levels (% change 46.63) in mitochondria. Moreover, it increased Bcl-2 (% change 55.39) and cytochrome C levels (% change 38.33) in mitochondria, measured using immunofluorescence or a commercial kit. Furthermore, cell membrane integrity was preserved and nuclear fragmentation inhibited by AC. These results demonstrate that AC protects hepatocytes against APAP-induced toxicity by inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Gunhyuk Park","Ki Mo Kim","Songie Choi","Dal-Seok Oh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2016.01.012","first_seen_on":"2017-05-28T14:41:09+00:00","issns":["13826689"],"journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1495982455,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26895385"],"pmid":"26895385","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Aconitum carmichaelii protects against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity via B-cell lymphoma-2 protein-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aconitum-carmichaelii-protects-against-acetaminopheninduced-hepatotoxicity-via-bcell-lymphoma2-prote"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":7162728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239327,"mean":12.092285535211,"rank":194423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":492,"mean":3.673967413442,"rank":376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":492,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.75,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"HU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrRPalmquist\/statuses\/868839507231100930","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20669400],"posted_on":"2017-05-28T14:40:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Richard Palmquist","url":"http:\/\/www.LovAPet.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/536479953593073666\/9u7NKAMD_normal.jpeg","description":"Centinela Animal Hospital, Inc.
