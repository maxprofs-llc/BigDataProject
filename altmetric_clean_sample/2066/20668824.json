The worldwide prevalence of obesity has increased in the last few recent decades, and consequently, the women of our time suffer more gestational problems than women in the past. The prevalence of obesity is greater in older women in older women than in younger ones, and in women with low educational level than in their counterparts with a higher level of education. Maternal obesity during pregnancy may increase congenital malformations and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal obesity is associated with a decreased intention to breastfeed, decreased initiation of breastfeeding, and decreased duration of breastfeeding. We discuss the current epidemiological evidence for the association of maternal obesity with congenital structural neural tube and cardiac defects, fetal macrosomia that predisposes infants to birth injuries and to problems with physiological and metabolic transition, as well as potential for long-term effects secondary to prenatal and neonatal programming effects compounded by a redurtion in sustained breastfeeding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003fa0","authors":["Levent Korkmaz","Osman Ba\u015ftu\u011f","Selim Kurto\u011flu"],"doi":"10.4274\/jcrpe.2127","first_seen_on":"2017-05-28T13:59:51+00:00","issns":["13085727"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1495979110,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5096465\/"],"pmid":"26758575","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Galenos Yayinevi","startpage":"114","subjects":["endocrinology","pediatrics"],"title":"Maternal Obesity and its Short- and Long-Term Maternal and Infantile Effects","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-obesity-shortand-longterm-maternal-infantile-effects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":4405985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2306086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239327,"mean":12.092297025814,"rank":131787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239327,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":3.9773267326733,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.9333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/knoxvillelaw2\/statuses\/868825479280832512","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20668824],"posted_on":"2017-05-28T13:45:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Butler, Vines & Babb","url":"http:\/\/www.butlervinesbabblaw.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/765903389762818048\/c1pkP_Fy_normal.jpg","description":"Founded in 1973, Butler, Vines and Babb is a Knoxville based law firm known for extraordinary client service.
