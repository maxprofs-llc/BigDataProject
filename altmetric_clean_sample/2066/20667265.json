Participating survivors invited a support person to also complete a survey. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the relationships among survivor and support person self-reported depression, anxiety, and unmet needs.\nOf the 4299 eligible haematological cancer survivors contacted by the registries, 1511 (35%) returned a completed survey as did 1004 support persons. There were 787 dyads with complete data. After adjusting for age, gender, rurality, cancer type, and whether the support person was a relative, positive correlations were found between survivor and support person scores for depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0029) and unmet needs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but not anxiety scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.075). Survivor unmet needs were significantly related to support person depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0036). Support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher depression score for survivors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0067). Greater support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher anxiety score for survivors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0083). Survivor unmet needs did not have a significant relationship to support person anxiety (p\u00a0=\u00a00.78).\nUnmet needs may mediate the interdependence of psychosocial experiences for survivors and support persons, although a longitudinal study is required to confirm causality. Addressing unmet needs may be a potential target for improving outcomes for both groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","authors":["Paul, Christine","Hall, Alix","Oldmeadow, Christopher","Lynagh, Marita","Campbell, Sharon","Bradstock, Ken","Williamson, Anna","Carey, Mariko","Sanson-Fisher, Rob","Christine Paul","Alix Hall","Christopher Oldmeadow","Marita Lynagh","Sharon Campbell","Ken Bradstock","Anna Williamson","Mariko Carey","Rob Sanson-Fisher"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00520-017-3751-3","first_seen_on":"2017-05-28T10:06:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0941-4355","1433-7339"],"journal":"Supportive Care in Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1506157159,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28550441?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s00520-017-3751-3","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00520-017-3751-3","https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00520-017-3751-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00520-017-3751-3.pdf","pmid":"28550441","pubdate":"2017-05-28T22:01:06+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","healthservices"],"title":"Dyadic interdependence of psychosocial outcomes among haematological cancer survivors and their support persons","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dyadic-interdependence-psychosocial-outcomes-among-haematological-cancer-survivors-support-persons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":3896969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4472150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246941,"mean":12.625648513809,"rank":109510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":133337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246941,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1822,"mean":4.6937649643053,"rank":956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1822,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.9398484848485,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
