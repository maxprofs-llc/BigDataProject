Darwin's finches of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are under attack by introduced pox virus (Poxvirus avium) and nest flies (Philornis downsi). We developed assays for parasite-specific antibody responses in Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis), to test for relationships between adaptive immune responses to novel parasites and spatial-temporal variation in the occurrence of parasite pressure among G. fortis populations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...5.8605H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sarah K.
