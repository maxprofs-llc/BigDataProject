Many neurons are generated through post-embryonic neurogenesis to have adult-specific roles, but perhaps more striking is the dramatic remodeling that occurs to transition neurons from functioning in the larval to the adult nervous system. These neurons exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity during this transition; many subsets undergo programmed cell death, others remodel their axonal and dendritic arbors extensively, whereas others undergo trans-differentiation to alter their terminal differentiation gene expression profiles. Yet other neurons appear to be developmentally frozen in an immature state throughout larval life, to be awakened at metamorphosis by a process we term temporally-tuned differentiation. These multiple forms of remodeling arise from subtype-specific responses to a single metamorphic trigger, ecdysone. Here, we discuss recent progress in Drosophila melanogaster that is shedding light on how subtype-specific programs of neuronal remodeling are generated during metamorphosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007444","first_seen_on":"2013-04-13T10:36:00+00:00","issns":["1933-6942"],"issue":"2","journal":"Fly","last_mentioned_on":1365849304,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23579264?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23579264","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Subtype-specific neuronal remodeling during Drosophila metamorphosis.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subtypespecific-neuronal-remodeling-during-drosophila-metamorphosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":2898879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85503,"mean":6.4934898131039,"rank":65989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85503,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":1.0312307692308,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.43571428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
