All three stereocenters were created with the aid of asymmetric Brown allylations. The lactone ring was built by means of a ring-closing metathesis (RCM). The synthetic and the natural compound differed in their spectral properties. A new structure is now proposed for stagonolide G and demonstrated by means of a chemical transformation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["C\u00e9sar A.
