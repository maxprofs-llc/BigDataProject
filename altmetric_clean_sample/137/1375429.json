As ultraviolet (UV) light is required for vitamin D synthesis, low UV light availability is thought to increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and poor bone health. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if individuals with low UV intensity at their home of record (HOR) or those with darker complexions are at increased risk of developing stress fractures and lower limb fractures during U.S. Army Basic Combat Training (BCT).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-14-135","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T16:24:56+00:00","issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1365783842,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/14\/135\/abstract"],"pmid":"23587313","pubdate":"2013-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"A retrospective cohort study on the influence of UV index and race\/ethnicity on risk of stress and lower limb fractures","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-cohort-study-influence-uv-index-raceethnicity-risk-stress-lower-limb-fractures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3095114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89135,"mean":6.7230030740235,"rank":60609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":19277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89135,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1534,"mean":3.7308140900196,"rank":1156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1534,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":4.2316144578313,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
