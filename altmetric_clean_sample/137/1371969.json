To address these concerns, the American Cancer Society (ACS) convened a group of experts in nutrition, physical activity, and cancer to evaluate the scientific evidence and best clinical practices related to optimal nutrition and physical activity after the diagnosis of cancer. This report summarizes their findings and is intended to present health care providers with the best possible information from which to help cancer survivors and their families make informed choices related to nutrition and physical activity. The report discusses nutrition and physical activity issues during the phases of cancer treatment and recovery, living after recovery from treatment, and living with advanced cancer; select nutrition and physical activity issues such as body weight, food choices, and food safety; issues related to select cancer sites; and common questions about diet, physical activity, and cancer survivorship.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6f63cf058f61000a1b0","authors":["Doyle C","Kushi LH","Byers T","Courneya KS","Demark-Wahnefried W","Grant B","McTiernan A","Rock CL","Thompson C","Gansler T","Andrews KS"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T06:46:18+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians ","last_mentioned_on":1295232660,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17135691"],"pmid":"17135691","pubdate":"2005-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Nutrition and physical activity during and after cancer treatment: an American Cancer Society guide for informed choices.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutrition-physical-activity-during-after-cancer-treatment-american-cancer-society-guide-informed-cho-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.056,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.056},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9372923047901,"rank":597115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3087366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85546,"mean":6.4516033432696,"rank":15872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85546,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":402,"mean":14.198498753117,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":402,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
