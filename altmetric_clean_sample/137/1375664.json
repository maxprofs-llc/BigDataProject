In optics, multiphoton entangled states, known as NOON states, can be used to obtain high-precision phase measurements, becoming more and more advantageous as the number of photons grows. We generated \"high-NOON\" states (N = 5) by multiphoton interference of quantum down-converted light with a classical coherent state in an approach that is inherently scalable. Super-resolving phase measurements with up to five entangled photons were produced with a visibility higher than that obtainable using classical light only.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010Sci...328..879A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Itai Afek","Oron Ambar","Yaron Silberberg","Afek I","Ambar O","Silberberg Y","I.
