Academic research has recently engaged with identifying these salient resources, but has left the question why they are helpful to former child soldiers largely unaddressed. This study therefore focuses on the meaning underlying certain phenomena that causes them to become resources. Semistructured in-depth interviews and a free-listing task on resources were conducted with 48 northern Ugandan former child soldiers. The phenomenological hermeneutical method is applied to analyze their lived experiences and the meaning they assign to resources. Four essential themes emerge from this study, representing the fourfold meaning of resources for former child soldiers in helping them (a) to break with their former existence as child soldiers, (b) to be able to overcome the challenges in their current life, (c) to belong to others and the environment to which they have returned, and (d) to become the person they aspire to be. Considering these research themes in the context of former child soldiers' return process, parallels with theories on transition are recognized and further explored so as to contextualize this emerging meaning. As such, this research delivers empirical evidence illustrating how resources help to pilot former child soldiers through transition in the wake of child soldiering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Sofie Vindevogel","Eric Broekaert","Ilse Derluyn","Vindevogel S","Broekaert E","Derluyn I"],"doi":"10.1177\/0886260513479031","endpage":"2436","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T19:03:59+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3218344","handles":["1854\/LU-3218344"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-6518","0886-2605"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Interpersonal Violence","last_mentioned_on":1486658088,"links":["http:\/\/jiv.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/01\/0886260513479031.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0886260513479031","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0886260513479031"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jiv.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/04\/01\/0886260513479031.full.pdf","pmid":"23549226","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage CA: Los Angeles, CA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2413","subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"\u201cIt Helps Me Transform in My Life From the Past to the New\u201d: The Meaning of Resources for Former Child Soldiers","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/it-helps-me-transform-life-past-new-meaning-resources-former-child-soldiers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":1920483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6225782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119336,"mean":6.7894753090042,"rank":28827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":89748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119336,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":5.0270179836512,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.2133333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
