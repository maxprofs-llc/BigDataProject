Cl-BODIPYs are exploited as synthetic intermediates generated in situ for the overall conversion of F-BODIPYs to O- and C-BODIPYs in high overall yields using a mild one-pot procedure. This route enables F-BODIPYs to be transformed into derivatives that are not accessible via the direct route, as demonstrated via the use of 1,3-propanediol.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Travis Lundrigan"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo302277d","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T04:53:21+00:00","issns":["0022-3263"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1357699380,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo302277d"],"pmid":"23237433","pubdate":"2012-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Conversion of F-BODIPYs to Cl-BODIPYs: Enhancing the Reactivity of F-BODIPYs.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conversion-f-bodipys-cl-bodipys-enhancing-reactivity-f-bodipys"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85292,"mean":6.47133495914,"rank":65790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85292,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2673,"mean":3.0409356287425,"rank":1976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2673,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.2983333333333,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":6}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Conversion of F-BODIPYs to Cl-BODIPYs: Enhancing the Reactivity of F-BODIPYs - The Journal of Organi","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=377192129042876&id=112800458880238","license":"public","citation_ids":[1370298],"posted_on":"2013-01-09T02:43:00+00:00","summary":"Lundrigan, T.; Thompson, A.
