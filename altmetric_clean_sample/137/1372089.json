Here we address this issue using an ndc80 mutant (ndc80-NH12) from fission yeast that contains a point mutation within a ubiquitous internal loop. This mutant is normal for assembly of the Ndc80 complex and bipolar spindle formation yet defective in proper end-on attachment to the spindle microtubule, with chromosome alignment defects and missegregation happening later during mitosis. We find that ndc80-NH12 exhibits impaired localization of the microtubule-associated protein complex Alp7\/transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC)-Alp14\/tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) to the mitotic kinetochore. Consistently, wild-type Ndc80 binds these two proteins, whereas the Ndc80-NH12 mutant protein displays a substantial reduction of interaction. Crucially, forced targeting of Alp7-Alp14 to the outer kinetochore rescues ndc80-NH12-mutant phenotypes. The loop was previously shown to bind Dis1\/TOG, by which it ensures initial chromosome capture during early mitosis. Strikingly, ndc80-NH12 is normal in Dis1 localization. Genetic results indicate that the loop recruits Dis1\/TOG and Alp7\/TACC-Alp14\/TOG independently. Our work therefore establishes that the Ndc80 loop plays sequential roles in spindle-kinetochore attachment by connecting the Ndc80 complex to Dis1\/TOG and Alp7\/TACC-Alp14\/TOG.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Ngang Heok Tang","Hirofumi Takada","Kuo-Shun Hsu","Takashi Toda"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e12-11-0817","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T07:26:02+00:00","funders":["cruk"],"issns":["1939-4586"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1365750808,"links":["http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/24\/8\/1122.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/24\/8\/1122.full.pdf","pmid":"23427262","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"The internal loop of fission yeast Ndc80 binds Alp7\/TACC-Alp14\/TOG and ensures proper chromosome attachment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internal-loop-fission-yeast-ndc80-binds-alp7taccalp14tog-ensures-proper-chromosome-attachment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3077025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89137,"mean":6.7382879644589,"rank":60191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89137,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2116,"mean":2.5709323877069,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2116,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.4026666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
