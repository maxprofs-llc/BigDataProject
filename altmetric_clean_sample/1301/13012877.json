Blood sampling for morphine assay was performed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min. Morphine serum concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using nonlinear mixed effects models. Current data were pooled with published time-concentration profiles from children (n = 1059, age 23 weeks postmenstrual age - 3 years) administered intravenous morphine, to determine oral bioavailability (F), absorption lag time (TLAG ), and absorption half-time (TABS ). These parameter estimates were used to predict concentrations in children given oral morphine (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mcg\u00b7kg(-1) ) at different dosing intervals (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 h).\nThe oral morphine formulation had F 0.298 (CV 36.5%), TLAG 0.45 (CV 63.6%) h and TABS 0.71 (CV 55%) h. A single-dose morphine 100 mcg\u00b7kg(-1) achieved a mean CMAX 10 mcg\u00b7l(-1) . Repeat 4-hourly dosing achieved mean steady-state concentration 13-18 mcg\u00b7l(-1) ; concentrations associated with good analgesia after intravenous administration. Serum concentration variability was large ranging from 5 to 55 mcg\u00b7l(-1) at steady state.\nOral morphine 200 mcg\u00b7kg(-1) then 100 mcg\u00b7kg(-1) 4 h or 150 mcg\u00b7kg(-1) 6 h achieves mean concentrations associated with analgesia. There was high serum concentration variability suggesting that respiration may be compromised in some children given these doses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000327f","authors":["Dawes, Joy M.","Cooke, Erin M.","Hannam, Jacqueline A.","Brand, Katherine A.","Winton, Pamela","Jimenez\u2010Mendez, Ricardo","Aleksa, Katarina","Lauder, Gillian R.","Carleton, Bruce C.","Koren, Gideon","Rieder, Michael J.","Anderson, Brian J.","Montgomery, Carolyne J.","Dawes, Joy M","Cooke, Erin M","Hannam, Jacqueline A","Brand, Katherine A","Jimenez-Mendez, Ricardo","Lauder, Gillian R","Carleton, Bruce C","Rieder, Michael J","Anderson, Brian J","Montgomery, Carolyne J","Joy M.
