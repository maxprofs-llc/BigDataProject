These lesions can be eventually associated with the PHACE syndrome. Our aim is to propose neonatal treatment with propranolol, showing its efficacy\/safety, given the scarce evidence on its neonatal use.\nAfter written informed consent, four patients with segmental facial hemangioma were treated with propranolol in the neonatal period. Adverse effects were registered during initial admission. Three of the four patients had PHACE syndrome. Propranolol was effective in 100% of patients, showing hemangioma\u00b4s involution without any adverse effect.\nIn our series, propranolol was effective and showed no side effects in the neonatal period. If propranolol benefits are greater than its risks, administration of the lowest effective dose is recommended, under hospital surveillance, starting shortly after diagnosis, in order to achieve improved efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000ccf7","authors":["Villamil, V","M\u00e9ndez Aguirre, N A","Mart\u00ednez Mench\u00f3n, T","Gir\u00f3n Vallejo, O","Fern\u00e1ndez Ibieta, M","Reyes R\u00edos, P Y","Mart\u00ednez Casta\u00f1o, I","Rojas Ticona, J","S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez, A","Hern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez, L","Ruiz Jim\u00e9nez, J I"],"first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T12:45:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0214-1221"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cirug\u00eda pedi\u00e1trica organo oficial de la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Cirug\u00eda Pedi\u00e1trica","last_mentioned_on":1477399507,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27775309"],"pmid":"27775309","pubdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pediatrics"],"title":"[Neonatal use of propranolol for segmental facial hemangiomas].","type":"article","volume":"28"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":5745120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1018776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235117,"mean":12.669056338148,"rank":163129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235117,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":0.74857142857143,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BVMurciasalud\/statuses\/790896972672667648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13017692],"posted_on":"2016-10-25T12:45:07+00:00","author":{"name":"BVirtual Murciasalud","url":"http:\/\/www.murciasalud.es\/bvms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489295536244015104\/WBHTnVIf_normal.png","description":"La Biblioteca de la Consejer\u00eda de Sanidad y el SMS para los profesionales sanitarios de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia.
