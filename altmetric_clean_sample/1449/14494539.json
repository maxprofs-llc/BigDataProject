The technique included biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG as a first enhancement step and R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) coupled to streptavidin for fluorescent labeling as a second improvement on the procedure. A comparison with the conventional indirect immunofluorescence method confirmed the superior results of the R-PE approach. The use of atrazine-free plants (grown in charcoal-filtered water) and a variety of other controls excluded both contaminating atrazine and nonspecific incubation constituents as sources of tissue staining. Pre-incubations to block nonspecific binding sites proved to be unnecessary in this system. The highly sensitive procedure described here might be a useful tool for the localization of tissue-bound pesticides in general and possibly of other haptens as well.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c0","authors":["G Sohn","C Sautter"],"doi":"10.1177\/39.7.1865109","endpage":"926","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T09:53:13+00:00","issns":["0022-1554","1551-5044"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":915148800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/39.7.1865109"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jhc.sagepub.com\/content\/39\/7\/921.full.pdf","pmid":"1865109","pubdate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"921","subjects":["histocytochemistry"],"title":"R-phycoerythrin as a fluorescent label for immunolocalization of bound atrazine residues.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rphycoerythrin-fluorescent-label-immunolocalization-bound-atrazine-residues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6673792,"mean":6.1580464815253,"rank":1553242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4469123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6673792,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99112,"mean":10.721344492539,"rank":29242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":68778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99112,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":438,"mean":2.20352402746,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":438,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
