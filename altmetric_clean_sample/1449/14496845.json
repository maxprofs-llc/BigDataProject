These changes in pH(i) are now shown to be a fundamental regulator of the transitions between dormancy and metabolism: acidification of activated embryo pH(i) by more than 1 unit with carbon dioxide induced a state comparable to natural dormancy, while alkalinization of dormant embryo pH(i) with the weak base ammonia terminated natural dormancy. This demonstration of pH(i)-mediated regulation of cryptobiotic dormancy extends the known scope for pH(i) as a regulator of development to include multicellular stages of the metazoan life cycle.","ads_id":"1983Sci...221..366B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["WILLIAM B.
