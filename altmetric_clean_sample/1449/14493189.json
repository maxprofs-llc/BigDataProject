The health sector's share of the gross national product rose from well under 5 percent in the late 1940s to more than 11 percent in the late 1980s. The expenditures gap has two components: health care prices rose 1.6 percent per annum more rapidly than other prices, while the quantity of health care grew 0.9 percent per annum faster than other quantities. Many factors, including wages, productivity, technology, and insurance contributed to these trends. No single explanation suffices, and no simple solution is apparent.","ads_id":"1990Sci...247..534F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["VR Fuchs"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.2300814","endpage":"538","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T09:37:55+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"4942","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":820454400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.2300814"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/247\/4942\/534.full.pdf","pmid":"2300814","pubdate":"1990-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"534","subjects":["science"],"title":"The health sector's share of the gross national product","type":"article","volume":"247","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-sectors-share-gross-national-product"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6673792,"mean":6.1580464815253,"rank":1553202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4469066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6673792,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99075,"mean":10.72217154854,"rank":29233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":68752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99075,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35274,"mean":30.707651064554,"rank":20211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35274,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":71.933826086957,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
