In this contribution, an in-house reactor system was developed to realize the parallel synthesis of support materials for Ziegler-Natta catalysts for the first time. The developed system enabled parallel synthesis of twenty four Mg(OEt)2 samples with excellent reproducibility and morphological control comparable to a conventional experiment. Our demonstration revealed that the generation of diverse particle characteristics could be achieved through the addition of a third component as a structural modulator, in which the in-house parallel reactor system combined with the first principle component analysis enabled fast screening of effective modulators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006813","authors":["Patchanee Chammingkwan","Minoru Terano","Toshiaki Taniike"],"doi":"10.1021\/acscombsci.7b00010","first_seen_on":"2017-06-12T11:13:40+00:00","issns":["2156-8952","2156-8944"],"journal":"ACS Combinatorial Science","last_mentioned_on":1496941275,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/acscombsci.7b00010"],"pmid":"28371578","pubdate":"2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"High-Throughput Synthesis of Support Materials for Olefin Polymerization Catalyst","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-synthesis-support-materials-olefin-polymerization-catalyst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":7207977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241028,"mean":12.524252112834,"rank":196674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241028,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178,"mean":1.3996497175141,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.30555555555556,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
