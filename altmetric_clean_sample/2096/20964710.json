To our knowledge, we present the first case report of an individual being treated and stabilized with olanzapine monotherapy for this condition.\nWe describe the case of a 53-year-old African American male admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital with one month of behavioral changes including irritability, decreased need for sleep, hyperverbal speech, hypergraphia, and paranoia five months after TBI. Using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) criteria, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with manic features. He was serially evaluated with clinical rating scales to measure symptom severity. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score upon admission was 31, and the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity (CRDPSS) score was initially 9. After eight days of milieu treatment and gradual titration of olanzapine to 15\u2009mg nightly, his symptoms completely abated, with YMRS and CRDPSS scores at zero on the day of discharge.\nOlanzapine was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of mania following TBI.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef682a83ee09648b4fa4","authors":["Cittolin-Santos, Giordano F."],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/7541307","first_seen_on":"2017-06-12T09:28:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2090-682X","2090-6838"],"journal":"Case Reports in Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1497259697,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/crips\/2017\/7541307\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1155\/2017\/7541307"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/crips\/2017\/7541307.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5485283","pmid":"28695036","pubdate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"A Case Report of Mania and Psychosis Five Months after Traumatic Brain Injury Successfully Treated Using Olanzapine","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-report-mania-psychosis-five-months-after-traumatic-brain-injury-successfully-treated-using-olan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":6340123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1132644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241853,"mean":12.612881993947,"rank":171167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241853,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":3.0803939393939,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.2033333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/874196649517690881","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20964710],"posted_on":"2017-06-12T09:28:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":984},"tweet_id":"874196649517690881"}],"facebook":[{"title":"A Case Report of Mania and Psychosis Five Months after Traumatic Brain Injury Successfully Treated Using Olanzapine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1506597042744008&id=450103581726698","license":"public","citation_ids":[20964710],"posted_on":"2017-06-12T09:28:11+00:00","summary":"Case Reports in Psychiatry\nA Case Report of Mania and Psychosis Five Months after Traumatic Brain Injury Successfully Treated Using Olanzapine Background.
