Less favorable body composition and adipokines in South Asians","Time for better diet and exercise my South Asian people!!","I knew south asians had less favorable body composition from 30+ years of personal observation"],"citation":{"abstract":"Small studies have shown that South Asians (SAs) have more total body, subcutaneous, visceral and hepatic fat and abnormal adipokine levels compared to Whites. However, comprehensive studies of body composition and adipokines in SAs compared to other ethnic groups are lacking.\nUsing harmonized data, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of two community-based cohorts: Mediators of Atherosclerosis of South Asians Living in America (MASALA, n=906) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA which included 2,622 Whites; 803 Chinese Americans; 1,893 African Americans; and 1,496 Latinos). General linear models were developed to assess ethnic differences in ectopic fat (visceral, intermuscular, and pericardial fat; and hepatic attenuation), lean muscle mass, and adipokines (adiponectin and resistin). Models were adjusted for age, sex, site, alcohol use, smoking, exercise, education, household income and BMI. Ectopic fat models were additionally adjusted for hypertension, diabetes, HDL, and triglycerides. Adipokine models were adjusted for subcutaneous, visceral, intermuscular, and pericardial fat; and hepatic attenuation.\nCompared to all ethnic groups in MESA (Whites, Chinese Americans, African Americans, and Latinos), SAs had greater intermuscular fat (pairwise comparisons to each MESA group, P<0.01), lower hepatic attenuation (P<0.001), and less lean mass (P<0.001). SAs had greater visceral fat compared to Chinese Americans, African Americans and Latinos (P<0.05) and greater pericardial fat compared to African Americans (P<0.001). SAs had lower adiponectin levels compared to other ethnic groups (P<0.01; except Chinese Americans) and higher resistin levels than all groups (P<0.001), even after adjusting for differences in body composition.\nThere are significant ethnic differences in ectopic fat, lean mass, and adipokines. A less favorable body composition and adipokine profile in South Asians may partially explain the increased predisposition to cardiometabolic disease. The mechanisms that underlie these differences warrant further investigation.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 26 October 2015. doi:10.1038\/ijo.2015.219.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["A D Shah","N R Kandula","F Lin","M A Allison","J Carr","D Herrington","K Liu","A M Kanaya"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2015.219","endpage":"645","first_seen_on":"2017-05-20T18:55:13+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0307-0565","1476-5497"],"journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1495392947,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v40\/n4\/full\/ijo2015219a.html"],"pmid":"26499444","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"639","subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Less favorable body composition and adipokines in South Asians compared with other US ethnic groups: results from the MASALA and MESA studies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/less-favorable-body-composition-adipokines-south-asians-compared-other-ethnic-groups-results-masala"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":4.05,"6m":4.05,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":1801426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6439126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236899,"mean":12.170544875854,"rank":67000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":169466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236899,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2447,"mean":16.080681929681,"rank":1282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2447,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":23.905025641026,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
