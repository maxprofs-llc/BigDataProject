Detection and identification of Brucella species are essential to prevent or treat brucellosis in humans and animals. The outer membrane protein-31 (Omp31) is a major protein of Brucellae except for B. abortus, while the Omp31 antigenic epitopes have not been extensively characterized yet.\nA total of 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced against Omp31 of Brucella (B.) melitensis, of which 13 recognized five linear epitopes, 7 reacted with semi-conformational epitopes and 2 reacted with conformational epitopes, respectively. The mAb isotypes were 11 (50%) IgG2a, 5 (23%) IgG1 and 6 (27%) IgM. On the basis of epitope recognition and reactivity levels, 8 mAbs including 3 IgM and 5 IgG clones were considered as highly reactive and potentially diagnostic antibodies. Among these mAbs, 7A3 (IgG1), 5B1 (IgG2a), 2C1 (IgG2a) and 5B3 (IgG2a) reacted with differently conserved linear epitopes of B. melitensis, B. ovis, B. suis and B. canis strains, while 5H3 (IgG2a) highly reacted with a conformational epitope of Omp31 when tested with several immunoassays.\nThese potent monoclonal antibodies can be used for identifying Omp31 antigens or detecting B. melitensis and other Brucella species beyond B. abortus in vitro or in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007c8","authors":["Jinfeng Li","Feihuan Hu","Shouyi Chen","Peifang Luo","Zuoping He","Wenjing Wang","Jean-Pierre Allain","Chengyao Li","Jinfeng Li","Feihuan Hu","Shouyi Chen","Peifang Luo","Zuoping He","Wenjing Wang","Jean-Pierre Allain","Chengyao Li"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12866-017-1025-3","first_seen_on":"2017-05-20T21:17:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2180"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1495315036,"links":["https:\/\/bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12866-017-1025-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12866-017-1025-3?site=bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28506316","pubdate":"2017-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Microscopy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Mycology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"115","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Characterization of novel Omp31 antigenic epitopes of Brucella melitensis by monoclonal antibodies","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-novel-omp31-antigenic-epitopes-brucella-melitensis-monoclonal-antibodies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":7131302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236344,"mean":12.182528401518,"rank":191604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236344,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1368,"mean":3.1523994147769,"rank":1107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.730085106383,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BIOCIENCIA2013\/statuses\/866040148835880960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20335789],"posted_on":"2017-05-20T21:17:16+00:00","author":{"name":"BIOCIENCIA","url":"http:\/\/musical100fm.com.ve\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000300217090\/9b25d5f581a95fff46afd4d8d0d0aad0_normal.jpeg","description":"Programa radial de enfermedades, avances tecnol\u00f3gicos, eventos cient\u00edficos de inter\u00e9s, noticias, entrevistas","id_on_source":"BIOCIENCIA2013","tweeter_id":"1672141952","geo":{"lt":10.46354,"ln":-64.1775,"country":"VE"},"followers":902},"tweet_id":"866040148835880960"}]}}
