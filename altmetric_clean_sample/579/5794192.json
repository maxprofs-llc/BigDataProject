Data come from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Americans aged 51-61 in 1991, followed every 2 years from 1992 to 1998. Smoking status is evaluated at each of three follow-ups, (1994, 1996, and 1998) as a function of health events between each of the four waves. Acute and chronic health events are associated with much lower likelihood of smoking both in the wave immediately following the event and up to 6 years later. However, future events do not retrospectively predict past cessation. In sum, serious health events have substantial impacts on cessation rates of older smokers. Notably, these effects persist for as much as 6 years after a health event.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Falba, Tracy","Tracy Falba"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10865-005-2560-1","endpage":"33","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T20:00:07+00:00","handle":"10161\/2864","handles":["10161\/2864"],"isbns":[],"issns":["0160-7715","1573-3521"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Behavioral Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1405296000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10865-005-2560-1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10865-005-2560-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10865-005-2560-1.pdf","pmid":"15887873","pubdate":"2005-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"21","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Health events and the smoking cessation of middle aged Americans.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10865-005-2560-1","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/health-events-smoking-cessation-middle-aged-americans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7779875,"mean":6.6346658333997,"rank":1905908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4821049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7779875,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287677,"mean":10.502609178381,"rank":89593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":191928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287677,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":6.7314368932039,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.8673076923077,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
