Aim of this study was to investigate cytokines derived from antigen-presenting cells (APC) and their relation to CD4+ T cell subpopulations and to the auto-ab response in pemphigus. In this regard, patients with pemphigus were compared to patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an unrelated auto-ab-mediated autoimmune disease, and healthy controls. In pemphigus and MG, the plasma concentrations of the APC-derived immunomodulatory cytokine IL-27 were highly increased. Strikingly, IL-27 strongly correlated with Dsg-specific IgG auto-ab titers. T helper (Th) 17 cells were augmented in both pemphigus and MG patients while T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which are essential in providing B cell help, were increased only in pemphigus along with increasing plasma concentrations of IL-21, a cytokine produced by Th17 and Tfh cells. Moreover, we could detect Dsg3-specific autoreactive T cells producing IL-21 upon ex vivo stimulation with Dsg3. These findings suggest that IL-27 and IL-21-producing T cells, are involved in the pathogenesis of pemphigus. The further characterization of IL-21-producing T cells and of the role of IL-27 will lead to a more defined understanding of the auto-ab response in pemphigus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hennerici, Tina","Pollmann, Robert","Schmidt, Thomas","Seipelt, Maria","Tackenberg, Bj\u00f6rn","M\u00f6bs, Christian","Ghoreschi, Kamran","Hertl, Michael","Eming, R\u00fcdiger","Tina Hennerici","Robert Pollmann","Thomas Schmidt","Maria Seipelt","Bj\u00f6rn Tackenberg","Christian M\u00f6bs","Kamran Ghoreschi","Michael Hertl","R\u00fcdiger Eming"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0148919","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T11:17:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1468530245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872212?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0148919"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148919&type=printable","pmid":"26872212","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:00:09+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Increased Frequency of T Follicular Helper Cells and Elevated Interleukin-27 Plasma Levels in Patients with Pemphigus","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0148919","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-frequency-t-follicular-helper-cells-elevated-interleukin27-plasma-levels-patients-pemphigu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071125,"mean":6.8533209909723,"rank":5843268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1941664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071125,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":332130,"mean":9.862821156839,"rank":212775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":100092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":332130,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112369,"mean":10.55238418411,"rank":76783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":30056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112369,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5415,"mean":12.133849279645,"rank":3919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5415,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
