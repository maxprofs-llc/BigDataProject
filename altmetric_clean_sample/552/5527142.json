In this study, we report the first case, to our knowledge, of thalidomide-induced acute exacerbation and reactivation of chronic HCV infection complicating management of multiple myeloma. Sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy helped achieve viral clearance and normalization of liver enzymes, thus allowing access to future potentially life-saving chemotherapy agents.","altmetric_jid":"554b86a12a83ee864e8b45e5","authors":["Parag Mahale","Sheeba K.
