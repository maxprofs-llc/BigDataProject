Twenty-four of the 57 wastewater samples (42.1%) and one of the 57 surface-water samples (1.7%, a river that received effluents of a wastewater-treatment-plant) contained ESBL-Eb or pAmpC-Eb; one ESBL\/pAmpC-Eb per positive sample was further characterized. Beta-lactamase genes detected were as follows: blaCTX-M-1 (10 Escherichia coli),blaCTX-M-15 (eight E. coli, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Citrobacter freundii), blaCTX-M-14 (one E. coli) and blaCMY-2 (four E. coli). The blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1 or blaSHV-1 genes were also found in 72% of these isolates. The ISEcp1, orf477 or IS903 sequences were found upstream or downstream of blaCTX-M genes. Class 1 integrons were present in 16 of the 25 ESBL-Eb\/pAmpC-Eb strains (64%), and contained five different gene-cassette arrays. Most of the strains (76%) showed a multiresistant phenotype and qnr genes were identified in four strains. Molecular typing of ESBL\/CMY-2-producing E. coli isolates showed 23 different PFGE-patterns and 15 different sequence-types (ST10, ST46, ST48, ST58, ST69, ST101, ST117, ST131, ST141, ST288, ST359, ST399, ST405, ST617, and the new ST4530); these strains were ascribed to phylogroups A (11 isolates), B1 (3 isolates), D (6 isolates) and B2 (3 isolates). From one to five plasmids were detected in each strain (size from 30kb to >240kb) and ESBL or pAmpC genes were transferred by conjugation in 69.5% of the E. coli strains. In conclusion, ESBL-Eb and pAmpC-Eb strains are frequently detected in wastewater samples and they might be a source for dissemination in other environments with repercussion in public health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["Ben Said, Leila","Jouini, Ahlem","Alonso, Carla Andrea","Klibi, Naouel","Dziri, Raoudha","Boudabous, Abdellatif","Ben Slama, Karim","Torres, Carmen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.01.042","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T11:17:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1456901887,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26871556?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26871556","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Characteristics of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)- and pAmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae of water samples in Tunisia","type":"article","volume":"550","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characteristics-extendedspectrum-%CE%B2lactamase-esbl-pampc-betalactamaseproducing-enterobacteriaceae-wat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":3761500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2059739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322106,"mean":9.6767798947544,"rank":170438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":116353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322106,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4345,"mean":4.7832288213628,"rank":2775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4345,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":6.512064516129,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
