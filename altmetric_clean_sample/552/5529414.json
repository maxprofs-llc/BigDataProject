Here, we review newly identified, naturally occurring '[4+2] cycloadditionases' and 'spiroketalases' and reveal several similarities between the two types of enzymes. During catalysis, these enzymes control product stereochemistry or\/and enhance the transformation rate. They exhibit convergent evolution of [4+2] cycloaddition or spiroketalization activity, which is likely dependent on interactions of variable protein folds with specialized chemical structures. An understanding of these similarities is expected to allow for establishment of the underlying principles for the application and catalyst design of associated enzymatic reactions in organic chemistry and synthetic biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Zheng, Qingfei","Tian, Zhenhua","Liu, Wen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2016.01.020","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T11:03:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0402","13675931"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1455677643,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26870924?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1367593116300059"],"pmid":"26870924","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:00:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Recent advances in understanding the enzymatic reactions of [4+2] cycloaddition and spiroketalization.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-advances-understanding-enzymatic-reactions-42-cycloaddition-spiroketalization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":5168526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1782572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320949,"mean":9.6488454765254,"rank":204744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":97898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320949,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":691,"mean":2.6086579710145,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":691,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.6055555555556,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
