Moreover, they are essential tools in all sectors of life sciences. Although the great majority of monoclonal antibodies currently in use are of mouse origin, the use of human B cells to generate monoclonal antibodies is increasing as new techniques to tap the human B cell repertoire are rapidly emerging. Cloned lines of immortalized human B cells are ideal sources of monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we summarize our studies to the regulation of the replicative life span, differentiation, and maturation of B cells that led to the development of a platform that uses immortalization of human B cells by in vitro genetic modification for antibody development. We describe a number of human antibodies that were isolated using this platform and the application of the technique in other species. We also discuss the use of immortalized B cells as antigen-presenting cells for the discovery of tumor neoantigens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a98","authors":["Kwakkenbos, Mark J","van Helden, Pauline M","Beaumont, Tim","Spits, Hergen"],"doi":"10.1111\/imr.12395","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T11:03:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-065X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Immunological Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1455367685,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26864105?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26864105?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=immunegc_papers"],"pmid":"26864105","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:03:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Stable long-term cultures of self-renewing B cells and their applications","type":"article","volume":"270","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stable-longterm-cultures-selfrenewing-b-cells-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":3627220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2044992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6305759515573,"rank":169235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":116570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":617,"mean":3.1354383116883,"rank":375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":617,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.483,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
