However, the roles of TLR4 in the activation of B cells and production of anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies in vivo have been rarely studied. This study aimed to investigate the activation of B cells from TLR4-defective (C3H\/HeJ) and TLR4-intact (C3H\/HeN) mice pre-immunized with human \u03b22GPI. After \u03b22GPI injection, the level of anti-\u03b22GPI antibody in the serum of TLR4-defective and TLR4-intact mice was gradually increased and the number and size of germinal centers in the spleen were also significantly increased. Compared with C3H\/HeJ mice, we observed significantly higher anti-\u03b22GPI antibody titer and more germinal centers in C3H\/HeN mice. Moreover, the \u03b22GPI-induced expression of CD40L, CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC II in C3H\/HeN mice was significantly higher than that in C3H\/HeJ mice. Furthermore, the \u03b22GPI-induced expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF) in the spleen and IL-6 and IL-10 in B cells from C3H\/HeN mice was also significantly increased compared to C3H\/HeJ mice. Taken together, our results suggest that TLR4 is required for the activation of B cells and the production of autoantibody in mice treated with \u03b22GPI, but the immunological mechanisms of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) need further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003116","authors":["Cheng, Si","He, Chao","Zhou, Hong","Kong, Xiangmin","Xie, Hongxiang","Xia, Longfei","Yan, Jinchuan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molimm.2016.01.012","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T11:11:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-9142"],"journal":"Molecular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1455366909,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872007?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=immunegc_papers","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872007?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26872007?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26872007","pubdate":"2016-02-13T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"The effect of Toll-like receptor 4 on \u03b22-glycoprotein I-induced B cell activation in mouse model.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-tolllike-receptor-4-2glycoprotein-iinduced-b-cell-activation-mouse-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":2904419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4178925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320712,"mean":9.6305681563772,"rank":122190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":192576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320712,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":918,"mean":1.8903402399128,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":918,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.30625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ImmuneGC_Papers\/statuses\/698464406796013568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5529576],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T11:11:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmuneGCPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/686613538853396480\/Q7XNQGGq_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot #GC papers #PubMed | \u22652016 | #GerminalCenters are formed during #immunity for #evolution of #antibodies & #Bcell memory | Curated @mmw_lmw","id_on_source":"ImmuneGC_Papers","tweeter_id":"4734596798","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":19},"tweet_id":"698464406796013568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ImmunologyNews_\/statuses\/698474221920342016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5529576],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T11:50:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Immunology News","url":"http:\/\/biotech-365.com\/immunology-news\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/560865941488013312\/bJo2QJL2_normal.jpeg","description":"Immunology News : http:\/\/biotech-365.com\/immunology-news\/ #immunology #immuno @Biotech365","id_on_source":"ImmunologyNews_","tweeter_id":"3004214811","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1209},"tweet_id":"698474221920342016"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DCell_papers\/statuses\/698485559430283264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5529576],"posted_on":"2016-02-13T12:35:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dendritic cells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444106482712182784\/jm3fnA5u_normal.jpeg","description":"Journal paper feed for academics interested in dendritic cells, immunology and immunity (image source: NIH)","id_on_source":"DCell_papers","tweeter_id":"2386845055","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"698485559430283264"}]}}
