Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating OA process. Autophagy has an important effect on the OA process, and it is believed to be regulated by MAPKs. To reveal the mechanism and the effect of JNK and p38 MAPKs on matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and autophagy in OA, the study established OA model in rabbits, used the measurement of the Osteoarthritis Research Society International scoring system to evaluate OA model, and conducted general observation, histological observation, and Western blotting of JNK, phosphorylate-JNK (P-JNK), p38, phosphorylate-p38 (P-p38), MMP3, and light-chain 3 (LC3)-II\/LC3-I to explore the variation of JNK, p38 MAPKs, and autophagy at the early stage of OA. With OA progressing at the early stage, MMP3, P-p38, and P-JNK were gradually upregulated from the baseline to the peak in study groups when compared with the control group; JNK and p38 variated of turbulence without statistical difference; and LC3-II\/LC3-I had a decreasing tendency from the 0- to 15-day group. This study identifies that compromised autophagy may be related to the OA progress and that JNK and p38 MAPKs have positive regulation on MMP3 and negative regulation on autophagy. It also implicates a new therapeutic strategy for OA and other degenerate diseases based on selective MAPK inhibitors, reduction of MMP3, and autophagy. \u00a9 2016 IUBMB Life, 2016.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c35","authors":["Shi, Jie","Zhang, Changjie","Yi, Zhongjie","Lan, Chunna"],"doi":"10.1002\/iub.1482","endpage":"302","first_seen_on":"2016-02-13T07:12:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-6551"],"issue":"4","journal":"IUBMB Life","last_mentioned_on":1455449196,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/iub.1482&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26873249?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/iub.1482\/pdf","pmid":"26873249","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"293","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Explore the variation of MMP3, JNK, p38 MAPKs, and autophagy at the early stage of osteoarthritis","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/explore-variation-mmp3-jnk-p38-mapks-autophagy-early-stage-osteoarthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7191979,"mean":6.3236280124852,"rank":3630066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2046276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7191979,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320703,"mean":9.6347815666877,"rank":169246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":116545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320703,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":2.1476020408163,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.3630434782609,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
