AR\/ER\u03b1\/ER\u03b2\/GR\/PR was positive in 20%\/18%\/62%\/63%\/16% of tumors, which was significantly lower (except PR) than in benign urothelial tissues [57% (P < 0.001)\/40% (P = 0.001)\/85% (P = 0.001)\/84% (P = 0.002)\/13% (P = 0.489)]. There were no significant associations between each receptor expression pattern and histopathological characteristic of the tumors including tumor grade\/stage. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed no significant prognostic value of each receptor expression in these 99 patients. However, patients with UUTUC positive for either ER\u03b1 or PR had a significantly higher risk of disease-specific mortality (P = 0.025), compared with those with UUTUC negative for both. PR positivity alone in pT3 or pT4 tumors was also strongly associated with the risk of disease-specific mortality (P = 0.040). Multivariate analysis further identified the expression of ER\u03b1 and\/or PR as a strong predictor for disease-specific mortality in the entire cohort of the patients (hazard ratio, 2.434; P = 0.037). Thus, in accordance with previous observations in bladder specimens, significant decreases in the expression of AR\/ER\u03b1\/ER\u03b2\/GR in UUTUC, compared with that in non-neoplastic urothelium, were observed. Meanwhile, the negativity of both ER\u03b1 and PR in UUTUC as well as the negativity of PR alone in deeply invasive tumor was suggested to serve as a prognosticator.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc7","authors":["Eiji Kashiwagi","Kazutoshi Fujita","Seiji Yamaguchi","Hiroaki Fushimi","Hiroki Ide","Satoshi Inoue","Taichi Mizushima","Leonardo O.
