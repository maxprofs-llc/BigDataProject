In such situations, where there are some medical benefits and the costs are not prohibitive, it is important to consider the psychosocial implications of screening. This paper reviews the evidence on the psychosocial issues raised by newborn screening for cystic fibrosis, in particular the issues of parental attitudes to screening, the evidence from families with an affected infant, the evidence from families with a carrier infant and the lessons for service delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008434","authors":["Evelyn P Parsons","Donald M Bradley"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1526-0542(03)00086-1","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T07:15:35+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["15260542","1526-0542"],"issue":"4","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1097798400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1526-0542(03)00086-1"],"pmid":"14629950","pubdate":"2003-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Psychosocial issues in newborn screening for cystic fibrosis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1526054203000861","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychosocial-issues-newborn-screening-cystic-fibrosis-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7316025,"mean":6.3738948415102,"rank":1744056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4610717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7316025,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91072,"mean":12.502407418388,"rank":29815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":59627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91072,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294,"mean":1.7914948805461,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis; a evaluation of benefits and risks and recommendations for state newborn screening programs","url":"https:\/\/stacks.cdc.gov\/view\/cdc\/13354\/cdc_13354_DS1.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[4315525,1428856,16792693,16868279,16868280,16868281,16868282,16868283,15796147,16868284,16868285,16868287,16868288,16868289,7589879,16175459,16868290,16868291,16868292,5959394,16868294,16868295,16868296,16868297,3812371,16868299,16868300,16868301,16868302,2412772,16210266,14486477,16868303,16868306,16868308,16868310,16868313,16868314,3164413,16868316,16868317,15735384,16868318,16868319,16195346,16812423,16868324,3812370,15562917,16868326,2750606,3208110,16175466,16868327,16868328,16195363,16868329,1944116,16792678,15639640,16175467,16868330,2341735,16868332,14486740,14486580,14973202,16868333,16868335,16868336,16868337,3163662,16868338,16868339,16868340,16868341,16868342,16868343,16868345,16868346,16868347,16868348,16868349,16175461,563199,16868362,16210253,1140202,16868363],"posted_on":"2004-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","description":"CDC is America\u2019s leading public health agency, dedicated to saving and protecting the health of Americans.
