There is an ongoing debate whether such adjustments result from adaptive processes that serve to optimize performance or whether they reflect interference from error monitoring or attentional orientation. The present study aimed at identifying adaptive adjustments in a two-stage visual search task, in which participants had to select and subsequently identify a target stimulus presented to the left or right visual hemifield. Target selection and identification can be measured by two distinct event-related potentials, the N2pc and the SPCN. Using a decoder analysis based on multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to isolate the processing stages related to error sources and post-error adjustments. Whereas errors were linked to deviations in the N2pc and the SPCN, only for the N2pc we identified a post-error adjustment, which exhibits key features of source-specific adaptivity. While errors were associated with an increased N2pc, post-error adjustments consisted in an N2pc decrease. We interpret this as an adaptive adjustment of target selection to prevent errors due to disproportionate processing of the task-irrelevant target location. Our study thus provides evidence for adaptive post-error adjustments in visual search.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Robert Steinhauser","Martin E.
