The aim of this study was to develop and validate a mainland Chinese version of IBD quality-of-life questionnaire for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).\nA draft questionnaire containing 30 items was generated from a descriptive qualitative study, literature review and consulting with IBD patients and experts. The validity, discriminant ability, reliability, and sensitivity to change were validated in 336 patients with IBD.\nA 22-item IBD quality-of-life questionnaire (IBDQOL-22) with 4 domains was developed. The 4 domain scores of the IBDQOL-22 correlated well with the related SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey) dimensional scores in UC (r = 0.42-0.75) and CD (r = 0.41-0.66). The total scores of the IBDQOL-22 correlated well with the physical component summary scores of the SF-36 in UC (r = 0.74) and CD (r = 0.74), the mental component summary scores of the SF-36 in UC (r = 0.77) and CD (r = 0.71), the colitis activity index in UC (r = -0.61) and the CD activity index (r = -0.53). It was able to discriminate between patients with active and inactive disease. Cronbach's alpha for the 4 domains of the IBDQOL-22 ranged from 0.77 to 0.90 in UC and from 0.76 to 0.89 in CD. Test-retest reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.88-0.95 in UC and 0.72-0.90 in CD). The 3 domains of the IBDQOL-22 (emotional function, symptoms and discomfort, bowel symptoms and its influences) were able to detect changes in patients whose clinical activity index changed more than one point.\nThe IBDQOL-22 is a valid, reliable, and responsive instrument for assessing disease-specific quality-of-life in patients with IBD in Mainland China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Ruan, Jiayin","Chen, Yan","Zhou, Yunxian"],"doi":"10.1097\/mib.0000000000001024","first_seen_on":"2017-03-01T04:23:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1078-0998"],"issue":"3","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1488211583,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/03000\/Development_and_Validation_of_a_Questionnaire_to.11.aspx?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/2017\/03000\/Development_and_Validation_of_a_Questionnaire_to.11.pdf","pmid":"28129287","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"431","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Development and Validation of a Questionnaire to Assess the Quality of Life in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Mainland China","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ibdjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/03000\/Development_and_Validation_of_a_Questionnaire_to.11.aspx","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-validation-questionnaire-assess-quality-life-patients-inflammatory-bowel-disease-mainlan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":7162706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242049,"mean":13.68383520624,"rank":201368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242049,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1658,"mean":3.731388050694,"rank":1432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1658,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":4.9442682926829,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Development and Validation of a Questionnaire to Assess the Quality of Life in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Mainland China","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1831712923717921&id=1726172367605311","license":"public","citation_ids":[16865708],"posted_on":"2017-02-27T16:06:23+00:00","summary":"Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects the quality of patients' life in many ways.
