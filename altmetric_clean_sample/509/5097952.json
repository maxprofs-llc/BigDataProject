Given the highly heterogeneous nature of DLBCL, it is not clear whether all subtypes of DLBCL will be susceptible to PI3K pathway inhibition, or which kinase within this pathway is the most favorable target. Pharmacological profiling of a panel of DLBCL cell lines revealed a subset of DLBCL that was resistant to AKT inhibition. Strikingly, sensitivity to AKT inhibitors correlated with the ability of these inhibitors to block phosphorylation of S6K1 and ribosomal protein S6. Cell lines resistant to AKT inhibition activated S6K1 independent of AKT either through upregulation of PIM2 or through activation by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling components. Finally, combined inhibition of AKT and BTK, PIM2, or S6K1 proved to be an effective strategy to overcome resistance to AKT inhibition in DLBCL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Ezell, Scott A","Wang, Suping","Bihani, Teeru","Lai, Zhongwu","Grosskurth, Shaun E","Tepsuporn, Suprawee","Davies, Barry R","Huszar, Dennis","Byth, Kate F"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.7036","first_seen_on":"2016-02-05T14:33:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"8","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1454682805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26824321"],"pmcid":"PMC4891033","pmid":"26824321","pubdate":"2016-02-05T22:08:27+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Differential regulation of mTOR signaling determines sensitivity to AKT inhibition in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-regulation-mtor-signaling-determines-sensitivity-akt-inhibition-diffuse-large-b-cell-ly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":6111323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319350,"mean":9.4319727758656,"rank":264133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319350,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6498,"mean":2.6293144528244,"rank":4240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6498,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":675,"mean":1.3601661721068,"rank":473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":675,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
