This study examined the relationship of ADHD with adult personality traits and disorders in a sample that included individuals pre-screened for elevated childhood ADHD symptoms. Four hundred thirty-nine undergraduates completed retrospective reports of childhood ADHD symptoms as well as current ratings of ADHD symptoms, traditional PD categories, and the DSM-5 alternative PD trait model. To overcome potential biases in self-report, 161 parents of the participants provided ratings of childhood and current functioning. Results suggest that while self-report of ADHD was significantly correlated with several PDs, parent reports obtained somewhat more specific links with adult dependent, borderline, and paranoid PDs. Most importantly, the DSM-5 Section III dimensional trait model provided greater specificity, as the trait of distractibility consistently emerged as a unique predictor, and thus appeared more useful for understanding the developmental pathways of ADHD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb4","authors":["Smith, Tess E","Samuel, Douglas B","Tess E.
