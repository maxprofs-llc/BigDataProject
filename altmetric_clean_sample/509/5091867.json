This natural process in the female life cycle has been of concern to women after menopause. Changes in different biophysical and psychosocial aspects, and their individual experiences, have repercussions on the lives of patients seeking specialized and multidisciplinary support to reduce the harmful effects of prolonged hypoestrogenism. Overweight and obesity, inadequate living habits and the presence of multi-morbidities cause damage to the quality of life and impact the functional capacity. Behavioral prescription and hormone therapy are among the treatments given to ease symptoms and reduce morbidity. A better understanding of these factors can help identify groups that require more care after menopause.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e32a83eeb12a8b4b27","authors":["Sorpreso, Isabel Cristina Esposito","Soares J\u00fanior, Jos\u00e9 Maria","Fonseca, Angela Maggio da","Baracat, Edmund Chada"],"doi":"10.1590\/1806-9282.61.06.553","first_seen_on":"2016-02-04T15:42:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0104-4230"],"issue":"6","journal":"Revista da Associa\u00e7\u00e3o M\u00e9dica Brasileira","last_mentioned_on":1454596882,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26841166"],"pmid":"26841166","pubdate":"2016-02-04T22:00:12+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Female aging.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/female-aging-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7099316,"mean":6.2990871854507,"rank":5324133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7099316,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318983,"mean":9.3834011887815,"rank":220306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318983,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":1.6469792284866,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.6571428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
