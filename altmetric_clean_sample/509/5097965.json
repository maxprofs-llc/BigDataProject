This enzyme consists of 196 amino acids containing 2-Cys Prx with highly conserved two active cysteine residues at positions 48 and 171. The yPrxII has dual enzymatic functions as a peroxidase and molecular chaperone. To understand the effect of additional cysteine residues on dual functions of yPrxII, S79C-yPrxII and S109C-yPrxII, the substitution of Ser with Cys residue at 79 and 109 positions, respectively, was generated. S109C-yPrxII and S79C-yPrxII showed 3.7- and 2.7-fold higher chaperone and peroxidase activity, respectively, than the wild type (WT). The improvement in enzyme activity was found to be closely associated with structural changes in proteins. S109C-yPrxII had increased \u03b2-sheet in its secondary structure and formed high-molecular-weight (HMW) as well as low-molecular-weight (LMW) complexes, but S79C-yPrxII formed only LMW complexes. HMW complexes predominantly exhibited a chaperone function, and LMW complexes showed a peroxidase function. In addition, transgenic yeast cells over-expressing Cys-substituted yPrxII showed greater tolerance against heat and oxidative stress compared to WT-yPrxII.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033cc","authors":["Hong, Sung Hyun","Lee, Seung Sik","Chung, Jeong Min","Jung, Hyun Suk","Singh, Sudhir","Mondal, Suvendu","Jang, Ho Hee","Cho, Jae-Young","Bae, Hyeun-Jong","Chung, Byung Yeoup"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00709-016-0948-0","first_seen_on":"2016-02-05T14:34:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1615-6102"],"journal":"Protoplasma","last_mentioned_on":1454682853,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26843371?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26843371","pubdate":"2016-02-05T22:01:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Site-specific mutagenesis of yeast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin improves heat or oxidative stress tolerance by enhancing its chaperone or peroxidase function.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sitespecific-mutagenesis-yeast-2cys-peroxiredoxin-improves-heat-oxidative-stress-tolerance-enhancing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":5327405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":991854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319350,"mean":9.4319735587082,"rank":220662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319350,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":1.4039566563467,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.2458,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
