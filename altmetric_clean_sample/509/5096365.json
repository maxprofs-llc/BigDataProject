A 70-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital after complaining of bloody stools. He was diagnosed with advanced sigmoid colon cancer, T2N2aM1b, Stage IV B. After 3 cycles of mFOLFOX6 plus panitumumab as first-line chemotherapy, he received FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab as second-line chemotherapy because of progressive disease. Aprepitant and steroids were administered as antiemetic agents for a short period during each chemotherapy session. During the 2 cycle of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, he developed a high fever without respiratory symptoms. Chest CT revealed ground-glass opacities in both the lungs. We first treated him with antibiotics(PIPC\/TAZ plus GRNX), suspecting bacterial pneumonia. However, based on the elevation of serum b -D-glucan(148 pg\/mL), we diagnosed PCP and initiated SMX\/TMP in addition to PIPC\/TAZ. The inflammation promptly decreased, and follow-up chest CT revealed the disappearance of the ground-glass opacities. If a patient develops a fever or respiratory symptoms during a course of chemotherapy, we should consider the possibility of PCP and perform careful examinations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf4","authors":["Fujiwara, Yushi","Lee, Shigeru","Kishida, Satoru","Hashiba, Ryoya","Gyobu, Ken","Osugi, Harushi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-05T11:58:09+00:00","issns":["0385-0684"],"issue":"11","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho Cancer chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1454670037,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26602404?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26602404","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"[Pneumocystis Pneumonia during Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Advanced Colon Cancer - A Case Report].","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pneumocystis-pneumonia-during-adjuvant-chemotherapy-advanced-colon-cancer-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":5327353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319351,"mean":9.4318558759978,"rank":220648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319351,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":1.2623135464231,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.46166666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
