Using co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, we uncovered an interaction between RAS and Argonaute 2 (AGO2). Endogenously, RAS and AGO2 co-sediment and co-localize in the endoplasmic reticulum. The AGO2 N-terminal domain directly binds the Switch II region of KRAS, agnostic of nucleotide (GDP\/GTP) binding. Functionally, AGO2 knockdown\u00a0attenuates cell proliferation in mutant KRAS-dependent\u00a0cells and AGO2 overexpression enhances\u00a0KRAS(G12V)-mediated transformation. Using AGO2-\/- cells, we demonstrate that the RAS-AGO2 interaction is required for maximal mutant KRAS expression and cellular transformation. Mechanistically, oncogenic KRAS attenuates AGO2-mediated gene silencing. Overall, the functional interaction with AGO2 extends KRAS function beyond its canonical role in signaling.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Sunita Shankar","Sethuramasundaram Pitchiaya","Rohit Malik","Vishal Kothari","Yasuyuki Hosono","Anastasia\u00a0K.
