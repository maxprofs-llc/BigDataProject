To select neurons involved in memory formation, neural competition might be essential. In this paper, we show that excitable neurons are competitive and organize into two assemblies in a recurrent network with spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP) and axonal conduction delays. Neural competition is established by the cooperation of spontaneously induced neural oscillation, axonal conduction delays, and STDP. We also suggest that the competition mechanism in this paper is one of the basic functions required to organize memory-storing subnetworks into fine-scale cortical networks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kato, Hideyuki","Ikeguchi, Tohru"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0146044","first_seen_on":"2016-02-04T11:38:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1454585894,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26840529?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26840529","pubdate":"2016-02-04T22:00:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Oscillation, Conduction Delays, and Learning Cooperate to Establish Neural Competition in Recurrent Networks.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oscillation-conduction-delays-learning-cooperate-establish-neural-competition-recurrent-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7099316,"mean":6.2990871854507,"rank":3546583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2039245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7099316,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318983,"mean":9.383378146729,"rank":166966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":117253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318983,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103661,"mean":10.052094848543,"rank":59959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":32633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103661,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5226,"mean":11.473337033493,"rank":3303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5226,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
