The examined sampling included 73 children with functional dyspepsia aged from 4 to 6 years. The comparison group according common characteristic of microbiota of large intestine included 100 healthy children comparative by age. In 32 out of all examined children species specter of bifidobacteria in intestine was analyzed. The species diagnostic of bifidobacteria was implemented by using technique of polymerase chain reaction. In children with functional dyspepsia the analysis established dysbiosis alterations in intestinal biotope, characterizing by deficiency of bifidobacteria and selection of opportunistic microorganisms. The alteration of species structure of bifidobacteria in children with functional dyspepsia is demonstrated: decreasing of prevalence of populations of Bifidobacterium catenulatum and appearance of rare species of bifidobacteria B. dentium and B. angulatum. The differences are established concerning formation of species preference of bifidobacteria in conditions of conjoint vegetation in intestinal biotope of children with functional dyspepsia and in healthy children. The comprehensive analysis of micro-ecological status of intestine of children with functional dyspepsia using non-invasive techniques and including analysis of species profile, associative potential, communicative capacities of bifidobacteria complements complex of diagnostic criteria, permits to develop prognostic markers and to determine parameters of following therapy of functional dyspepsia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd26","authors":["Rakova, E B","Nemichenko, U M","Popkova, S M","Serdyuk, L V","Dolgikh, V V","Ivanova, E I","Savelkaeva, M V"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-05T11:27:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0869-2084"],"issue":"10","journal":"Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika","last_mentioned_on":1454671573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26841674?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26841674","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"[THE SPECIES CHARACTERISTIC OF BIFIDOBACTERIA IN INTESTINAL BIOTOPE OF CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL DYSPEPSIA].","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/species-characteristic-bifidobacteria-intestinal-biotope-children-functional-dyspepsia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":5327376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":991950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319351,"mean":9.4318917300764,"rank":220656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319351,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":0.60220588235294,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MicrobiomePaper\/statuses\/695569110705401856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5095897],"posted_on":"2016-02-05T11:26:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Microbiome Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585212126173732865\/jEvg1KpB_normal.jpg","description":"The latest PubMed publications on Microbiome Research delivered direct to your Twitter Feed.
