Here we investigate the accuracy of existing rapid qualitative and semi-quantitative tests as compared with a quantitative reference test to assess their potential for use in remote tropical settings.\nBlood samples were obtained from consecutive patients recruited to a prospective fever study at three sites in rural Laos. At each site, one of three rapid qualitative or semi-quantitative tests was performed, as well as a corresponding quantitative NycoCard Reader II as a reference test. We estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the three tests against a threshold of 10\u00a0mg\/L and kappa values for the agreement of the two semi-quantitative tests with the results of the reference test.\nAll three tests showed high sensitivity, specificity and kappa values as compared with the NycoCard Reader II. With a threshold of 10\u00a0mg\/L the sensitivity of the tests ranged from 87-98 % and the specificity from 91-98 %. The weighted kappa values for the semi-quantitative tests were 0.7 and 0.8.\nThe use of CRP rapid tests could offer an inexpensive and effective approach to improve the targeting of antibiotics in remote settings where health facilities are basic and laboratories are absent. This study demonstrates that accurate CRP rapid tests are commercially available; evaluations of their clinical impact and cost-effectiveness at point of care is warranted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Koukeo Phommasone","Thomas Althaus","Phonesavanh Souvanthong","Khansoudaphone Phakhounthong","Laxoy Soyvienvong","Phatthaphone Malapheth","Mayfong Mayxay","Rebecca L Pavlicek","Daniel H Paris","David Dance","Paul Newton","Yoel Lubell","Rebecca L.
