When the lead follicle reached preovulatory status according to cycle day, ultrasound, and E2 levels, 0.25\u00a0mg of the GnRH antagonist ganirelix acetate was administered along with 200 IU of hCG. These medications were repeated daily for 2 to 3\u00a0days with further serial monitoring. A trigger dose of 10,000 IU of hCG was followed by follicle aspiration, IVF, and ET in a standard manner.\nFollicle maturity, live births, documentation of the feasibility of this new approach.\nIn all cases, E2 levels rose and the dominant follicle continued to increase in size in response to low-dose hCG after GnRH antagonist administration. Follicle aspiration yielded one or more mature oocytes. In\u00a0vitro fertilization and ET resulted in live births.\nLow-dose hCG can be used to complete follicle maturity in a natural cycle without the need for antecedent exogenous FSH stimulation. This finding may have strong clinical utility in modified natural cycle IVF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Richard J. Paulson","Karine Chung","Alexander M. Quaas","Sara J.
