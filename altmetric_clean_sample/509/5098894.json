Nearly 6% of the patients were readmitted within 30 days; more than half of whom were rehospitalized within 10 days. Adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics, patients had 8% higher odds of 30-day readmission and 12% higher odds of 10-day readmission, for each additional patient per nurse. Patients cared for in the best work environments had 12% lower odds of 30-day readmission.\nReadmission outcomes following major joint replacement are associated with hospital nursing care. Attention to nurse work conditions may be central to improving readmissions in this postoperative Medicare population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b11","authors":["Lasater, Karen B","McHugh, Matthew D","Karen B.
