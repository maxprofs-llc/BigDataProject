Several chronic pain syndromes and mood disorders are comorbid with migraine. In this study we examine the relationship of migraine-associated CA with these comorbid conditions. We also evaluate the association of CA with factors such as demographic profiles, migraine characteristics, and smoking status that may have an influence on the relationships of CA to pain and mood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b5","authors":["Tietjen GE","Brandes JL","Peterlin BL","Eloff A","Dafer RM","Stein MR","Drexler E","Martin VT","Hutchinson S","Aurora SK","Recober A","Herial NA","Utley C","White L","Khuder SA","Gretchen E.
