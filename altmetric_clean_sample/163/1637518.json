One of the concerns prior to the SIF's opening was that the facility might lead to a migration of drug activity and an increase in drug-related crime. Therefore, we examined crime rates in the neighborhood where the SIF is located in the year before versus the year after the SIF opened. No increases were seen with respect to drug trafficking (124 vs. 116) or assaults\/robbery (174 vs. 180), although a decline in vehicle break-ins\/vehicle theft was observed (302 vs. 227). The SIF was not associated with increased drug trafficking or crimes commonly linked to drug use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000089d","authors":["Wood E","Tyndall MW","Lai C","Montaner JS","Kerr T","Evan Wood","Mark W Tyndall","Calvin Lai","Julio SG Montaner","Thomas Kerr"],"doi":"10.1186\/1747-597x-1-13","first_seen_on":"2013-07-20T18:43:59+00:00","issns":["","1747-597X","1747597X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1505604499,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16722550","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1471778\/","http:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1747-597X-1-13","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1471778\/","https:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1747-597X-1-13"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1747-597X-1-13?site=substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC1471778","pmid":"16722550","pubdate":"2006-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Policy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Impact of a medically supervised safer injecting facility on drug dealing and other drug-related crime.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/substanceabusepolicy.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1747-597X-1-13","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-medically-supervised-safer-injecting-facility-drug-dealing-other-drugrelated-crime"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46.3,"score_history":{"1y":12.7,"6m":11.7,"3m":4.7,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422914,"mean":7.0864000630097,"rank":204716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8218114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422914,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128442,"mean":7.1483753007219,"rank":3698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":124742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128442,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":6.9297943925234,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":9.9568888888889,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":10,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
