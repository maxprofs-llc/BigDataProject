In this study, we modeled the monetized damages associated with 407 coal-fired power plants in the United States, focusing on premature mortality from fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). We applied a reduced-form chemistry-transport model accounting for primary PM(2.5) emissions and the influence of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emissions on secondary particulate formation. Outputs were linked with a concentration-response function for PM(2.5)-related mortality that incorporated nonlinearities and model uncertainty. We valued mortality with a value of statistical life approach, characterizing and propagating uncertainties in all model elements. At the median of the plant-specific uncertainty distributions, damages across plants ranged from $30,000 to $500,000 per ton of PM(2.5), $6,000 to $50,000 per ton of SO(2), $500 to $15,000 per ton of NO(x), and $0.02 to $1.57 per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Variability in damages per ton of emissions was almost entirely explained by population exposure per unit emissions (intake fraction), which itself was related to atmospheric conditions and the population size at various distances from the power plant. Variability in damages per kilowatt-hour was highly correlated with SO(2) emissions, related to fuel and control technology characteristics, but was also correlated with atmospheric conditions and population size at various distances. Our findings emphasize that control strategies that consider variability in damages across facilities would yield more efficient outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5663cf058f610004aba","authors":["Levy, Jonathan I.","Baxter, Lisa K.","Schwartz, Joel"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x","endpage":"1014","first_seen_on":"2013-07-19T18:15:21+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1539-6924","0272-4332","15396924","02724332"],"issue":"7","journal":"Risk Analysis: An International Journal","last_mentioned_on":1502910409,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x\/abstract;jsessionid=9C8B40EE97633AE6256D0E8119608E33.f04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x\/pdf","pmid":"19392676","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1000","subjects":["statisticsastopic"],"title":"Uncertainty and Variability in Health\u2010Related Damages from Coal\u2010Fired Power Plants in the United States","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1539-6924.2009.01227.x","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uncertainty-variability-healthrelated-damages-coalfired-power-plants-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24,"score_history":{"1y":3.2,"6m":3.2,"3m":3.2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":371985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8011894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127905,"mean":7.1204591725045,"rank":6650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":121210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127905,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1354,"mean":9.4644375461936,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1354,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":7.672,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
