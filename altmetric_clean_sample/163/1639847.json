One of these subpopulations expresses a B-cell marker, CD20. In a small pilot trial, we showed that a subset of Stage IV melanoma patients may potentially benefit from an adjuvant treatment using the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"536246132a83ee225b8b4590","authors":["Margarita Maurer","Rajasekharan Somasundaram","Meenhard Herlyn","Stephan N.
