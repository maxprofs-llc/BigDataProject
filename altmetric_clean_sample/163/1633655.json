In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insulin\/IGF signaling regulates adult longevity. We found that mutation of chico extends fruit fly median life-span by up to 48% in homozygotes and 36% in heterozygotes. Extension of life-span was not a result of impaired oogenesis in chico females, nor was it consistently correlated with increased stress resistance. The dwarf phenotype of chico homozygotes was also unnecessary for extension of life-span. The role of insulin\/IGF signaling in regulating animal aging is therefore evolutionarily conserved.","ads_id":"2001Sci...292..104C","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["David J.
