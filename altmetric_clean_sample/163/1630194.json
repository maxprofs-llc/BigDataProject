While reviewers position the text as the site of a subversive politics and a specifically sexualized form of affect, much of the affective power of Wetlands lies less in its treatment of sex than in its largely ignored descriptions of the revolting body. Via an analysis of the different forms of affect in operation within Wetlands, this article will explore whether the association of sex with politically charged subversion may now be subsiding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013fa","authors":["Hester H","Helen Hester"],"doi":"10.1080\/10894160.2013.731862","endpage":"252","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T10:08:45+00:00","issns":["1540-3548","1089-4160"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Journal of Lesbian Studies","last_mentioned_on":1394746689,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23855938?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23855938?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23855938","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"startpage":"240","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Rethinking Transgression: Disgust, Affect, and Sexuality in Charlotte Roche's Wetlands.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10894160.2013.731862","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rethinking-transgression-disgust-affect-sexuality-charlotte-roches-wetlands"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81022,"mean":7.9474901075031,"rank":55626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81022,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.6442477876106,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8857142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
