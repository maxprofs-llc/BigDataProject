A reflection of the emotional attention capture is the increased Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) for pleasant and unpleasant compared to neutral images (approximately 150-300 ms poststimulus). The present study explored whether this early emotion discrimination reflects an automatic phenomenon or is subject to interference by competing processing demands. Thus, emotional processing was assessed while participants performed a concurrent feature-based attention task varying in processing demands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","authors":["Harald T Schupp","Jessica Stockburger","Florian Bublatzky","Markus Jungh\u00f6fer","Almut I Weike","Alfons O Hamm"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-8-16","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T17:16:42+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1374081379,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1808466\/"],"pmcid":"PMC1808466","pmid":"17316444","pubdate":"2013-07-17T20:07:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"16","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Explicit attention interferes with selective emotion processing in human extrastriate cortex","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/explicit-attention-interferes-selective-emotion-processing-human-extrastriate-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2015209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76716,"mean":7.7563383432186,"rank":40423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":20659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76716,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":568,"mean":2.6616825396825,"rank":312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":568,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.5166060606061,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
