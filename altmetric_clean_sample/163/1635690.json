However, the mechanisms by which lipid metabolic disorders affect the development of RCC remain unclear and highly controversial. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine\/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. In the present study, the effect of free fatty acids in the promotion of RCC progression was investigated by upregulating ILK. Results of the MTT assay indicated that treatment of 786-O cells with oleic acid induced a concentration-dependent increase in cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the effect of oleic acid on cell apoptosis was not significant. Following treatment with oleic acid, the expression of ILK, phospho-Akt and G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) was increased in 786-O cells. These effects were reversed when the expression of ILK was downregulated using specific small interfering RNA. These results indicate that free fatty acids are associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma via activation of the GPR40\/ILK\/Akt pathway, revealing a novel mechanism for the correlation between metabolic disturbance and renal carcinoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837d","authors":["ZHENHUA LIU","YUNBEI XIAO","YEQING YUAN","XIAOWEI ZHANG","CAIPENG QIN","JING XIE","YICHANG HAO","TAO XU","XIAOFENG WANG"],"doi":"10.3892\/ol.2013.1160","first_seen_on":"2013-07-19T16:38:58+00:00","issns":["1792-1074"],"issue":"4","journal":"Oncology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1374251895,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3629253\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3629253","pmid":"23599801","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","startpage":"1395","title":"Effects of oleic acid on cell proliferation through an integrin-linked kinase signaling pathway in 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-oleic-acid-cell-proliferation-through-integrinlinked-kinase-signaling-pathway-786o-renal-cel-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2907492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":72836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85427,"mean":7.4164890548545,"rank":68325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85427,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":5.5832840236686,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.41071428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
