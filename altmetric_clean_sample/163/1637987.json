Repeated long-duration exposure to cold\/dry air at high minute ventilation rates can cause airway damage. Competition or training at venues close to busy roadways, or in indoor ice arenas or chlorinated swimming pools, harbors a risk for acute and chronic airway disorders from high pollutant exposure. This article discusses the effects of these harsh environments on the airways, and summarizes potential mechanisms and prevalence of airway disorders in elite athletes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005975","authors":["Rundell KW","Sue-Chu M","Kenneth W.
