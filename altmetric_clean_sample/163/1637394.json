Using a natural experiment approach, I found significant increases in Pap tests and clinical breast examinations among women eligible for services under the expansions but no significant change in HIV testing or routine doctor check-ups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Laura R.
