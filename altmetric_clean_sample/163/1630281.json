The AgNW-graphene hybrid TCE exhibited excellent optical and electrical properties as well as mechanical flexibility. The AgNW-graphene hybrid TCE showed highly enhanced thermal oxidation and chemical stabilities because of the superior gas-barrier property of the graphene protection layer. Furthermore, the organic solar cells with the AgNW-graphene hybrid TCE showed excellent photovoltaic performance as well as superior long-term stability under ambient conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Donghwa Lee","Hyungjin Lee","Yumi Ahn","Youngjun Jeong","Dae-Young Lee","Youngu Lee"],"doi":"10.1039\/c3nr02320f","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T10:29:44+00:00","issns":["2040-3372","2040-3364"],"issue":"17","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1374056733,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2013\/NR\/C3NR02320F"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2013\/nr\/c3nr02320f","pmid":"23842732","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"7750","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Highly stable and flexible silver nanowire\u00e2\u0080\u0093graphene hybrid transparent conducting electrodes for emerging optoelectronic devices","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-stable-flexible-silver-nanowiregraphene-hybrid-transparent-conducting-electrodes-emerging-opt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3070451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":947296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81022,"mean":7.9475259006925,"rank":55631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81022,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1388,"mean":3.1552170151406,"rank":684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1388,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.25,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
