This is true broadly and within the U.S. military veteran population, which is our focus. To increase funding for treatment, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) has implemented several initiatives over the past decade to direct funds toward SUD treatment, supplementing the unrestricted funds VA medical centers receive. We study the 'flypaper effect' or the extent to which these directed funds have actually increased SUD treatment spending.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000834","authors":["Austin B Frakt","Jodie Trafton","Amy Wallace","Matthew Neuman","Steven Pizer"],"doi":"10.1186\/1748-5908-8-79","first_seen_on":"2013-07-18T16:00:56+00:00","issns":["1748-5908"],"issue":"1","journal":"Implementation Science","last_mentioned_on":1506276189,"links":["http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/8\/1\/79\/abstract","https:\/\/implementationscience.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1748-5908-8-79"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/pdf\/1748-5908-8-79.pdf","pmid":"23866119","pubdate":"2013-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"79","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Directed funding to address under-provision of treatment for substance use disorders: A quantitative study","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/directed-funding-address-underprovision-treatment-substance-disorders-quantitative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.9,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":4.45,"3m":4.45,"1m":4.45,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1323361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7131218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128154,"mean":7.1482750462339,"rank":20819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":107288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128154,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":10.668772937905,"rank":431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":8.1237058823529,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":7},"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ImplementSci\/status\/358128702439178240","license":"public","citation_ids":[1633312],"posted_on":"2013-07-19T07:38:31+00:00","author":{"name":"ImpSci","url":"http:\/\/implementationscience.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1170835925\/ImplementationScience_normal.png","description":"Journal for the scientific study of methods to promote the uptake of research findings into routine healthcare in both clinical and policy contexts.","id_on_source":"ImplementSci","tweeter_id":"217451586","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2844},"tweet_id":"358128702439178240"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LizHoffmanbmc\/statuses\/359316986976669697","license":"public","citation_ids":[1633312],"posted_on":"2013-07-22T14:20:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Liz Hoffman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1923084945\/Liz_H_normal.JPG","description":"I'm a Journal Development Manager at BioMed Central working on health services research and policy.
