However, validated immunoassay kits to test this specificity have not been commercially available. SSc autoantibodies are basically mutually exclusive and are associated with a certain subset of the disease and\/or with organ involvement. Anti-Th\/To are generally considered to be markers of the limited cutaneous type of SSc with the involvement of certain internal organs. The excellent correlation between anti-Rpp25 as detected by their novel chemiluminescent method and anti-Th\/To as detected by immunoprecipitation suggest that the new assays may become widely available tests for clinicians in future and could help to clarify the clinical significance of anti-Th\/To in SSc as well as other conditions over different races or countries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","doi":"10.1186\/ar4241","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T10:24:16+00:00","issns":["1478-6362"],"issue":"4","journal":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1374056103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23856077?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23856077","pubdate":"2013-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"What autoantibody tests should become widely available to help scleroderma diagnosis and management?","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autoantibody-tests-become-widely-available-help-scleroderma-diagnosis-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2304454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1595196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81021,"mean":7.9475277215504,"rank":40903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":28244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81021,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":3.288422613531,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":4.0708333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
