In the present study, the Youth Actuarial Risk Assessment Tool (Y-ARAT) was developed for juvenile offenders based solely on police records, with the aim to estimate the risk of general recidivism among large groups of juvenile offenders by police officers without clinical expertise. On the basis of the Y-ARAT, juvenile offenders are classified into five risk groups based on (combinations of) 10 variables including different types of incidents in which the juvenile was a suspect, total number of incidents in which the juvenile was a suspect, total number of other incidents, total number of incidents in which co-occupants at the youth's address were suspects, gender, and age at first incident. The Y-ARAT was developed on a sample of 2,501 juvenile offenders and validated on another sample of 2,499 juvenile offenders, showing moderate predictive accuracy (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve = .73), with little variation between the construction and validation sample. The predictive accuracy of the Y-ARAT was considered sufficient to justify its use as a screening instrument for the police.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000233a","authors":["Claudia E. van der Put"],"doi":"10.1177\/1073191113495710","endpage":"351","first_seen_on":"2013-07-21T19:04:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1552-3489","1073-1911"],"issue":"3","journal":"Assessment","last_mentioned_on":1374447753,"links":["http:\/\/asm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/07\/08\/1073191113495710.abstract","http:\/\/asm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/07\/08\/1073191113495710.abstract?utm_campaign=G_ALL_T_2013&utm_medium=interest&utm_source=social_Twitter&utm_content=Visibility_and_reach_O&utm_term=Psychology"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/asm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/07\/08\/1073191113495710.full.pdf","pmid":"23838639","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"340","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Youth Actuarial Risk Assessment Tool (Y-ARAT): The Development of an Actuarial Risk Assessment Instrument for Predicting General Offense Recidivism on the Basis of Police Records","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/youth-actuarial-risk-assessment-tool-yarat-development-actuarial-risk-assessment-instrument-predicti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2177208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4046927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100724,"mean":7.6970536024543,"rank":33505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":67076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100724,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264,"mean":2.7535893536122,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.975,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
