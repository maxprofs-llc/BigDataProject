We investigated the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and daily n-3 fatty acid intake. This cross-sectional, community-based, epidemiologic study was conducted among 205 healthy postmenopausal women (mean age 63.5\u00a0years, range 46-79). We examined BMD, serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), urinary type-I collagen cross-linked-N-telopeptide (uNTX), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nutrient intake was calculated using a food-frequency questionnaire. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Simple regression analysis showed that intake of neither n-3 fatty acid nor n-6 fatty acid was associated with age or lipid metabolism indices. However, simple regression analysis showed that n-3 fatty acid intake was positively associated with both lumbar spine BMD and femoral neck BMD. n-6 fatty acid intake was positively associated with femoral neck BMD but not lumbar spine BMD. Multiple regression analysis showed that n-3 fatty acid intake was positively associated with lumbar spine BMD after adjustment for age, BMI, duration of menopausal state, grip strength, PINP, uNTX, and intakes of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K, and n-6 fatty acid. In conclusion, n-3 fatty acid intake was positively associated with lumbar spine BMD independent of bone resorption and serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in postmenopausal women.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002483","authors":["Nawata K","Yamauchi M","Takaoka S","Yamaguchi T","Sugimoto T"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00223-013-9743-5","first_seen_on":"2013-07-17T21:45:50+00:00","issns":["0171-967X"],"issue":"","journal":"Calcified Tissue International","last_mentioned_on":1374085324,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23708886?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23708886","pubdate":"2013-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Association of n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Intake with Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-n3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-intake-bone-mineral-density-postmenopausal-women-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724672,"mean":5.6964439640363,"rank":2489667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2212919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724672,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82758,"mean":8.1286554128352,"rank":41308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":40998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82758,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":383,"mean":3.1322513089005,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":383,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.745,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
