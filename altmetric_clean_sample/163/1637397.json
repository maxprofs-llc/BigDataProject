Since the global spread of MRSA in the 1960s, MRSA strains have evolved with increased pathogenic potential. Notably, some strains are now capable of causing persistent infections not only in hospitalized patients but also in healthy individuals in the community. Furthermore, MRSA is increasingly associated with infections among livestock-associated workers, primarily because of transmission from animals to humans. Moreover, many MRSA strains have gained resistance to most available antibiotics. In this review, we will present current knowledge on MRSA epidemiology and discuss new endeavors being undertaken to understand better the molecular and epidemiological underpinnings of MRSA outbreaks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf3","doi":"10.2147\/clep.s37071","first_seen_on":"2013-07-20T15:52:28+00:00","issns":["1179-1349"],"journal":"Clinical Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1388632863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23861600?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/improved-understanding-of-factors-driving-methicillin-resistant-staphy-peer-reviewed-article-CLEP","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3707418\/"],"pmid":"23861600","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Improved understanding of factors driving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemic waves.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-understanding-factors-driving-methicillinresistant-staphylococcus-aureus-epidemic-waves-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1008445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2928814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90529,"mean":7.5799407255216,"rank":24603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":64008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90529,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":3.8412121212121,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.5973684210526,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
