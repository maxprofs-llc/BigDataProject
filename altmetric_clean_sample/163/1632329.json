However, the neurocognitive processes that underlie online death-related thoughts remain unclear. Our recent functional MRI study found that the processing of linguistic cues related to death was characterized by decreased neural activity in human insular cortex. The current study further investigated the time course of neural processing of death-related linguistic cues. We recorded event-related potentials (ERP) to death-related, life-related, negative-valence, and neutral-valence words in a modified Stroop task that required color naming of words. We found that the amplitude of an early frontal\/central negativity at 84-120 ms (N1) decreased to death-related words but increased to life-related words relative to neutral-valence words. The N1 effect associated with death-related and life-related words was correlated respectively with individuals' pessimistic and optimistic attitudes toward life. Death-related words also increased the amplitude of a frontal\/central positivity at 124-300 ms (P2) and of a frontal\/central positivity at 300-500 ms (P3). However, the P2 and P3 modulations were observed for both death-related and negative-valence words but not for life-related words. The ERP results suggest an early inverse coding of linguistic cues related to life and death, which is followed by negative emotional responses to death-related information.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xi Liu","Zhenhao Shi","Yina Ma","Jungang Qin","Shihui Han"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0067905","first_seen_on":"2013-07-18T03:32:40+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1374118341,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3695929\/?report=classic"],"pmcid":"PMC3695929","pmid":"23840787","pubdate":"2013-07-18T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Dynamic Neural Processing of Linguistic Cues Related to Death","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-neural-processing-linguistic-cues-related-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94779,"mean":7.6857714659522,"rank":79078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94779,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88911,"mean":9.2651301540885,"rank":74705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88911,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3656,"mean":12.567637756498,"rank":3075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3656,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
