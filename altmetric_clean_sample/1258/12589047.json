We conclude that the hormone plays a very important role in maintaining the homogeneity of tissues and organs during the normal development of the human body or after an injury. Its effects on growth do not seem to take place during the fetal period or during the early infancy and are mediated by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) during childhood and puberty. In turn, IGF-I transcription is dependent on an adequate GH secretion, and in many tissues, it occurs independent of GH. We propose that GH may be a prohormone, rather than a hormone, since in many tissues and organs, it is proteolytically cleaved in a tissue-specific manner giving origin to shorter GH forms whose activity is still unknown.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003a8a","authors":["Jes","Cristina Almengl","Pablo Devesa","Jes\u00fas Devesa","Cristina Almengl\u00f3"],"doi":"10.4137\/cmed.s38201","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T04:57:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-5514"],"journal":"Clinical Medicine Insights: Endocrinology & Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1480985847,"links":["http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/multiple-effects-of-growth-hormone-in-the-body-is-it-really-the-hormon-article-a5964?source=rss&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/multiple-effects-of-growth-hormone-in-the-body-is-it-really-the-hormon-article-a5964","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5063841\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.la-press.com\/redirect_file.php?fileId=7919&filename=5964-CMED-Multiple-Effects-of-Growth-Hormone-in-the-Body:-Is-it-Really-the-Hormo.pdf&fileType=pdf","pmid":"27773998","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Libertas Academica","startpage":"47","title":"Multiple Effects of Growth Hormone in the Body: Is it Really the Hormone for Growth?","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-effects-growth-hormone-body-it-really-hormone-growth-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.75,"score_history":{"1y":19.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8021223,"mean":6.7870651379511,"rank":409358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7611070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8021223,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246484,"mean":12.581633621791,"rank":22825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":223624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246484,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.3825581395349,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2.5666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Neuroscience":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MY":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Does Intermittent Fasting Boost Your Metabolism?","url":"https:\/\/authoritynutrition.com\/intermittent-fasting-metabolism\/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AuthorityNutrition+%28Authority+Nutrition%29","license":"public","citation_ids":[9833246,2049066,3896298,4233514,4523572,10896821,175300,1899243,2490040,9865001,199416,4528388,10884151,6176977,9211758,108591,3025459,5445523,241347,3208774,558685,767209,12589047,3073502,176473,4276554,4547224,249100,14478918,652608,12654446,443551,1361464,7115061,218901,2501907,1663788,6363899,3578823,1553866,824714,14478922,723499,204439,4805277],"posted_on":"2016-11-20T10:00:00+00:00","summary":"Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves periods of food restriction (fasting) followed by normal eating.
