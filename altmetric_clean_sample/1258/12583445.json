However, the role of such molecules on mosquito vectorial capacity is unknown. Weather has been recognized as a major determinant of the spread of dengue, and plants under abiotic stress increase their production of polyphenols.\nHere, we show that including polyphenols in mosquito meals promoted the activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK positively regulated midgut autophagy leading to a decrease in bacterial proliferation and an increase in vector lifespan. Suppression of AMPK activity resulted in a 6-fold increase in midgut microbiota. Similarly, inhibition of polyphenol-induced autophagy induced an 8-fold increase in bacterial proliferation. Mosquitoes maintained on the polyphenol diet were readily infected by dengue virus.\nThe present findings uncover a new direct route by which exacerbation of autophagy through activation of the AMPK pathway leads to a more efficient control of mosquito midgut microbiota and increases the average mosquito lifespan. Our results suggest for the first time that the polyphenol content and availability of the surrounding vegetation may increase the population of mosquitoes prone to infection with arboviruses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e2","authors":["Rodrigo Dutra Nunes","Guilherme Ventura-Martins","D\u00e9bora Monteiro Moretti","Priscilla Medeiros-Castro","Carlucio Rocha-Santos","Carlos Renato de Oliveira Daumas-Filho","Paula Rego Barros Bittencourt-Cunha","Karina Martins-Cardoso","Cec\u00edlia Oliveira Cudischevitch","Rubem Figueiredo Sadok Menna-Barreto","Jos\u00e9 Henrique Maia Oliveira","Desiely Silva Gusm\u00e3o","Francisco Jos\u00e9 Alves Lemos","Daniela Sales Alviano","Pedro Lagerblad Oliveira","Carl Lowenberger","David Majerowicz","Ricardo Melo Oliveira","Rafael Dias Mesquita","Georgia Correa Atella","M\u00e1rio Alberto Cardoso Silva-Neto","Mary Ann McDowell"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005034","first_seen_on":"2016-10-12T19:02:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1935-2735"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1496857955,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosntds\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005034","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosntds\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0005034","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27732590?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosntds\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005034.PDF","pmid":"27732590","pubdate":"2016-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"e0005034","title":"Polyphenol-Rich Diets Exacerbate AMPK-Mediated Autophagy, Decreasing Proliferation of Mosquito Midgut Microbiota, and Extending Vector Lifespan","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyphenolrich-diets-exacerbate-ampkmediated-autophagy-decreasing-proliferation-mosquito-midgut-micr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1955228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6362563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250840,"mean":12.683654814442,"rank":78741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":171404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250840,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504,"mean":11.115130357539,"rank":1957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":18.24222826087,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
