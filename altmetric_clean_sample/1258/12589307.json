Toxic effects of H. pylori components have been assessed in an association with damage to cell nuclei and inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation.\nWe showed that H. pylori GE, CagA and UreA promoted regeneration of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which is necessary for effective tissue healing. However, in vivo increased proliferative activity of these cells may constitute an increased risk of gastric neoplasia. In contrast, H. pylori LPS showed a dose-dependent influence on the process of wound healing. At a low concentration (1 ng\/mL) H. pylori LPS accelerated of healing epithelial cells, which was linked to significantly enhanced cell proliferation and MTT reduction as well as lack of alterations in cell cycle and downregulation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) production as well as cell nuclei destruction. By comparison, H. pylori LPS at a high concentration (25 ng\/mL) inhibited the process of wound repair, which was related to diminished proliferative activity of the cells, cell cycle arrest, destruction of cell nuclei and downregulation of the EGF\/STAT3 signalling pathway.\nIn vivo H. pylori LPS driven effects might lead to the maintenance of chronic inflammatory response and pathological disorders on the level of the gastric mucosal barrier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["Mnich, Eliza","Kowalewicz-Kulbat, Magdalena","Sici\u0144ska, Paulina","Hinc, Krzysztof","Obuchowski, Micha\u0142","Gajewski, Adrian","Moran, Anthony P","Chmiela, Magdalena"],"doi":"10.3748\/wjg.v22.i33.7536","first_seen_on":"2016-10-13T05:15:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2219-2840","1007-9327"],"issue":"33","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1481606626,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27672275"],"pmid":"27672275","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"7536","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"\n              Impact of\n              Helicobacter pylori\n              on the healing process of the gastric barrier\n            ","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-ihelicobacter-pylorii-healing-process-gastric-barrier"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244442,"mean":12.493263429621,"rank":202167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244442,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3542,"mean":2.9128788477831,"rank":2446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3542,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
