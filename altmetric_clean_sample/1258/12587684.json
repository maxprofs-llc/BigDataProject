Trypanothione reductase (TryR) is the key enzyme to develop this disease. Though this enzyme is well thought-out as potential drug target, the accurate structure of enzyme-inhibitor complex is required to design a potential inhibitor which is less available for TryR. In this research, we aimed to investigate the advanced drug over the available existing drugs by designing inhibitors as well as to identify a new enzyme-inhibitor complex that may act as a template for drug design. A set of analogues were designed from a known inhibitor Quinacrine Mustard (QUM) to identify the effective inhibitor against this enzyme. Further, the pharmacoinformatics elucidation and structural properties of designed inhibitor proposed effective drug candidates against Chagas disease. Molecular docking study suggests that a designed inhibitor has higher binding affinity in both crystal and modeled TryR and also poses similar interacting residues as of crystal TryR-QUM complex structure. The comparative studies based on in silico prediction proposed an enzyme-inhibitor complex which could be effective to control the disease activity. So our in silico analysis based on TryR built model, Pharmacophore and docking analysis might play an important role for the development of novel therapy for Chagas disease. But both animal model experiments and clinical trials must be done to confirm the efficacy of the therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025ca","authors":["Mohammad Uzzal Hossain","Arafat Rahman Oany","Shah Adil Ishtiyaq Ahmad","Md.
