Defined cis-regulatory elements from rodent Insulin genes have permitted genetic labeling of human islet \u03b2-cells, enabling lineage tracing and generation of human \u03b2-cell lines, but analogous elements for genetically labeling human \u03b1-cells with high specificity do not yet exist. To identify genetic elements that specifically direct reporter expression to human \u03b1-cells, we investigated noncoding sequences adjacent to the human GLUCAGON and ARX genes, which are expressed in islet \u03b1-cells. Elements with high evolutionary conservation were cloned into lentiviral vectors to direct fluorescent reporter expression in primary human islets. Based on the specificity of reporter expression for \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells, we found that rat glucagon promoter was not specific for human \u03b1-cells but that addition of human GLUCAGON untranslated region sequences substantially enhanced specificity of labeling in both cultured and transplanted islets to a degree not previously reported, to our knowledge. Specific transgene expression from these cis-regulatory sequences in human \u03b1-cells should enable targeted genetic modification and lineage tracing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e5","authors":["Philip T.
