A comprehensive work analysis using objective and subjective methods was performed to determine the present work situation in preschools in Germany, and the results were used to derive suitable intervention measures. The musculoskeletal strain was determined by means of a comprehensive analysis of postures, forces and movements using the CUELA system and calculated as cumulative shift workloads. The intervention measures were evaluated in a pre- and post-intervention assessment for 12 participants. Significant alterations in the duration of postures were determined, specifically for the daily duration of knee-straining postures as well as the degree of trunk flexion between 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, which were reduced from 8.4% to 3.1% and from 3.7% to 2.4% respectively, following the intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001232","authors":["Burford, Eva-Maria","Ellegast, Rolf","Weber, Britta","Brehmen, Manuela","Groneberg, David","Sinn-Behrendt, Andrea","Bruder, Ralph"],"doi":"10.1080\/00140139.2017.1340673","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T07:35:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0014-0139","1366-5847"],"journal":"Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1500019123,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/00140139.2017.1340673"],"pmid":"28629265","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The comparative analysis of postural and biomechanical parameters of preschool teachers pre- and post-intervention within the ErgoKiTa study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-analysis-postural-biomechanical-parameters-preschool-teachers-pre-postintervention-withi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":4361523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2279410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178960,"mean":11.460632971798,"rank":97960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178960,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1267,"mean":4.5182353870458,"rank":934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1267,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.5166666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
