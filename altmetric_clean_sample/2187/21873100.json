Patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (n\u2009=\u2009604; 30.7%) were older, more likely to be women, to have hypertension, diabetes, prior MI or PCI, with higher severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), but were less frequently smokers or presenting with stable CAD. After adjustment, the 2-year rates of primary endpoint (composite of death, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident), as well as bleeding and net adverse clinical events were higher in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. DAPT prolongation at 24-month did not reduce the primary endpoint in both CKD (adj. HR: 0.957; 95% CI 0.652-1.407; P\u2009=\u20090.825) and no-CKD (adj. HR: 1.341; 95% CI 0.861-2.086; P\u2009=\u20090.194) groups (Pint\u2009=\u20090.249), but increased bleeding in both groups (CKD: adj. HR: 1.999; 95% CI 1.100-3.632; P\u2009=\u20090.023; no-CKD: adj. HR: 2.880; 95% CI 1.558-5.326; P\u2009=\u20090.001; Pint\u2009=\u20090.407).\nModerate-to-severe CKD did not modify the effect of a prolonged or shortened DAPT duration in largely unselected patients undergoing stent implantation. Our analysis suggests that CKD should not be a major driver in the decision-making on the duration of DAPT after stent implantation. This exploratory study is underpowered and should be considered hypothesis-generating only. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e05","authors":["Giuseppe Gargiulo","Andrea Santucci","Raffaele Piccolo","Anna Franzone","Sara Ariotti","Andrea Baldo","Giovanni Esposito","Aris Moschovitis","Stephan Windecker","Marco Valgimigli"],"doi":"10.1002\/ccd.26921","first_seen_on":"2017-07-14T05:26:34+00:00","issns":["15221946"],"journal":"Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (Formerly Catheterization and Cardiovascular Diagnosis)","last_mentioned_on":1500009981,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28198091"],"pmid":"28198091","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Impact of chronic kidney disease on 2-year clinical outcomes in patients treated with 6-month or 24-month DAPT duration: An analysis from the PRODIGY trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-chronic-kidney-disease-2year-clinical-outcomes-patients-treated-6month-24month-dapt-duration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8208063,"mean":6.9506291146371,"rank":7102929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8208063,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178949,"mean":11.46133299059,"rank":145965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178949,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1228,"mean":2.1353186634067,"rank":707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1228,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":3.835,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
