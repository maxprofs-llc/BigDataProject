Yet, very little is known about the role of workplace ostracism in generating nurses' silence.\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted in a public hospital in Cyprus.\nData were collected from 157 nurses employed in a public hospital of Cyprus between November 2014-January 2015. To examine the present hypotheses bootstrapping analysis and Sobel test were conducted.\nResults demonstrated that workplace ostracism has an effect on nurses' silence towards patient safety. Moreover, this effect was partially mediated through organizational identification.\nWorkplace ostracism among nurses significantly affects both nurses' attitude and behaviour namely organizational identification and employee silence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c66","authors":["Gkorezis, Panagiotis","Panagiotou, Maria","Theodorou, Mamas"],"doi":"10.1111\/jan.12992","endpage":"2388","first_seen_on":"2016-05-27T06:32:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2648"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Advanced Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1498798118,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jan.12992\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jan.12992"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jan.12992\/pdf","pmid":"27113971","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"2381","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Workplace ostracism and employee silence in nursing: the mediating role of organizational identification","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/workplace-ostracism-employee-silence-nursing-mediating-role-organizational-identification"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8452724,"mean":7.1046313702619,"rank":648084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7803267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8452724,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274144,"mean":11.673915934384,"rank":30432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":243617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274144,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2702,"mean":11.782330988523,"rank":557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2702,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":23.272043010753,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":15,"researcher":3,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":15,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
