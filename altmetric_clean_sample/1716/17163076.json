We demonstrate the application of miniaturized high-throughput experimentation methods to resolve synthetic chemistry challenges on the frontlines of a lead optimization effort to develop diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1) inhibitors. Reactions were performed on \u223c1 mg scale using glass microvials providing a miniaturized high-throughput experimentation capability that was used to study a challenging SNAr reaction. The availability of robust synthetic chemistry conditions discovered in these miniaturized investigations enabled the development of structure-activity relationships that ultimately led to the discovery of soluble, selective, and potent inhibitors of DGAT1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Tim Cernak","Nathan J.
