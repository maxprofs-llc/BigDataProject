In 178 patients (67.9%) who presented dizziness after BPPV recovery at the follow-up visit, 94 patients underwent CRP (treated group) and 84 did not (non-treated group). A subjective evaluation of vertigo was made by way of a questionnaire. The rates of recurrence of BPPV and residual dizziness were statistically compared between the treated and the non-treated groups; survival analysis was carried out as well.\nIn an observational period ranging from 1 to 6years, BPPV recurred in 122 subjects (46.6%) of the investigated population. Among the patients with residual dizziness, the difference in rate of recurrence of BPPV between the treated group and the non-treated group was not statistically significant (p=0.84). The treated group presented a significantly higher rate of recovery from dizziness compared to the non-treated group (p<0.001).\nA repeated CRP in patients with post-CRP dizziness increased the rate of recovery from dizziness but had no influence on BBPV recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Giancarlo Tirelli","Luca Nicastro","Annalisa Gatto","Margherita Tofanelli"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjoto.2016.09.009","first_seen_on":"2017-03-09T13:46:43+00:00","issns":["01960709"],"journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1489067190,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=27806891","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.amjoto.2016.09.009"],"pmid":"27806891","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Repeated canalith repositioning procedure in BPPV: Effects on recurrence and dizziness prevention","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0196070916301636","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repeated-canalith-repositioning-procedure-bppv-effects-recurrence-dizziness-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":4196726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3920686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242350,"mean":13.667776570153,"rank":127526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":104866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242350,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":465,"mean":1.8291896551724,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":465,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.57619047619048,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":4,"Unspecified":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VPTA_Tweets\/statuses\/839834785417658369","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17162975],"posted_on":"2017-03-09T13:46:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Virginia PT Assoc.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/579354393587421184\/BMNZ4ySU_normal.jpg","description":"The Official Twitter for the Virginia component of @APTAtweets","id_on_source":"VPTA_Tweets","tweeter_id":"3102088689","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"839834785417658369"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Repeated canalith repositioning procedure in BPPV: Effects on recurrence and dizziness prevention. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154326776576985&id=185229251984","license":"public","citation_ids":[17162975,17162975],"posted_on":"2017-03-09T13:46:15+00:00","summary":"Canalith repositioning procedure in BPPV.
