This study assessed whether lower doses were less effective than the approved 20-mg TID dosage.\nTreatment-naive patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were randomized to 12\u00a0weeks of double-blind sildenafil 1, 5, or 20\u00a0mg TID; 12\u00a0weeks of open-label sildenafil 20\u00a0mg TID followed. Changes from baseline in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) for sildenafil 1 or 5\u00a0mg versus 20\u00a0mg TID were compared using a Williams test. Hemodynamics, functional class, and biomarkers were assessed.\nThe study was prematurely terminated for non-safety reasons, with 129 of 219 planned patients treated. At week 12, 6MWD change from baseline was significantly greater for sildenafil 20 versus 1\u00a0mg (P\u2009=\u20090.011) but not versus 5\u00a0mg. At week 24, 6MWD increases from baseline were larger in those initially randomized to 20 versus 5 or 1\u00a0mg (74 vs 50 and 47\u00a0m, respectively). At week 12, changes in hemodynamic parameters were generally small and variable between treatment groups; odds ratios for improvement in functional class were not statistically significantly different. Improvements in B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly greater with sildenafil 20 versus 1 but not 5\u00a0mg.\nSildenafil 20\u00a0mg TID appeared to be more effective than 1\u00a0mg TID for improving 6MWD; sildenafil 5\u00a0mg TID appeared to have similar clinical and hemodynamic effects as 20\u00a0mg TID.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT00430716 (Registration date: January 31, 2007).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d9","authors":["Carmine Dario Vizza","B.
