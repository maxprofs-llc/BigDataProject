HCPs were recruited from six general practices and one walk-in centre, serving a mix of deprived and affluent areas.\nInterviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, imported into NVivo 9, and analysed thematically.\nHCPs varied in the symptom and clinical examination findings used to identify children they thought might benefit from antibiotics. Their diagnostic reasoning and assessment of perceived clinical need for antibiotics used a dual process, combining an initial rapid assessment with subsequent detailed deductive reasoning. HCPs reported confidence diagnosing and managing most minor and severe RTIs. However, residual prognostic uncertainty, particularly for the intermediate illness severity group, frequently led to antibiotic prescribing to mitigate the perceived risk of subsequent illness deterioration. Some HCPs perceived a need for more paediatrics training to aid treatment decisions. The study also identified a number of non-clinical factors influencing prescribing.\nPrognostic uncertainty remains an important driver of HCPs' antibiotic prescribing. Experience and training in recognising severe RTIs, together with more evidence to help HCPs identify the children at risk of future illness deterioration, may support HCPs' identification of the children most and least likely to benefit from antibiotics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d12","authors":["Horwood, Jeremy","Cabral, Christie","Hay, Alastair D","Ingram, Jenny","Jeremy Horwood","Christie Cabral","Alastair D Hay","Jenny Ingram"],"doi":"10.3399\/bjgp16x683821","endpage":"e213","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T11:24:21+00:00","funders":["niehs","dohuk"],"issns":["1478-5242","0960-1643"],"issue":"644","journal":"British Journal of General Practice","last_mentioned_on":1493813290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26852795?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/05\/bjgp16X683821","http:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/66\/644\/e207","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3399\/bjgp16X683821","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26852795","http:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/66\/644\/e207?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/bjgp\/66\/644\/e207.full.pdf","pmid":"26852795","pubdate":"2016-02-10T22:02:40+00:00","publisher":"British Journal of General Practice","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e207","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Primary care clinician antibiotic prescribing decisions in consultations for children with RTIs: a qualitative interview study.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-care-clinician-antibiotic-prescribing-decisions-consultations-children-rtis-qualitative-inte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":37.7,"score_history":{"1y":18.75,"6m":1.7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":37.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":233243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7916910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333666,"mean":9.8011685373049,"rank":14895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":318763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333666,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1897,"mean":10.068679324895,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1897,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":18.843421052632,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":17,"researcher":4,"practitioner":7,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":17,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":7,"Scientists":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
