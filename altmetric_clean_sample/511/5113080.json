Once in the extracellular space, HMGB1 can act as a danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP), thus stimulating or inhibiting certain functions of the immune system; depending on the \"combinatorial cocktail\" of the surrounding milieu. HMGB1 exerts its various functions through binding to a multitude of membrane-bound receptors such as TLR-2; -4 and -9; IL-1 and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products); partly complex-bound with intracellular fragments like nucleosomes. Soluble RAGE in the extracellular space, however, acts as a decoy receptor by binding to HMGB1 and inhibiting its effects. This review aims to outline today's knowledge of structure, intra- and extracellular functions including mechanisms of release and finally the clinical relevance of HMGB1 and RAGE as clinical biomarkers in therapy monitoring, prediction and prognosis of malignant and autoimmune disease.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f07","authors":["Pilzweger, Christin","Holdenrieder, Stefan"],"doi":"10.3390\/diagnostics5020219","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T11:23:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2075-4418"],"issue":"2","journal":"Diagnostics","last_mentioned_on":1455726415,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26854151?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26854151"],"pmid":"26854151","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Circulating HMGB1 and RAGE as Clinical Biomarkers in Malignant and Autoimmune Diseases.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-hmgb1-rage-clinical-biomarkers-malignant-autoimmune-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":3640737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2048811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321566,"mean":9.5764971934131,"rank":169449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":117047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321566,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":3.3549090909091,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":5.2344,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
