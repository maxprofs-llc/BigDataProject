The suspension format was based on the target proteins forming a sandwich structure between the magnetic beads and the quantum dot (QD) probes through specific antibody-antigen interactions. The planar microarray format was produced by fabricating an array of micro-wells in PDMS. Each micro-well was designed to trap a single microbead and eventually generated a microbead array within the PDMS chamber. The resultant bead-based on-chip assay could be used for simultaneously detecting three lung cancer biomarkers-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), fragments of cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA21-1) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-in 10\u03bcl of human serum, with a wide linear dynamic range (1.03-111ng\/mL for CEA and CYFRA21-1; 9.26-1000ng\/ml for NSE) and a low detection limit (CEA: 0.19ng\/ml; CYFRA21-1: 0.97ng\/ml; NSE: 0.37ng\/ml; S\/N=3). Our micro-well chip does not require complex e-beam lithography or the reactive ion etching process as with existing micro-well systems, which rely on expensive focused ion beam (FIB) milling or optical fiber bundles. Furthermore, the current approach is easy to operate without extra driving equipment such as pumps, and can make parallel detection for multiplexing with rapid binding kinetics, small reagent consumption and low cost. This work has demonstrated the importance of the successful application of on-chip multiplexing sandwich assays for the detection of biomarker proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Liu, Lifen","Wu, Simin","Jing, Fengxiang","Zhou, Hongbo","Jia, Chunping","Li, Gang","Cong, Hui","Jin, Qinghui","Zhao, Jianlong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2016.01.084","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T02:50:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4235"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1454986161,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S095656631630094X&_version=1&md5=e2c2f3e0555f12d3826c1aa51aafe07a"],"pmid":"26852198","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Bead-based microarray immunoassay for lung cancer biomarkers using quantum dots as labels.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beadbased-microarray-immunoassay-lung-cancer-biomarkers-using-quantum-dots-labels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":5378446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321013,"mean":9.5501848715933,"rank":222368,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":54877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321013,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1818,"mean":2.7530996147496,"rank":1038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1818,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":3.1527333333333,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
