Some of these loci, such as PTPN22, IL23R, and STAT4, are shared among different ADs, and the combination of risk loci may determine an individual's susceptibility for a disease. The majority of GWAS loci are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), where disease-causing variants regulate expression of neighboring (or sometimes distant) genes. Because the eQTL effects often are cell type-specific, the incorporation of epigenetic data from disease-related cell types and tissues is expected to refine the identification of causal variants. The cumulative eQTL effects in multiple genes may influence the activity or fate of immune cells, which in turn may affect the function of the immune system in individuals. In this paper, I review the etiology of ADs by focusing on important immune cells (Th1, Th17, and regulatory T-cells), important pathways (antigen receptor signaling and type I interferon signaling), and relevant genes identified in GWAS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0d","authors":["Yuta Kochi","Kochi, Yuta"],"doi":"10.1093\/intimm\/dxw002","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T04:05:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2377"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1460102744,"links":["http:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/07\/intimm.dxw002.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26857735?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26857735?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/07\/intimm.dxw002.abstract","https:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/dxw002v2?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/dxw002v2?rss=1&ssource=mfr&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/28\/4\/155?rss=1&ssource=mfr&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/intimm.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/02\/07\/intimm.dxw002.full.pdf","pmid":"26857735","pubdate":"2016-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"dxw002","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Genetics of autoimmune diseases; perspectives from genome-wide association studies.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetics-autoimmune-diseases-perspectives-genomewide-association-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":1660019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5848945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325632,"mean":9.6400940205321,"rank":88544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":236177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325632,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":520,"mean":2.2947129094412,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":520,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.1815789473684,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
