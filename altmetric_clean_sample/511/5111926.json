In 8 of 16 cases studied, intestinal biopsy revealed coeliac disease. Fourteen patients had occipital partial epilepsy with a relatively benign outcome, while 4 patients were affected by a severe form of epilepsy, with very frequent, drug-resistant, generalised and partial seizures with mental deterioration. One patient had a single episode of convulsive status epilepticus at four months of age. The neurological examination was normal in all patients. CT showed flocculo-nodular, cortico-subcortical BOC, without enhancement and without lobar or hemispheric atrophy. MRI was normal. The clinical and neuroimaging features of these patients are different therefore from those with the Sturge-Weber Syndrome. The study confirms a high prevalence of coliac disease in patients with BOC, but the relationship between these two pathologies still needs to be clarified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a5","authors":["A Magaudda","B Dalla Bernardina","P De Marco","Z Sfaello","M Longo","V Colamaria","O Daniele","G Tortorella","M A Tata","R Di Perri"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T05:54:55+00:00","issns":["0022-3050"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1453784620,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1015143\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1015143\/pdf\/jnnpsyc00481-0047.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1015143","pmid":"8350105","pubdate":"1993-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"885","subjects":["psychiatry","neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"Bilateral occipital calcification, epilepsy and coeliac disease: clinical and neuroimaging features of a new syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bilateral-occipital-calcification-epilepsy-coeliac-disease-clinical-neuroimaging-features-new-syndro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7047715,"mean":6.2650270246466,"rank":6057053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7047715,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319853,"mean":9.5148391943771,"rank":263404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319853,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3902,"mean":5.7400794668034,"rank":3384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3902,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":20.378744680851,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
