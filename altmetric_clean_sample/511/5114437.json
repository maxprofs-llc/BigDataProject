The hay-fed animals shed E. coli O157 longer than the grain-fed animals, and irrespective of diet, these bacteria were equally acid resistant. Feeding cattle hay may increase human infections with E. coli O157:H7.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Carolyn J. Hovde","Paula R. Austin","Karen A. Cloud","Christopher J.
