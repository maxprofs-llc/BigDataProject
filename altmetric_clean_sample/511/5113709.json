Here, we investigated the relationship between local synaptic excitation and global inhibition in hippocampal pyramidal neurons using functional dendrite imaging in combination with whole-cell recordings of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. We found that the sums of spine inputs over dendritic trees were counterbalanced by a proportional amount of somatic inhibitory inputs. This online E\/I correlation was maintained in dendritic segments that were longer than 50\u00a0\u03bcm. However, at the single spine level, only 22% of the active spines were activated with inhibitory inputs. This inhibition-coupled activity occurred mainly in the spines with large heads. These results shed light on a microscopic E\/I-balancing mechanism that operates at selected synapses and that may increase the accuracy of neural information.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Takahashi, Naoya","Kobayashi, Chiaki","Ishikawa, Tomoe","Ikegaya, Yuji","Naoya Takahashi","Chiaki Kobayashi","Tomoe Ishikawa","Yuji Ikegaya"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.celrep.2016.01.024","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T12:03:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2211-1247"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1479025940,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26854220?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/fulltext\/S2211-1247(16)00045-0","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/abstract\/S2211-1247(16)00045-0"],"pmid":"26854220","pubdate":"2016-02-10T22:02:13+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Subcellular Imbalances in Synaptic Activity.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcellular-imbalances-synaptic-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":1187265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6499162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":328592,"mean":9.65649982501,"rank":67351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":261004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":328592,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616,"mean":21.887331673582,"rank":1636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":24.24015282392,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
