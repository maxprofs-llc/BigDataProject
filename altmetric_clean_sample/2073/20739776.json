Healthy human subjects (n = 6) performed 5-min bouts of maximal rhythmic handgrip (RHG) before (CONTROL) and after prolonged (60-min) handgrip exercise (ATTEN-EX) designed to attenuate lactic acidosis in active muscle by partially depleting muscle glycogen. Concentrations of free intracellular phosphocreatine ([PCr]), adenosine triphosphate ([ATP]), and orthophosphate ([P(i)]) and pH were measured by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and used to calculate adenosine diphosphate [ADP], [H2PO4-], and [HPO4(2-)]. Handgrip force output was measured with a dynamometer, and fatigue was determined by loss of maximal contractile force. After ATTEN-EX, the normal exercise-induced muscle acidosis was reduced. At peak CONTROL RHG, pH fell to 6.3 +\/- 0.1 (SE) and muscle fatigue was correlated with [PCr] (r = 0.83), [P(i)] (r = 0.82), and [H2PO4-] (r = 0.81); [ADP] was 22.0 +\/- 5.7 mumol\/kg. At peak RHG after ATTEN-EX, pH was 6.9 +\/- 0.1 and [ADP] was 116.1 +\/- 18.2 mumol\/kg, although [PCr] and [P(i)] were not different from CONTROL RHG (P greater than 0.05). After ATTEN-EX, fatigue correlated most closely with [ADP] (r = 0.84). The data indicate that skeletal muscle fatigue 1) is multifactorial, 2) can occur without decreased pH or increased [H2PO4-], and 3) is correlated with [ADP] after exercise-induced glycogen depletion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Bertocci, L A","Fleckenstein, J L","Antonio, J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T23:36:22+00:00","issns":["8750-7587"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1496606571,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=Bertocci+Antonio"],"pmid":"1506402","pubdate":"1992-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Human muscle fatigue after glycogen depletion: a 31P magnetic resonance study.","type":"article","volume":"73"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3939026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4193571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241312,"mean":12.20822973673,"rank":111904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":122137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241312,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3538,"mean":10.074684195646,"rank":2087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3538,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":11.188486486486,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"TW":1,"CL":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JoseAntonioPhD\/statuses\/870061361346347008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20739776],"posted_on":"2017-05-31T23:36:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Jose Antonio PhD","url":"http:\/\/ISSN.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/525691559589969920\/agXsRZCM_normal.jpeg","description":"CEO of the #ISSN | Bruce Lee fan | avid paddler | prolific reader of thriller fiction | libertarian | sports nutrition science nerd | NSU http:\/\/www.nova.edu","id_on_source":"JoseAntonioPhD","tweeter_id":"28771821","geo":{"lt":28.75054,"ln":-82.5001,"country":"US"},"followers":11054},"tweet_id":"870061361346347008"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Artemis_taiwan\/statuses\/870472833549205504","license":"gnip","rt":["JoseAntonioPhD"],"citation_ids":[20739776],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T02:51:10+00:00","author":{"name":"\u66fe\u6021\u921e","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/728098899366281218\/RFuceVC6_normal.jpg","description":"Sports Dietitian","id_on_source":"Artemis_taiwan","tweeter_id":"704230950570295296","geo":{"lt":22.61626,"ln":120.31333,"country":"TW"},"followers":72},"tweet_id":"870472833549205504"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/profemonsalves\/statuses\/871456835819188224","license":"gnip","rt":["JoseAntonioPhD"],"citation_ids":[20739776],"posted_on":"2017-06-04T20:01:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Matias Monsalves A","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Matias_Monsalves-Alvarez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/853070284248801281\/naGrUJm1_normal.jpg","description":"MSc.
