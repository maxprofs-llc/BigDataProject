[Subjects and Methods] Fifteen children diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy were divided randomly into the balance training group and control group. The experimental group only received a multisensory dynamic balance training, while the control group performed general physiotherapy focused balance and muscle strengthening exercise based Neurodevelopmental treatment. Both groups had a therapy session for 30 minutes per day, three times a week for six weeks. The ultrasonographic muscle thickness were obtained in order to compare and analyze muscle thickness before and after in each group. [Result] The experimental group had significant increases in muscle thickness in the rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius muscles. The control group had significant increases in muscle thickness in the tibialis anterior. The test results of the rectus femoris, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius muscle thickness values between the groups showed significant differences. [Conclusion] In conclusion, a multisensory dynamic balance training can be recommended as a treatment method for patients with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Seung-min Nam","Won-hyo Kim","Chang-kyo Yun"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.29.775","first_seen_on":"2017-05-31T19:16:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0915-5287","2187-5626"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1496258160,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28533629"],"pmcid":"PMC5430292","pmid":"28533629","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"title":"The effects of a multisensory dynamic balance training on the thickness of lower limb muscles in ultrasonography in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-multisensory-dynamic-balance-training-thickness-lower-limb-muscles-ultrasonography-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":6294824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1122397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240201,"mean":12.039070258118,"rank":169327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240201,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":953,"mean":3.2826932773109,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":953,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.14,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
