To study the functional significance of these mutations, the activated Ki-ras genes in two human colon carcinoma cell lines, DLD-1 and HCT 116, were disrupted by homologous recombination. Compared with parental cells, cells disrupted at the activated Ki-ras gene were morphologically altered, lost the capacity for anchorage-independent growth, grew more slowly both in vitro and in nude mice, and showed reduced expression of c-myc. Thus, the activated Ki-ras gene plays a key role in colorectal tumorigenesis through altered cell differentiation and cell growth.","ads_id":"1993Sci...260...85S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["S Shirasawa","M Furuse","N Yokoyama","T Sasazuki"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.8465203","first_seen_on":"2017-09-30T17:07:40+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"5104","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1506791245,"links":["http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/260\/5104\/85.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/260\/5104\/85.full.pdf","pmid":"8465203","pubdate":"1993-04-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Altered growth of human colon cancer cell lines disrupted at activated Ki-ras","type":"article","volume":"260","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-growth-human-colon-cancer-cell-lines-disrupted-activated-kiras-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4523208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109281,"mean":11.340768539532,"rank":58151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":39632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109281,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41974,"mean":33.704854787602,"rank":35414,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":3963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41974,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":71.102509803922,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
