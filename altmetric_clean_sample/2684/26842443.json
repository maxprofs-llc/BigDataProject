DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 61 cats that underwent PU. PROCEDURES Medical records for cats that underwent PU at Gulf Coast Veterinary Specialists between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed. Information regarding signalment, perioperative conditions, surgical procedures, treatments, and postoperative complications were obtained from medical records and by telephone follow-up. RESULTS 11 of 61 (18%) cats developed minor short-term (ie, \u2264 2 months after surgery) complications, 1 of 61 (1.6%) cats developed a major short-term complication requiring surgical revision, and 16 of 38 (42%) cats developed minor long-term complications. No major long-term complications were identified. Preoperative urinary tract infection was significantly associated with development of minor short-term complications, but use of an indwelling urinary catheter after surgery was not significantly associated with development of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that poliglecaprone 25 may be an acceptable suture for apposition of mucosa to skin in cats undergoing PU. Short- and long-term complication rates and percentage of cats requiring revision surgery were comparable to values reported in previous studies in which slowly absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures were used.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5e","authors":["Daniel L.
