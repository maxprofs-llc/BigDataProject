Optical coherence tomography is a new imaging technique analogous to ultrasound B scan that can provide cross-sectional images of the retina with micrometer-scale resolution.\nSurvey optical coherence tomographic examination of the retina, including the macula and optic nerve head in normal human subjects.\nResearch laboratory.\nConvenience sample of normal human subjects.\nCorrelation of optical coherence retinal tomographs with known normal retinal anatomy.\nOptical coherence tomographs can discriminate the cross-sectional morphologic features of the fovea and optic disc, the layered structure of the retina, and normal anatomic variations in retinal and retinal nerve fiber layer thicknesses with 10-microns depth resolution.\nOptical coherence tomography is a potentially useful technique for high depth resolution, cross-sectional examination of the fundus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006afc","authors":["Hee, M R","Izatt, J A","Swanson, E A","Huang, D","Schuman, J S","Lin, C P","Puliafito, C A","Fujimoto, J G","Michael R.
