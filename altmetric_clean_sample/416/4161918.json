Here we demonstrate that Ucn3 is stored and co-released with insulin and potentiates glucose-stimulated somatostatin secretion via cognate receptors on delta cells. Further, we found that islets lacking endogenous Ucn3 have fewer delta cells, reduced somatostatin content, impaired somatostatin secretion, and exaggerated insulin release, and that these defects are rectified by treatment with synthetic Ucn3 in vitro. Our observations indicate that the paracrine actions of Ucn3 activate a negative feedback loop that promotes somatostatin release to ensure the timely reduction of insulin secretion upon normalization of plasma glucose. Moreover, Ucn3 is markedly depleted from beta cells in mouse and macaque models of diabetes and in human diabetic islets. This suggests that Ucn3 is a key contributor to stable glycemic control, whose reduction during diabetes aggravates glycemic volatility and contributes to the pathophysiology of this disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","authors":["Talitha van der Meulen","Cynthia J Donaldson","Elena C\u00e1ceres","Anna E Hunter","Christopher Cowing-Zitron","Lynley D Pound","Michael W Adams","Andreas Zembrzycki","Kevin L Grove","Mark O Huising"],"doi":"10.1038\/nm.3872","endpage":"776","first_seen_on":"2015-06-15T20:36:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1546-170X","1078-8956"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1464596720,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nm.3872","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26076035?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/nm\/rss\/aop\/~3\/m3HfGu00tcE\/nm.3872","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nm\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nm.3872.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/doi:10.1038\/nm.3872.epdf?shared_access_token=fKulhwaDFGn_4r8sOAdN3NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MQ7s_6vDLdH_O7dUr7ZFqlwxcx_Q3PgXf8j4hiHywtaj98yrgpfZjLS5owYvYm02f1x9dACFpZe7rLJq4qlhWDGK9Aw8YpOy7_enfNpBBdWYLXxHnt17zvdZmWKiZhatE%3D","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/doi:10.1038\/nm.3872.epdf?shared_access_token=epyAKvlP8vyuz8mH4h-SBNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MQ7s_6vDLdH_O7dUr7ZFqlwxcx_Q3PgXf8j4hiHywtaj98yrgpfZjLS5owYvYm02f1x9dACFpZe7rLJq4qlhWDGMAULRR1dBRKMwMJ9CcjJmBoB2baMshVGE51cB5b0rI%3D","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1038\/nm.3872","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nm\/journal\/v21\/n7\/full\/nm.3872.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26076035","http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1038%2Fnm.3872"],"pmid":"26076035","pubdate":"2015-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Homeostasis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Type 2 diabetes","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"769","subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"Urocortin3 mediates somatostatin-dependent negative feedback control of insulin secretion","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/urocortin3-mediates-somatostatindependent-negative-feedback-control-insulin-secretion-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":32.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":32.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8016592,"mean":6.7761052824031,"rank":259318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7757800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8016592,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221689,"mean":8.2669345115659,"rank":10081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":211597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221689,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4343,"mean":26.878831414095,"rank":754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4343,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":54.713676470588,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
