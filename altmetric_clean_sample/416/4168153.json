In this work both batch and column experiments were conducted to determine the fate of trace metals in groundwater in the scenarios of CO2 and metal contaminated brine leakage. The sediments for this study were from an unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifer in Kansas, containing 0-4 wt% carbonates. Cd (114 \u00b5g\/L) and As (40 \u00b5g\/L) were spiked into the reaction system to represent potential contaminants from the reservoir brine. Through this research we demonstrated that Cd and As were adsorbed on the sediments, in spite of the lowered pH due to CO2 dissolution in the groundwater. Cd concentrations in the effluent were below the Cd MCL, even for sediments without detectable carbonate to buffer the pH. Arsenic concentrations in the effluent were also significantly lower than the influent concentration, suggesting that the sediments tested have the capacity to mitigate the coupled adverse effects of CO2 leakage and brine intrusion. The mitigation capacity of sediment is a function of its geochemical properties (e.g., the presence of carbonate minerals, adsorbed As, and phosphate).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Hongbo Shao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.est.5b01004","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T12:57:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5851"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1434459342,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.est.5b01004"],"pmid":"26039150","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Coupled Geochemical Impacts of Leaking CO2 and Contaminants from Subsurface Storage Reservoirs on Groundwater Quality","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coupled-geochemical-impacts-leaking-co2-contaminants-subsurface-storage-reservoirs-groundwater-quali"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5227971,"mean":6.1628573717928,"rank":2768192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1778493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5227971,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171431,"mean":8.6987016041534,"rank":95821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":58731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171431,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5241,"mean":9.9284412213741,"rank":3393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5241,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":9.4166569343066,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
