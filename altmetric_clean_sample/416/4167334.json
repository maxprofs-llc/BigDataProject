In 2010 (when aged 45) hospitalized in our clinic with dyspnoea and chest pain with a high pressure reading of 180\/110 mm Hg (identified symptoms of heart failure with LV ejection fraction of 33 %, in NYHA II functional class, echocardiographically: left atrium: 46 mm, left ventricular chamber size in diastole: 70 mm, interventricular septum: 12 mm, septal hypokinesis, Doppler ultrasonography of lower limb arteries (calcification, diffuse atherosclerotic changes, absent stenosis), CT coronary angiography (significant stenosis of the left coronary artery). Treatment started with 40 mg oral dose of furosemide daily. In May 2011 he was hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome: acute NSTEMI of the inferior wall (coronarography: 2-vascular problems, implemented PKI, implanted DES - ramus circumflexus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NYHA III functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction: 30 %, pulmonary hypertension). In 2012 renal denervation for resistant hypertension was carried out, carotid stent implanted for stenosis of the carotid artery, presence of diabetic nephropathy (KDOQI stage 3, GF 40 ml\/min). In August 2014 admitted to our clinic with pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock, acute ischemia of the right calf with peripheral embolisation, presence of atrial flutter, impairment of renal parameters, echocardiographically: left atrium: 55 mm, left ventricle size: 75 mm, akinesis of the septum and posterior wall, occlusion of the right leg arteries (given the patients serious state angio-surgical intervention was contraindicated, vitally indicated leg amputation considered), the patient died after 4 days of hospitalization in an intensive care unit after unsuccessful treatment. A combination of diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart disease is frequent and prognostically serious. Diabetes increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and therefore we should check for diabetes in all cardiovascular patients.Key words: acute coronary syndrome - type 2 diabetes mellitus - hypertension - ischemic heart disease - cardiogenic shock.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000da8f","authors":["Pernick\u00fd, Miroslav","Papin\u010d\u00e1k, Juraj","Reptov\u00e1, Adriana","Ki\u0148ov\u00e1, So\u0148a","Mur\u00edn, J\u00e1n"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T10:38:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0042-773X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Vnitr\u0306n\u00ed l\u00e9kar\u0306stv\u00ed","last_mentioned_on":1434451089,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26075854?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26075854","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"[What may cause diabetes].","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cause-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5227971,"mean":6.1628573717928,"rank":4349636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5227971,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171431,"mean":8.6987016041534,"rank":139357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171431,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":0.78875,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
