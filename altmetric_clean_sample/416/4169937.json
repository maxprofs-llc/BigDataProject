A total of 10 participants who identified themselves as suffering from body dysmorphic disorder took photographs that related to their body dysmorphic disorder experience. Photographs were discussed in interviews. It was found that mirror gazing in body dysmorphic disorder is an embodied phenomenon. Motivations for mirror gazing were confusing, complex and masochistic. Overall, participants described mirrors as being controlling, imprisoning and disempowering forces that had a crippling and paralysing effect on life. It is argued that health psychologists must ask clients about their embodied experiences when looking in the mirror.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Silver, Joanna","Farrants, Jacqui","Silver, J.","Joanna Silver","Jacqui Farrants"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105315581516","endpage":"2657","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T19:09:27+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1477656045,"links":["http:\/\/m.hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/05\/1359105315581516.full?ijkey=lBCIim3RExeqM%3Fview%3Dfull&ijkey=lBCIim3RExeqM&keytype=ref&keytype=ref&siteid=sphpq&siteid=sphpq&uritype=cgi","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1359105315581516","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/full\/1359105315581516?ijkey=lBCIim3RExeqM&keytype=ref&siteid=sphpq","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/05\/1359105315581516.abstract","http:\/\/openaccess.city.ac.uk\/11816\/","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/full\/1359105315581516?ijkey=x6Easru7PFXyo&keytype=ref&siteid=sphpq","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/cgi\/content\/long\/21\/11\/2647"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/05\/05\/1359105315581516.full.pdf","pmid":"25947231","pubdate":"2015-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2647","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"\u2018I Once Stared at Myself in the Mirror for Eleven Hours.\u2019 Exploring mirror gazing in participants with body dysmorphic disorder","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/i-once-stared-myself-mirror-eleven-hours-exploring-mirror-gazing-participants-body-dysmorphic-disord"},"altmetric_score":{"score":52.168,"score_history":{"1y":8.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":52.168},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":148879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7458897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211297,"mean":8.2195363281843,"rank":5856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":205441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211297,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1237,"mean":6.2972216828479,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1237,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":5.4456666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
