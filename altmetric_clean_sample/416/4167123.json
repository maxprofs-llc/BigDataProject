However, whether such regulation could influence the reutilization of iron stored in root apoplast remains unclear. In this study, we observed that iron deficiency elevated NO level in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots. However, application of S-nitrosoglutathione, a NO donor, significantly enhanced iron retention in root apoplast of iron-deficient plants, accompanied with a decrease of iron level in xylem sap. Consequently, S-nitrosoglutathione treatment increased iron concentration in roots, but decreased it in shoots. The opposite was true for the NO scavenging treatment with 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO). Interestingly, S-nitrosoglutathione treatment increased pectin methylesterase activity and decreased degree of pectin methylation in root cell wall of both iron-deficient and iron-sufficient plants, which led to an increased iron retention in pectin fraction, thus increasing the binding capacity of iron to the extracted cell wall. Altogether, these results suggested that iron-deficiency-induced elevation of NO increases iron immobilization in root apoplast by decreasing pectin methylation in cell wall.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ye, Yi Quan","Jin, Chong Wei","Fan, Shi Kai","Mao, Qian Qian","Sun, Cheng Liang","Yu, Yan","Lin, Xian Yong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep10746","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T10:12:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1463230150,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26073914?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26073914","pubdate":"2015-06-16T22:04:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant physiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Abiotic","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Elevation of NO production increases Fe immobilization in the Fe-deficiency roots apoplast by decreasing pectin methylation of cell wall.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/elevation-production-increases-fe-immobilization-fedeficiency-roots-apoplast-decreasing-pectin-methy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":6657633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211755,"mean":8.2522278870766,"rank":177700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211755,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30254,"mean":14.925813638317,"rank":25826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30254,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1698,"mean":11.106120212139,"rank":1461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1698,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
