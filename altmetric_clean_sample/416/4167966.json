The present study investigated the effects of risedronate on serum ferritin levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\nIn an open-label, prospective, uncontrolled study, 68 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were evaluated. Study participants received risedronate orally at a dose of 35 mg\/week during a 6-month treatment period. Blood sampling for lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c, insulin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, osteoprotegerin, and ferritin was performed at baseline and after 6 months of treatment. Pulse-wave velocity and augmentation index at baseline were determined using SphygmoCor version 7.1 (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).\nMean (SD) serum ferritin decreased significantly from 62.1 (44.8) to 46.7 (29.4) \u03bcg\/dL (P < 0.0001) during the treatment period. On multiple linear regression analysis, the significant predictors of \u0394ferritin were pulse-wave velocity (P = 0.04; effect size, 0.188), C-reactive protein (P = 0.021; effect size, 0.043), insulin (P = 0.011; effect size, 0.100), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.046; effect size, 0.132) at baseline.\nRisedronate treatment is associated with significantly decreased serum ferritin levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b2c","authors":["Feldbrin, Zeev","Luckish, Alla","Shargorodsky, Marina"],"doi":"10.1097\/gme.0000000000000480","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T11:56:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0374"],"journal":"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","last_mentioned_on":1434455775,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26057821"],"pmid":"26057821","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Effects of long-term risedronate treatment on serum ferritin levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis: the impact of cardiovascular risk factor load.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-longterm-risedronate-treatment-serum-ferritin-levels-postmenopausal-women-osteoporosis-impac-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228922,"mean":6.1649666082185,"rank":3677286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":877962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228922,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171435,"mean":8.7000049931754,"rank":120947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171435,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":761,"mean":9.3353684210526,"rank":558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":761,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":6.4572,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
