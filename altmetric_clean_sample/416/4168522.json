Vascular reactivity was measured by the flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMVD) test. Endothelin-1, high sensitive-C reactive protein (hsCRP), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), paraoxonase and adiponectin levels and FMVD were evaluated before and after the exposure.\nSubjects were young (Age: 32\u00b16years), lean [Body mass index: 23.9\u00b12.0kg\/m(2), waist circumference: 77(IQR: 72-80) cm] and presented normal clinical and biochemical parameters. No significant changes were evidenced in FMVD in response to HH (pre: 0.45 (0.20-0.70) vs. during: 0.50 (0.20-1.22) mm; p=0.594) On the other hand, endothelin-1 (+54%, p<0.05), hsCRP (+37%, p<0.001), IL-6 (+75%,p<0.05), TNF-\u03b1 (+75%,p<0.05) and adiponectin (-39%, p<0.01) levels were significantly altered post-HH. FMVD was increased in 7 subjects and it was decreased in 3 individuals during HH exposure. Interestingly, when EF biomarkers were compared between these two subgroups of subjects, only post exposure-adiponectin levels were significantly different (49\u00b15 vs. 38\u00b16\u03bcg\/ml, respectively, p<0.05).\nHH exposure had an effect on endothelin-1, adiponectin, hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 concentration. However, adiponectin was the only biomarker associated with an altered vascular reactivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377d","authors":["Iglesias, Diego","Rosso, Leonardo G\u00f3mez","Vainstein, Nora","Mero\u00f1o, Tom\u00e1s","Lez\u00f3n, Christian","Brites, Fernando"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinbiochem.2015.06.007","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T14:17:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2933"],"journal":"Clinical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1434464226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26074444?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26074444","pubdate":"2015-06-16T22:03:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Vascular reactivity and biomarkers of endothelial function in healthy subjects exposed to acute hypobaric hypoxia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-reactivity-biomarkers-endothelial-function-healthy-subjects-exposed-acute-hypobaric-hypoxia-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228400,"mean":6.1636048866991,"rank":4350229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228400,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171431,"mean":8.6993128157267,"rank":139363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171431,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":555,"mean":2.4965018050542,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":555,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.35,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
