As recent studies have shown that loss of ribosomal protein (RP) S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) increases systemic insulin sensitivity, S6K1 inhibitors are being pursued as potential agents for improving insulin resistance. Here we found that S6K1 deficiency in mice also leads to decreased \u03b2 cell growth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and impaired placental development. IUGR is a common complication of human pregnancy that limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the developing fetus, leading to diminished embryonic \u03b2 cell growth and the onset of T2DM later in life. However, restoration of placental development and the rescue of IUGR by tetraploid embryo complementation did not restore \u03b2 cell size or insulin levels in S6K1-\/- embryos, suggesting that loss of S6K1 leads to an intrinsic \u03b2 cell lesion. Consistent with this hypothesis, reexpression of S6K1 in \u03b2 cells of S6K1-\/- mice restored embryonic \u03b2 cell size, insulin levels, glucose tolerance, and RPS6 phosphorylation, without rescuing IUGR. Together, these data suggest that a nutrient-mediated reduction in intrinsic \u03b2 cell S6K1 signaling, rather than IUGR, during fetal development may underlie reduced \u03b2 cell growth and eventual development of T2DM later in life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["Sung Hee Um","Melanie Sticker-Jantscheff","Gia Cac Chau","Kristina Vintersten","Matthias Mueller","Yann-Gael Gangloff","Ralf H.
