All G-proteins require activation via exchange of GDP for GTP to carry out their respective tasks. Often, guanine-nucleotide exchange factors are essential to this process. During translation, EF-Tu:GTP transports aminoacylated tRNA to the ribosome. GTP is hydrolyzed during this process, and subsequent reactivation of EF-Tu is catalyzed by EF-Ts. The reaction path of guanine-nucleotide exchange is structurally poorly defined for EF-Tu and EF-Ts. We have determined the crystal structures of the following reaction intermediates: two structures of EF-Tu:GDP:EF-Ts (2.2 and 1.8 \u00c5 resolution), EF-Tu:PO4:EF-Ts (1.9 \u00c5 resolution), EF-Tu:GDPNP:EF-Ts (2.2 \u00c5 resolution) and EF-Tu:GDPNP:pulvomycin:Mg(2+):EF-Ts (3.5 \u00c5 resolution). These structures provide snapshots throughout the entire exchange reaction and suggest a mechanism for the release of EF-Tu in its GTP conformation. An inferred sequence of events during the exchange reaction is presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3d","authors":["Thirup, S\u00f8ren S","Van, Lan Bich","Nielsen, Tine K","Knudsen, Charlotte R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsb.2015.06.011","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T10:03:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8657"],"journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1434448928,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26073967?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26073967","pubdate":"2015-06-16T22:04:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Structural outline of the detailed mechanism for elongation factor Ts-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange on elongation factor Tu.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-outline-detailed-mechanism-elongation-factor-tsmediated-guanine-nucleotide-exchange-elong"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5228922,"mean":6.1649666082185,"rank":4350583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5228922,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171434,"mean":8.7000542835979,"rank":139366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171434,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":2.3248888888889,"rank":350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.6258,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
