However, little information is available on their involvement in fruit ripening. We have characterized 25 MaDof genes from banana fruit (Musa acuminata), designated as MaDof1-MaDof25. Gene expression analysis in fruit subjected to different ripening conditions revealed that MaDofs were differentially expressed during different stages of ripening. MaDof10, 23, 24, and 25 were ethylene-inducible and nuclear-localized, and their transcript levels increased during fruit ripening. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses demonstrated a physical interaction between MaDof23 and MaERF9, a potential regulator of fruit ripening reported in a previous study. We determined that MaDof23 is a transcriptional repressor, whereas MaERF9 is a transcriptional activator. We suggest that they might act antagonistically in regulating 10 ripening-related genes, including MaEXP1\/2\/3\/5, MaXET7, MaPG1, MaPME3, MaPL2, MaCAT, and MaPDC, which are associated with cell wall degradation and aroma formation. Taken together, our findings provide new insight into the transcriptional regulation network controlling banana fruit ripening.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","authors":["Feng, Bi-Hong","Han, Yan-Chao","Xiao, Yun-Yi","Kuang, Jian-Fei","Fan, Zhong-Qi","Chen, Jian-Ye","Lu, Wang-Jin"],"doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/erw032","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T15:14:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2431"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1455894850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26889012?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26889012","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:00:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"The banana fruit Dof transcription factor MaDof23 acts as a repressor and interacts with MaERF9 in regulating ripening-related genes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/banana-fruit-dof-transcription-factor-madof23-acts-repressor-interacts-maerf9-regulating-ripeningrel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7214390,"mean":6.3538386288811,"rank":5430506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7214390,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283779,"mean":10.333813685345,"rank":198453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283779,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2431,"mean":3.1403530864198,"rank":1840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2431,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":3.3137105263158,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/700699906537721857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5688945],"posted_on":"2016-02-19T15:14:10+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
