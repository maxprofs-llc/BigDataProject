A highly enantioselective (99% ee), intramolecular Ir-catalyzed Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indole 9 with a secondary allylic alcohol was utilized to establish the first stereogenic center upon which the other three contiguous chiral centers were readily set by a highly stereoselective tandem 1,4-addition and aldol reaction. The key tetrahydropyran was constructed through a hemiacetal reduction, and the final aminal bridge was forged by a one-pot reductive amination\/cyclization. The conciseness of this approach was highlighted by building core bonds in each step with a minimalist protecting group strategy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xiao Liang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b00625","endpage":"2562","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T14:02:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1520-5126","0002-7863"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1462550352,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1021\/jacs.6b00625","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b00625"],"pmid":"26882407","pubdate":"2016-02-19T22:04:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2560","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (\u2212)-Alstoscholarisine A","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enantioselective-total-synthesis-alstoscholarisine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.944,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.944},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7688550,"mean":6.5952610199864,"rank":444590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7244015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7688550,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287094,"mean":10.467390671315,"rank":25273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":261820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287094,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18319,"mean":5.0606616442843,"rank":825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":17494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18319,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":406,"mean":7.6292148148148,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":406,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
