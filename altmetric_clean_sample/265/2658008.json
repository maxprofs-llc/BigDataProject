Dysregulation of AMPK signaling has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with abnormal neuronal energy metabolism. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that aberrant AMPK signaling underlies AD-associated synaptic plasticity impairments by using pharmacological and genetic approaches. We found that amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhancement of long-term depression were corrected by the AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC). Similarly, LTP impairments in APP\/PS1 transgenic mice that model AD were improved by CC treatment. In addition, A\u03b2-induced LTP failure was prevented in mice with genetic deletion of the AMPK \u03b12-subunit, the predominant AMPK catalytic subunit in the brain. Furthermore, we found that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and its kinase eEF2K are key downstream effectors that mediate the detrimental effects of hyperactive AMPK in AD pathophysiology. Our findings describe a previously unrecognized role of aberrant AMPK signaling in AD-related synaptic pathophysiology and reveal a potential therapeutic target for AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Tao Ma","Yiran Chen","Valerie Vingtdeux","Haitian Zhao","Benoit Viollet","Philippe Marambaud","Eric Klann"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1694-14.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T10:18:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"36","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1415726955,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25186765?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25186765?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25186765","pubdate":"2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Inhibition of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Alleviates Impairments in Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity Induced by Amyloid \u03b2.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-ampactivated-protein-kinase-signaling-alleviates-impairments-hippocampal-synaptic-plastic-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561630,"mean":6.0798051118097,"rank":3117152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1959731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561630,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158269,"mean":8.1899718073144,"rank":80418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":59336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158269,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11223,"mean":8.9024106219925,"rank":7235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11223,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":326,"mean":11.513384615385,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":326,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
