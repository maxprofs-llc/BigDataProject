Over 90% of all clinical cases of \u03b11AT deficiency are caused by the Z variant in which Glu342, located at the top of s5A, is replaced by a Lys which results in polymerization both in vivo and in vitro. The Glu342Lys mutation removes a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond but does not effect the thermodynamic stability of Z \u03b11AT compared to the wild type protein, M \u03b11AT, and so it is unclear why Z \u03b11AT has an increased polymerization propensity. We speculated that the loss of these interactions would make the native state of Z \u03b11AT more dynamic than M \u03b11AT and that this change renders the protein more polymerization prone. We have used hydrogen\/deuterium exchange combined with mass spectrometry (HXMS) to determine the structural and dynamic differences between native Z and M \u03b11AT to reveal the molecular basis of Z \u03b11AT polymerization. Our HXMS data shows that the Z mutation significantly perturbs the region around the site of mutation. Strikingly the Z mutation also alters the dynamics of regions distant to the mutation such as the B, D and I helices and specific regions of each \u03b2-sheet. These changes in global dynamics may lead to an increase in the likelihood of Z \u03b11AT sampling a polymerogenic structure thereby causing disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Victoria A.
