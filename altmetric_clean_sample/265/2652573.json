The clinical spectrum is broad, ranging from the classical most severe Zellweger syndrome to patients with a relatively mild phenotype. Treatment options are limited to symptomatic and supportive therapy. During routine follow-up we discovered patients with asymptomatic primary adrenal insufficiency. It is important to detect impaired adrenal function because it has treatment implications. Primary adrenal insufficiency was found in 7\/24 patients examined, with 4\/7 being asymptomatic. Systematic evaluation of adrenal function, through a Synacthen test, should be included in the clinical management of these patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000087f","doi":"10.1186\/s13023-014-0133-5","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T19:24:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1750-1172"],"issue":"1","journal":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1409752386,"links":["http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/9\/1\/133\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ojrd.com\/content\/pdf\/s13023-014-0133-5.pdf","pmid":"25179809","pubdate":"2014-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"133","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"High prevalence of primary adrenal insufficiency in Zellweger spectrum disorders","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-prevalence-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-zellweger-spectrum-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3571907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116127,"mean":8.0829215335069,"rank":87054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116127,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":775,"mean":3.3778294573643,"rank":697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":775,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":3.8119024390244,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SeqComplete\/status\/507164385526415360","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2652573],"posted_on":"2014-09-03T13:53:06+00:00","author":{"name":"SeqComplete","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/432012289185546240\/nESezhJN_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest Buzzz in Cutting-Edge #NGS #Genomics #PersonalizedMedicine #PrecisionMedicine #LiquidBiopsy  #BioIT  #RNASeq #CRISPR #Geneediting #Bigdata","id_on_source":"SeqComplete","tweeter_id":"335246117","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3084},"tweet_id":"507164385526415360"}]}}
