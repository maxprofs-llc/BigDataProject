Understanding the organellar environment and dynamics of mitochondrial proteins requires quantitative measurement in vivo. In this study, we have validated a method for immobilizing both procyclic stage (PS) and bloodstream stage (BS) T. brucei brucei with a high level of cell viability over several hours and verified its suitability for undertaking fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), with mitochondrion-targeted yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Next, we used this method for comparative analysis of the translational diffusion of mitochondrial RNA-binding protein 1 (MRP1) in the BS and in T. b. evansi. The latter flagellate is like petite mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae because it lacks organelle-encoded nucleic acids. FRAP measurement of YFP-tagged MRP1 in both cell lines illuminated from a new perspective how the absence or presence of RNA affects proteins involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism. This work represents the first attempt to examine this process in live trypanosomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007317","authors":["Huang Z","Kaltenbrunner S","Simkov\u00e1 E","Stan\u011bk D","Luke\u0161 J","Hashimi H"],"doi":"10.1128\/ec.00149-14","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T12:34:50+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Eukaryotic Cell","last_mentioned_on":1406460062,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25063375?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25063375","pubdate":"2014-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The Dynamics of Mitochondrial RNA-binding Protein Complex in Trypanosoma brucei and its Petite Mutant Under Optimized Immobilization Conditions.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamics-mitochondrial-rnabinding-protein-complex-trypanosoma-brucei-petite-mutant-under-optimized-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4081491,"mean":5.0862971137051,"rank":3266738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":101304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4081491,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106887,"mean":8.1805182905154,"rank":85273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106887,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":1.945004,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.2143333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
