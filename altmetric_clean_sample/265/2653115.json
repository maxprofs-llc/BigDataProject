The scope of this article is to identify the profiles of technical and scientific publications in the specialized database. Based on systematic searches and the analysis of results it is possible to determine: the type of publication; the main topics addressed; the most common type of disasters mentioned in published materials, countries and regions as subjects, historic periods with the most publications and the current trend of publications. When examining the specialized data in detail, it soon becomes clear that the number of major topics is very high, making a specific search process in this database a challenging exercise. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the disaster topic is discussed and assessed in a broad and diversified manner, associated with different aspects of the natural and social sciences. The disaster issue requires the production of interdisciplinary knowledge development to reduce the impacts of disasters and for risk management. In this way, since the health sector is a interdisciplinary area, it can contribute to knowledge production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eb6","authors":["Vania Rocha","Elisa Francioli Ximenes","Mauren Lopes de Carvalho","Tais de Moura Ariza Alpino","Carlos Machado de Freitas"],"first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T20:45:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1678-4561"],"issue":"9","journal":"Ci\u00eancia & Sa\u00fade Coletiva","last_mentioned_on":1409826859,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25184583?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=4melow"],"pmid":"25184583","pubdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"[The theme of disaster in health care: profile of technical and scientific production in the specialized database on disasters of the Virtual Health Library - VHL.]","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theme-disaster-health-care-profile-technical-scientific-production-specialized-database-disasters-vi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4655094,"mean":5.6505438971925,"rank":3293349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":760461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4655094,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119000,"mean":8.5147389137725,"rank":80577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":23979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119000,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":1.4949709762533,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":3,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/4MeLOW\/status\/507476744748539908","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2653115],"posted_on":"2014-09-04T10:34:19+00:00","author":{"name":"MeLOW","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117079728374234431856","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2387653297\/earth_globe_org_normal.jpg","description":"This MeLOW stands for Medical Librarians Of the World, an initiative to discover and explore new Worlds & new ways information can travel, like Google+","id_on_source":"4MeLOW","tweeter_id":"632750407","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":93},"tweet_id":"507476744748539908"}]}}
