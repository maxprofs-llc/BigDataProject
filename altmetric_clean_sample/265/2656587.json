CM treatment had different effects on wine aroma depending on the types of fermenter, being more effective for automatic pumping-over tank (PO-tank) than automatic punching-down tank (PD-tank). When PO-tank was used, CM-treated wine showed a decrease in some fusel alcohols (isobutanol and isopentanol) and an increase in some esters (especially acetate esters). However, no significant changes were detected in these compounds when PD-tank was used. Ethyl 2-hexenoate and diethyl succinate were decreased, while geranylacetone was increased by the CM treatment in both fermenters. \u03b2-Damascenone was increased by the CM treatment in PO-tank fermented wines but decreased in PD-tank fermented wines. The fruity, caramel and floral aroma series were enhanced while chemical series were decreased by the CM treatment in PO-tank fermented wines. The content of (Z)-6-nonen-1-ol in the final wines was positively correlated to CM treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Cai J","Zhu BQ","Wang YH","Lu L","Lan YB","Reeves MJ","Duan CQ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2014.01.003","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T05:19:32+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1409774153,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24518336?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24518336","pubdate":"2014-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Influence of pre-fermentation cold maceration treatment on aroma compounds of Cabernet Sauvignon wines fermented in different industrial scale fermenters.","type":"article","volume":"154","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-prefermentation-cold-maceration-treatment-aroma-compounds-cabernet-sauvignon-wines-ferment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4212055,"mean":5.1290379762681,"rank":3363682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4212055,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110032,"mean":8.2391085421382,"rank":87842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110032,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1949,"mean":2.9144568788501,"rank":1332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1949,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.2151764705882,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
