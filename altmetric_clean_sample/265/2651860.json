Many trainees will leave research-intensive institutions and apply to faculty positions at academic institutions with a high emphasis on teaching responsibilities. The Professional Skills Training is a novel course offered by the APS for young trainees that provides useful formal training in teaching. This advancement toward the improvement in teaching skills in young trainees in science is critical and has the potential to make a significant impact in students' lives and career paths.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["John Clemmer"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpheart.00612.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T17:39:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1539"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Heart & Circulatory Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1410456357,"links":["http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/27\/ajpheart.00612.2014","http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/29\/ajpheart.00612.2014"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajpheart.physiology.org\/content\/ajpheart\/early\/2014\/08\/27\/ajpheart.00612.2014.full.pdf","pmid":"25172900","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","cardiology"],"title":"New Investigator Editorial: Professional Skills Training in Effective Science Teaching","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-investigator-editorial-professional-skills-training-effective-science-teaching"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":620456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3884542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116128,"mean":8.0614602977776,"rank":20174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":95862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116128,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1087,"mean":1.9765580110497,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1087,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.0928571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":7,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AJPHeartEditor\/status\/507227353966080000","license":"datasift","rt":["ajpheartcirc"],"citation_ids":[2651860],"posted_on":"2014-09-03T18:03:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Irving H.
