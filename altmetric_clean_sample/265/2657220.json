Primary-care physicians and dermatologists need to have a systematic approach in the assessment of such dermatoses. This article describes an interesting case of possible kerosene-induced and diesel-induced skin injury in an asylum seeker arriving on a boat. Dermatological conditions in asylum seekers and a suggested template for skin assessment are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002358","authors":["Cheng HM","Kumarasinghe SP"],"doi":"10.1111\/ajd.12183","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T07:15:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0004-8380"],"issue":"","journal":"Australasian Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1409738757,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25178452?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25178452","pubdate":"2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Dermatological problems of asylum seekers arriving on boats: A case report from Australia and a brief review.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dermatological-problems-asylum-seekers-arriving-boats-case-report-australia-brief-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2294906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1620090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116198,"mean":8.0613653364547,"rank":56132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":46787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116198,"percentile":40},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":2.0128791946309,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.48125,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
