CHSs are now beset by three dilemmas: ongoing organisational fragmentation; the extension of competition law and the spread of privatisation; inadequate workforce development and lack of clarity on the nature of CHS activity. This has left the services in a position of policy and political vulnerability. The solution may be for the service to be part of horizontal integration models such as the accountable care organisation, with a focus on locality and multi-professional teams wrapped around patient pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002440","authors":["Bob Hudson"],"doi":"10.12968\/bjcn.2014.19.9.428","endpage":"431","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T07:52:44+00:00","issns":["1462-4753","2052-2215"],"issue":"9","journal":"British Journal of Community Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1409917152,"links":["http:\/\/www.magonlinelibrary.com\/doi\/abs\/10.12968\/bjcn.2014.19.9.428","http:\/\/www.magonlinelibrary.com\/doi\/abs\/10.12968\/bjcn.2014.19.9.428?queryID=%24%7BresultBean.queryID%7D&"],"pmid":"25184895","pubdate":"2014-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"428","subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Policy paradox and political neglect in community health services","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/policy-paradox-political-neglect-community-health-services-cover-story"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":810894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3693098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116186,"mean":8.0263176313639,"rank":24652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":91473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116186,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":1.448421875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.185,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":4},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bob__Hudson\/status\/507798177190137856","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2657623],"posted_on":"2014-09-05T07:51:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Bob Hudson","url":"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/bob-hudson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/890632653690601473\/LUDpPa1P_normal.jpg","description":"Public policy academic, University of Kent.
