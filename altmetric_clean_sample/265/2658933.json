High-resolution Ni patterns are generated from NiO NP thin films by a vacuum-free, lithography-free, and solution-processable route. In particular, a continuous wave laser is used for the LDW reductive sintering of the metal oxide under ambient conditions with the aid of reducing agents in the ink solvent. Thin (\u223c40 nm) Ni electrodes of glossy metallic surfaces with smooth morphology and excellent edge definition can be fabricated. By applying this method, we demonstrate a high transmittance (>87%), electrically conducting panel for a touch screen panel application. The resistivity of the Ni electrode is less than an order of magnitude higher compared to that of the bulk Ni. Mechanical bending test, tape-pull test, and ultrasonic bath test confirm the robust adhesion of the electrodes on glass and polymer substrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Daeho Lee"],"doi":"10.1021\/nn503383z","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T14:17:02+00:00","issns":["1936-0851"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1409931332,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn503383z"],"pmid":"25130917","pubdate":"2014-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Vacuum-Free, Maskless Patterning of Ni Electrodes by Laser Reductive Sintering of NiO Nanoparticle Ink and Its Application to Transparent Conductors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vacuumfree-maskless-patterning-ni-electrodes-laser-reductive-sintering-nio-nanoparticle-ink-applicat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4219486,"mean":5.1285084177415,"rank":3192298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":849959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4219486,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110204,"mean":8.2319551010408,"rank":83012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110204,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3297,"mean":8.8377991504854,"rank":2526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3297,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":9.5151869158879,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
