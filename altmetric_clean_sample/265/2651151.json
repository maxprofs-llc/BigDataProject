Further, the growth evolution of pyramidal Cu nanoparticles was observed for the first time. We believe that our method might open new possibilities for fabricating nanomaterials of non-noble transition metals with various novel architectures, which can then potentially be utilized in applications such as biosensors, catalysis, photovoltaic cells, and electronic nanodevices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009NRL.....4.1481K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Wen-Yin Ko","Wei-Hung Chen","Ching-Yuan Cheng","Kaun-Jiuh Lin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11671-009-9424-5","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T16:08:39+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1409841312,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2893912\/figure\/F1\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2893912","pmid":"20652131","pubdate":"2014-09-04T20:09:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Engineering, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Materials Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physics, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"1481","title":"Architectural Growth of Cu Nanoparticles Through Electrodeposition","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/architectural-growth-cu-nanoparticles-through-electrodeposition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4216710,"mean":5.1296613826895,"rank":3367387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":115988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4216710,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110056,"mean":8.2303255281451,"rank":87867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110056,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":0.96415751789976,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.84375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
