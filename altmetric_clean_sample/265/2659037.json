Doing so allows each of these components to exist in an environment optimised for purpose. We make use of a poorly-known feature of the handle system for assigning persistent identifiers which allows an individual datafile from a larger fileset to be retrieved according to its file-name or its MIME type. The data objects allow facile visualisation and retrieval for re-use of the data, and facilitates other operations such as data mining. Examples from five recently published articles illustrate these concepts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Matthew Harvey ","Matthew J.
