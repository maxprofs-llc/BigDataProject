(T.

The basic motions of these materials are contraction-expansion and bending-unbending, which are observed mainly in polysiloxanes and polyacrylates that contain photochromic moieties. Other sophisticated motions such as twisting, oscillation, rotation, and translational motion have also been achieved. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve the photoresponsive and mechanical properties of this novel class of materials through the modification of molecular structures, development of new fabrication methods, and construction of composite structures. Herein, we review structures, functions, and working mechanisms of photomobile materials and recent advances in this field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Ube, Toru","Ikeda, Tomiki"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201400513","endpage":"10299","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T01:34:41+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"39","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
