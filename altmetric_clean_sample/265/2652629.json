Accumulative evidence supports that 7,8-DHF exerts the neurotrophic effects in a TrkB-dependent manner; nonetheless, the differences between 7,8-DHF and BDNF in activating TrkB remain incompletely understood. Here we show that 7,8-DHF and BDNF exhibit different TrkB activation kinetics, for which TrkB maturation may be implicated. Employing two independent biophysical approaches, we confirm that 7,8-DHF robustly interacts with the TrkB extracellular domain (ECD) with a Kd of approximately 10 nM. While BDNF transiently activates TrkB, leading to receptor internalization and ubiquitination\/degradation, in contrast, 7,8-DHF-triggered TrkB phosphorylation lasts for hours, and the internalized receptors are not degraded. Notably, primary neuronal maturation may be required for 7,8-DHF but not BDNF to elicit the full spectrum of TrkB signaling cascades. Hence, 7,8-DHF robustly interacts with the TrkB receptor and its agonistic effect may be mediated by neuronal development and maturation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Xia Liu","Obiamaka Obianyo","Chi Bun Chan","Junjian Huang","Shenghui Xue","Jenny Yang","Fanxing Zheng","Mark Goodman","Keqiang Ye"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m114.562561","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T19:30:08+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1437841825,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/20\/jbc.M114.562561.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=25143381","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M114.562561","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25143381"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/20\/jbc.M114.562561.full.pdf","pmid":"25143381","pubdate":"2014-08-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biochemical and Biophysical Investigation of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Mimetic 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone in Binding and Activation of TrkB Receptor.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biochemical-biophysical-investigation-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-mimetic-78dihydroxyflavone-bi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5398122,"mean":6.2980505861207,"rank":1257957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":4117656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5398122,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139219,"mean":8.5613437486534,"rank":37097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":101549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139219,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28376,"mean":3.0088528634361,"rank":2344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":25931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28376,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.6481661129568,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
