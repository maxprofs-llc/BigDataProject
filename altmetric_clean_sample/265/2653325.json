As a result, single rooms are 'blocked' by patients with non-infectious diarrhoea, while patients with infectious diarrhoea are still in open bays because of a lack of free side rooms. A rapid test for differentiating infectious from non-infectious diarrhoea could be very beneficial for patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000592b","authors":["Pankhurst L","Macfarlane-Smith L","Buchanan J","Anson L","Davies K","O'Connor L","Ashwin H","Pike G","Dingle KE","Peto TE","Wordsworth S","Walker AS","Wilcox MH","Crook DW","Louise Pankhurst","Louissa Macfarlane-Smith","James Buchanan","Luke Anson","Kerrie Davies","Lily O\u2019Connor","Helen Ashwin","Graham Pike","Kate E Dingle","Timothy EA Peto","Sarah Wordsworth","A Sarah Walker","Mark H Wilcox","Derrick W Crook"],"doi":"10.3310\/hta18530","endpage":"167","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T21:20:18+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1366-5278","2046-4924"],"issue":"53","journal":"Health technology assessment : HTA \/ NHS R & D HTA Programme.","last_mentioned_on":1431737710,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25146932?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3310\/hta18530"],"pmid":"25146932","pubdate":"2014-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Can rapid integrated polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics for gastrointestinal pathogens improve routine hospital infection control practice?
