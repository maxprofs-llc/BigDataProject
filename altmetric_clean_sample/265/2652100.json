Mutations in FBN1 gene have been identified in AD, GD and WMS patients. By targeted next-generation sequencing of skeletal dysplasia-related genes, including FBN1 and ADAMTSL2, three novel missense mutations, c.5189A>T (p.N1730I), c.5198G>T (p.C1733F), c.5243G>T (p.C1748F), and one known mutation c.5198G>A (p.C1733Y) of FBN1 gene were identified in four probands, respectively. Clinically, p.C1733Y was associated with GD, as reported previously, as well as the novel p.N1730I, whereas p.C1733F and p.C1748F were associated with AD and WMS. Interestingly, different mutations at the same codon (p.C1733Y and p.C1733F) were associated with different phenotypes (GD and AD, respectively). However, the mutations p.C1748F and p.C1748R were associated with WMS. Our data support the importance of TGF\u03b2-binding protein-like domain 5 of FBN1 protein in pathogenicity of acromelic dysplasia, and expands the genotype\/phenotype relations of these rare forms of fibrilliopathies.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 21 August 2014; doi:10.1038\/jhg.2014.73.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Wang Y","Zhang H","Ye J","Han L","Gu X"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2014.73","first_seen_on":"2014-09-04T18:13:58+00:00","issns":["1434-5161"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1409801707,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25142510?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25142510","pubdate":"2014-08-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Disease genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Three novel mutations of the FBN1 gene in Chinese children with acromelic dysplasia.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-novel-mutations-fbn1-gene-chinese-children-acromelic-dysplasia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":2481533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2395432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133414,"mean":8.4252805498719,"rank":61522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":66473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133414,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":676,"mean":5.3659703703704,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":676,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":6.1,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LeucineRichBio\/status\/507368740468822016","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2652100],"posted_on":"2014-09-04T03:25:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Leucine Rich Bio","url":"http:\/\/www.leucinerichbio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/758354770432106496\/9VhuRBEI_normal.jpg","description":"Experience the Next Generation Analysis #Cancer #RareDiseases #PersonalizedMedicine #Sequencing #Genomics","id_on_source":"LeucineRichBio","tweeter_id":"434875052","geo":{"lt":12.97194,"ln":77.59369,"country":"IN"},"followers":1671},"tweet_id":"507368740468822016"}],"googleplus":[{"title":"Three novel mutations of the FBN1 gene in Chinese children with acromelic dysplasia. http:\/\/www.ncbi...","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117778779267232226984\/posts\/NwXAhvJPQwP","citation_ids":[2652100],"posted_on":"2014-09-04T03:35:07+00:00","summary":"Three novel mutations of the FBN1 gene in Chinese children with acromelic dysplasia. http:\/\/www.ncbi...
