Due to its visual nature, dermatology is ideally suited to benefit from this new technology. The use of teledermatology (telemedicine in dermatology) in a primary care setting allows for an expert opinion without the need for an in-person referral. Furthermore, it can improve patient access in remote areas. Store-and-forward teledermatology is the most commonly employed method.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Lenardis MA","Solomon RS","Leung FH"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-0500-7-588","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T07:08:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1409741647,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25178423?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffera18de&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"25178423","pubdate":"2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Store-and-forward teledermatology: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/storeandforward-teledermatology-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3569961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116198,"mean":8.0612840090538,"rank":86337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116198,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1369,"mean":3.3127558479532,"rank":1036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1369,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":2.7571052631579,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
