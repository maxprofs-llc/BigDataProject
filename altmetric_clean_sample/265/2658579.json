Whereas modeling and understanding of quantum confinement are well developed for conventional semiconductors, such knowledge is still lacking for 2D HOPs. In this work, concepts of effective mass and quantum well are carefully investigated and their applicability to 2D HOPs is discussed. For ultrathin layers, the effective-mass model fails. Absence of superlattice coupling and importance of non-parabolicity effects prevents the use of simple empirical models based on effective masses and envelope function approximations. An alternative method is suggested in which 2D HOPs are treated as composite materials, and a first-principles approach to the calculation of band offsets is introduced. These findings might also be relevant for other classes of layered 2D functional materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Even, Jacky","Pedesseau, Laurent","Katan, Claudine"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201402428","endpage":"3741","first_seen_on":"2014-09-05T12:36:35+00:00","issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"17","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1409920523,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201402428\/abstract;jsessionid=DDDBE60F76CA0FE8085EEC0BC1E2C2F0.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201402428\/pdf","pmid":"25196218","pubdate":"2014-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
