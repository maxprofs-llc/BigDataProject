Here we show that STIM1 expression in endothelial cells (ECs) is increased during sepsis and, therefore, contributes to hyperpermeability. LPS induced STIM1 mRNA and protein expression in human and mouse lung ECs. The induced STIM1 expression was associated with augmented SOCE as well as a permeability increase in both in vitro and in vivo models. Because activation of both the NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK signaling pathways downstream of TLR4 amplifies vascular inflammation, we studied the influence of these two pathways on LPS-induced STIM1 expression. Inhibition of either NF-\u03baB or p38 MAPK activation by pharmacological agents prevented LPS-induced STIM1 expression. Silencing of the NF-\u03baB proteins (p65\/RelA or p50\/NF-\u03baB1) or the p38 MAPK isoform p38\u03b1 prevented LPS-induced STIM1 expression and increased SOCE in ECs. In support of these findings, we found NF-\u03baB and AP1 binding sites in the 5'-regulatory region of human and mouse STIM1 genes. Further, we demonstrated that LPS induced time-dependent binding of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB (p65\/RelA) and AP1 (c-Fos\/c-Jun) to the STIM1 promoter. Interestingly, silencing of c-Fos, but not c-Jun, markedly reduced LPS-induced STIM1 expression in ECs. We also observed that silencing of p38\u03b1 prevented c-Fos expression in response to LPS in ECs, suggesting that p38\u03b1 signaling mediates the expression of c-Fos. These results support the proposal that cooperative signaling of both NF-\u03baB and AP1 (via p38\u03b1) amplifies STIM1 expression in ECs and, thereby, contributes to the lung vascular hyperpermeability response during sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Auditi DebRoy","Stephen M.
