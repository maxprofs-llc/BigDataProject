The 2462 bp cDNA for this gene contains a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding 685 amino acids with predicted M(r) = 77,507 Da. The protein sequence has approximately 60% identity with B. mori GlyRS and 45% identity with S. cerevisiae GlyRS and contains motifs 2 and 3 characteristic of Class II tRNA synthetases. A second ORF encoding 47 amino acids is found upstream of the large ORF. Translation of this ORF may precede the expression of GlyRS as a possible regulatory mechanism. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 13 kDa biotinylated tag with an apparent M(r) = 90 kDa. The fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from crude bacterial extract with human EJ serum, which contains autoantibodies directed against GlyRS, and with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of human GlyRS. Bacterial extract containing the fusion protein catalyses the aminoacylation of bovine tRNA with [14C]-gly at 10-fold increased level above normal bacterial extract and confirms that the cDNA encodes human GlyRS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["James Williams","Sarah Osvath","Tee Fern Khong","Martin Pearse","David Power"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/23.8.1307","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T20:43:55+00:00","issns":["1362-4962","0305-1048"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1336420791,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/nar\/23.8.1307","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7753621","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC306854"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/23\/8\/1307.full.pdf","pmid":"7753621","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning, sequencing and bacterial expression of human glycine tRNA synthetase.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-sequencing-bacterial-expression-human-glycine-trna-synthetase-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991404,"mean":5.0365276857663,"rank":917053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991404,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126921,"mean":9.1322635895903,"rank":38590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126921,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8257,"mean":3.1240254452926,"rank":1697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8257,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":4.6391676300578,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
