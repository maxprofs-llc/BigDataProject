In cell extracts 2-phenylethanol was oxidized by a phenazine methosulfate-dependent enzyme, probably a pyrroloquinoline quinone enzyme. Xanthobacter sp. strain 124X also contains a novel enzymatic activity designated as styrene oxide isomerase. Styrene oxide isomerase catalyzes the isomerization of styrene oxide to phenylacetaldehyde. The enzyme was partially purified and shown to have a very high substrate specificity. Of the epoxides tested, styrene oxide was the only substrate transformed. The initial step in styrene metabolism in Xanthobacter sp. strain 124X is oxygen dependent and probably involves oxidation of the aromatic nucleus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["S Hartmans","J P Smits","M J van der Werf","F Volkering","J A de Bont"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T20:06:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"11","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1194902573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16348047","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC203180"],"pmcid":"PMC203180","pmid":"16348047","pubdate":"1989-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Metabolism of Styrene Oxide and 2-Phenylethanol in the Styrene-Degrading Xanthobacter Strain 124X","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolism-styrene-oxide-2phenylethanol-styrenedegrading-xanthobacter-strain-124x"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":817732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94896,"mean":8.1107235154645,"rank":24583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94896,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3357,"mean":3.704752681764,"rank":641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3357,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":2.3023255813953,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
