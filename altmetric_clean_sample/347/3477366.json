On the basis of sequence similarity and the presence of additional domains, the superfamily can be classified into 13 branches, nine of which have known or deduced specificity for specific nitrile- or amide-hydrolysis or amide-condensation reactions. Genetic and biochemical analysis of the family members and their associated domains assists in predicting the localization, specificity and cell biology of hundreds of uncharacterized protein sequences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f610009ffb","authors":["H C Pace","C Brenner","Pace, H C","Brenner, C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T22:20:34+00:00","issns":["1465-6914","1474-760X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genome Biology (Online Edition)","last_mentioned_on":1488791613,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11380987","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC150437","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11380987"],"pmcid":"PMC150437","pmid":"11380987","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"reviews0001.1","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The nitrilase superfamily: classification, structure and function","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrilase-superfamily-classification-structure-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":2126725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5056090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244764,"mean":8.3894744385385,"rank":70939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244764,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2357,"mean":21.713432088285,"rank":1645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2357,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":33.198057142857,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
