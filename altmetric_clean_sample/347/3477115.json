The rat 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)7 receptor displays two splice variations, a long form, and a truncated splice isoform, arising from the introduction of a stop codon near the carboxy-terminus. The human-5HT7 receptor gene contains at least two introns and encodes a 445 amino acid 5-HT receptor. 2. A truncated splice variation in the human 5-HT7 receptor was isolated from a human placental cDNA library. In accordance with current NC-IUPHAR nomenclature guidelines, it is suggested that this receptor be donated as the h5-HT7b receptor and the long form of the receptor as h5-HT7a. 3. The h5-HT7b receptor was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and ligand affinities were determined by displacement of [3H]-5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT; Kd = 0.28 +\/- 0.6 nM, Bmax = 7.3 +\/- 17 pmol mg-1 protein). The rank order of affinities (pKi) for a series of ligands was: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, 9.65) > 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 9.41) > methiothepin (8.87) > mesulergine (7.87) > 8-hydroxy-2 (di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 6.85) > ketanserin (6.44). 4. The h5-HT7b receptor coupled positively to adenylyl cyclase in HEK 293 cells. This response was elicited by a number of agonists with the following order of potency (pEC50): 5-CT (8.7 +\/- 0.11) > 5-MeOT (5-methoxytryptamine; 8.1 +\/- 0.20) > 5-HT (7.5 +\/- 0.13) tryptamine (5.6 +\/- 0.36) > 8-OH-DPAT (5.3 +\/- 0.28) > 5-methoxytryptamine (5.0 +\/- 0.06). This rank order was comparable to that observed in the radioligand binding studies. 5. In a similar fashion to that described for the 5-HT7a receptor, PCR studies suggested that the 5-HT7b receptor mRNA is found in great abundance throughout the brain, in the small intestine and aorta. 6. It is concluded that the h5-HT7 receptor, like the rat receptor, exists as splice variants exhibiting similar pharmacology, signal transduction and distribution. It is thus likely that there exists a complex physiological role for alternate splicing products of the 5-HT7 receptor gene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Jasper, J.
