The HPLC analysis revealed two hydroxycinnamic-acid conjugates as major components, identified as chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) and caffeoylglucaric acid (2-O- or 5-O-caffeoyl-glucaric acid). Quantitative analyses indicated a precursor-product relationship between the chlorogenic and caffeoylglucaric acids. Protein preparations from tomato cotyledons were found to catalyze the formation of caffeoylglucaric acid with chlorogenic acid as acyl donor and free glucaric acid as acceptor molecule. This enzyme activity, possibly to be classified as hydroxycinnamoylquinic acid:glucaric acid hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, acts together with hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinic acid hydroxycinnamoyltransferase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000333b","authors":["Dieter Strack","Wiltrud Gross","Victor Wray","Lutz Grotjahn"],"doi":"10.1104\/pp.83.3.475","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T22:33:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-2548","0032-0889"],"issue":"3","journal":"Plant Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1196715454,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1104\/pp.83.3.475","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16665274","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1056389"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantphysiol.org\/content\/83\/3\/475.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1056389","pmid":"16665274","pubdate":"1987-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Enzymic Synthesis of Caffeoylglucaric Acid from Chlorogenic Acid and Glucaric Acid by a Protein Preparation from Tomato Cotyledons","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enzymic-synthesis-caffeoylglucaric-acid-chlorogenic-acid-glucaric-acid-protein-preparation-tomato-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95463,"mean":8.1888424084979,"rank":24806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95463,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":2.5509733079123,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.1840425531915,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
