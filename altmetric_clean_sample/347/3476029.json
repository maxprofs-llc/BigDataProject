For EDG7 the highest reactivity was observed with LPA with Delta9-unsaturated fatty acid (oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3)) at sn-2 followed by 2-palmitoleoyl (16:1) and 2-arachidonoyl (20:4) LPA. In contrast, EDG2 and EDG4 showed broad ligand specificities, although EDG2 and EDG4 discriminated between 14:0 (myristoyl) and 16:0 (palmitoyl), and 12:0 (lauroyl) and 14:0 LPAs, respectively. EDG7 recognizes the cis double bond at the Delta9 position of octadecanoyl residues, since 2-elaidoyl (18:1, trans) and 2-petroselinoyl (18:1, cis-Delta12) LPA were poor ligands for EDG7. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that each LPA receptor can be activated differentially by the LPA species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Bandoh, K","Aoki, J","Taira, A","Tsujimoto, M","Arai, H","Inoue, K"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0014-5793(00)01827-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T21:47:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1196052581,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0014-5793(00)01827-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10922489"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/S0014579300018275\/pdf","pmid":"10922489","pubdate":"2000-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors of the EDG family are differentially activated by LPA species.
