In vitro, serum and actinomycin D rapidly induce p23 synthesis. Using transcription inhibitors and a wheat germ cell-free translation system, evidence is provided that the synthesis of p23 is under translational control. Actinomycin D even results in superinduction of p23. Polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing of p23 cDNA suggest p23 to be identical with a 21 kDa protein of mouse erythroleukemia cells, the synthesis of which was shown to be controlled also at the translational level (Chitpatima, S.
