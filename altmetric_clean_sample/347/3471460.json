With the wild-type enzyme, (13)C isotope effects were 1.85% at C-3 and 1.5% at C-4 at pH 7, with the values increasing to 2.53 and 2.05% at pH 5.5, respectively. H97N and Y229F mutants at pH 7 gave values of 3.25 and 2.53% at C-3 and 2. 69 and 1.99% at C-4, respectively. Secondary deuterium isotope effects at C-3 were 2.5% at pH 7 and 3.1% at pH 5.5 with the wild-type enzyme, and 4.1% at pH 7 with H97N. At C-4, the corresponding values were 9.6, 14, and 19%. These data suggest that H97N shows no commitments, while the wild-type enzyme has an external commitment of approximately 1.4 at pH 7 and an internal commitment independent of pH of approximately 0.6. The Y229 mutant shows only the internal commitment of 0.6. The sequence of the epimerase is similar to those of L-fuculose-1-phosphate and L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolases for residues in the active site of L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase, suggesting that Asp76, His95, His97, and His171 of the epimerase may be metal ion ligands, and Ser44, Gly45, Ser74, and Ser75 may form a phosphate binding pocket. The pH profile of V\/K for L-ribulose 5-phosphate is bell-shaped with pK values of 5.94 and 8.24. The CD spectra of L-ribulose 5-phosphate and D-xylulose 5-phosphate differ sufficiently that the epimerization reaction can be followed at 300 nm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["L V Lee","M V Vu","W W Cleland"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T20:08:21+00:00","issns":["0006-2960"],"issue":"16","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1305448906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10769138"],"pmid":"10769138","pubdate":"2000-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"13C and deuterium isotope effects suggest an aldol cleavage mechanism for L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/13c-deuterium-isotope-effects-suggest-aldol-cleavage-mechanism-lribulose5phosphate-4epimerase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":815954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95922,"mean":8.2228602495806,"rank":25019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95922,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5465,"mean":2.4610395314788,"rank":228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5465,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":1.3329896907216,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Associate Professor":1,"Assistant Professor":1,"Post Doc":1,"Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":4,"Physics":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=429203407#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[3471458,3471460],"posted_on":"2011-05-15T08:41:46+00:00","summary":"This enzyme has a molecular mass of 102 kDa and is believed to be composed of four identical 25.5 kDa subunits.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14216020","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
