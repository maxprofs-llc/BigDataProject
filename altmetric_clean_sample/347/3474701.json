Studies with 18O-labeled acyclic precursors and H2(18)O, followed by mass spectrometric analysis of the cyclic product, confirmed that water was the sole source of the carbinol oxygen atom of endo-fenchol, thus indicating the participation of the solvent in terminating this presumptive carbocationic reaction. The isomerization component of the normally coupled reaction sequence was demonstrated directly using the substrate analog 2,3-cyclopropylgeranyl pyrosphosphate and by isolating the corresponding homoallylic analog of linalyl pyrophosphate as a major reaction product. The cyclization component of the reaction sequence was effectively dissected using linalyl pyrophosphate as substrate, and both isomerization and cyclization steps were shown to take place at the same active site of the cyclase, an observation consistent with the efficient coupling of these processes. 2-Fluorogeranyl pyrophosphate and 2-fluorolinalyl pyrophosphate were shown to be effective inhibitors of the cyclase, and the electron-withdrawing substituent was shown to greatly suppress the rate of cyclization of these labeled analogs, indicating that both steps of the coupled isomerization-cyclization sequence are initiated by ionization of an allylic pyrophosphate. Additional evidence for the electrophilic nature of the reaction was obtained by demonstrating the ability of the cyclase to solvolyze other substrate analogs which bear an allylic pyrophosphate, and by showing that cyclization was strongly inhibited by sulfonium analogs of presumptive carbocationic intermediates of the reaction sequence, especially in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphate as counterion. In spite of the fact that the fenchol cyclase terminates the cyclization with an external nucleophile (H2O), the primary mechanistic features of this isomerization-cyclization reaction are similar to those catalyzed by other cyclases that terminate the reaction by deprotonation or cation capture by the pyrophosphate moiety of the substrate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","authors":["R Croteau","J H Miyazaki","C J Wheeler"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T21:12:59+00:00","issns":["0003-9861"],"issue":"2","journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1195585019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2919880"],"pmid":"2919880","pubdate":"1989-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Monoterpene biosynthesis: mechanistic evaluation of the geranyl pyrophosphate:(-)-endo-fenchol cyclase from fennel (Foeniculum vulgare).","type":"article","volume":"269","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoterpene-biosynthesis-mechanistic-evaluation-geranyl-pyrophosphateendofenchol-cyclase-fennel-foen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":816707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95315,"mean":8.1711876534404,"rank":24743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95315,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1535,"mean":2.6025658409387,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1535,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.0928571428571,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
