The mixture was agitated gently and read at 2 minutes, at which time it was interpreted as a pure fetal blood sample or contaminated with maternal blood according to the change in colour. In order to determine the accuracy of this test to detect maternal blood contamination, the results were compared with the number of fetal and maternal cells detected by standard cytogenetic techniques in those blood samples obtained from male fetuses (n=97). Among these samples, the haemoglobin alkaline denaturation test gave an adult haemoglobin reaction in two cases (2.1 per cent); both samples showed different degrees of maternal 46,XX cells in the metaphases examined (29 of 30 cells in one case and 2 of 31 cells in the other). Conversely, of the 95 samples which gave a fetal haemoglobin reaction, the cytogenetic analysis did not reveal any maternal cells in the metaphases analysed (median 30 cells, range 20-65). We concluded that the haemoglobin alkaline denaturation test is an accurate method for excluding clinically significant maternal blood contamination of fetal blood samples obtained for prenatal karyotyping. This simple, inexpensive technique provides immediate information and, therefore, can be safely incorporated as a bedside test for analysis during fetal blood sampling procedures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b5","authors":["W Sepulveda","C Be","R Youlton","J Gutierrez","E Carstens"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T20:29:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0197-3851"],"issue":"10","journal":"Prenatal Diagnosis","last_mentioned_on":1397507060,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10521817"],"pmid":"10521817","pubdate":"1999-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Accuracy of the haemoglobin alkaline denaturation test for detecting maternal blood contamination of fetal blood samples for prenatal karyotyping.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/accuracy-haemoglobin-alkaline-denaturation-test-detecting-maternal-blood-contamination-fetal-blood-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3657903,"mean":4.9431455162044,"rank":825488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2308633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3657903,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99782,"mean":8.5442552790612,"rank":27092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":71554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99782,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":366,"mean":2.2387506849315,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":366,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.975,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=604206723#altmetric_citation_18","license":"public","citation_ids":[3472495,3472498],"posted_on":"2014-04-14T20:24:20+00:00","summary":"Percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS), also called cordocentesis, fetal blood sampling, or umbilical vein sampling is a diagnostic genetic test that examines blood from the fetal umbilical cord to detect fetal abnormalities.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13421323","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Akhan50699","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Akhan50699"}}]}}
