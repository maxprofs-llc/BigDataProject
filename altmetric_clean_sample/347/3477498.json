The actions of MCH are, so far, known to be transduced through two seven-transmembrane-like receptor paralogues, named MCH1R and MCH2R. MCH2R is not functional in rodents. MCH1R is an important receptor involved in mediating feeding behaviour modulation by MCH in rodents. Pharmacological antagonism at MCH1R in rodents diminishes food intake and results in significant and sustained weight loss in fat tissues, particularly in obese animals. Additionally, MCH1R antagonists have been shown to have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent numerous pieces of evidence showing that pharmacological blockade at MCH1R could be a potential treatment for obesity and its related metabolic syndrome, as well as for various psychiatric disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c9","doi":"10.1517\/14728222.10.2.211","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T22:23:57+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets","last_mentioned_on":1246775725,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1517\/14728222.10.2.211","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16548771"],"pmid":"16548771","pubdate":"2006-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Further insights into the neurobiology of melanin-concentrating hormone in energy and mood balances.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/further-insights-neurobiology-melaninconcentrating-hormone-energy-mood-balances"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95479,"mean":8.1901826179855,"rank":24813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95479,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":356,"mean":1.6258985915493,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":356,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4777777777778,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
