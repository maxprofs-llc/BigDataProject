Here we discuss chemical aspects of the mechanism of nyctinastic leaf movement. Nyctinastic plants from five different genera are known to contain species-specific leaf-opening and leaf-closing factors. The relative concentrations of leaf-closing and leaf-opening factors of the nyctinastic plant Phyllanthus urinaria change circadianly, suggesting that nyctinastic movement is regulated by two classes of circadianly regulated factors with opposing functions. A closing and an opening factor of Albizzia, when linked to a fluorescent dye, both specifically labeled motor cells of pluvini. A membrane fraction of pluvini contains proteins of 210 and 180 kDa that bind to a leaf-opening factor of Cassia mimosoides. The molecular identification of these proteins is underway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003330","authors":["Minoru Ueda","Yoko Nakamura"],"doi":"10.1093\/pcp\/pcm060","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T22:48:58+00:00","issns":["1471-9053"],"journal":"Plant & Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1213109893,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/pcp\/pcm060","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17566057"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pcp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/48\/7\/900.full.pdf","pmid":"17566057","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Chemical basis of plant leaf movement.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-basis-plant-leaf-movement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":817725,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94897,"mean":8.1132456794808,"rank":24584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94897,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":2.1877615176152,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.824,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
