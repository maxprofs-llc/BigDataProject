Genetic studies in mice indicate that the full repertoire of 11-cis-RDH enzymes remains to be identified. This study was conducted to characterize the 11-cis-RDH activity of RDH10 in vitro and specifically to determine whether RDH10 can functionally and physically interact with visual cycle proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Krysten M.
