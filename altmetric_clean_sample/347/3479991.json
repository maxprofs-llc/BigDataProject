In normal human tissues, the strongest immunoreactivity for 14-3-3sigma protein was observed in squamous epithelia at various sites, followed by basal cells of the trachea, bronchus and basal or myoepithelial cells of various glands. Moderate to weak 14-3-3sigma immunoreactivity was seen in the epithelial cells of the alimentary tract, gall bladder, urinary tract and endometrium. In the lung, 14-3-3sigma immunoreactivity was also observed in hyperplastic type II alveolar cells and metaplastic squamous cells. Immunohistochemical study using non-small-cell lung cancers revealed that 14-3-3sigma immunoreactivity was stronger in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas. The present study revealed that 14-3-3sigma expression was exclusively present in various epithelial cells and had a tendency to be stronger in cells destined for squamous epithelium or differentiating toward squamous cells in human normal and neoplastic cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000329e","authors":["Takashi Nakajima","Hanako Shimooka","Peng Weixa","Atsuki Segawa","Atsushi Motegi","Zhang Jian","Norihiko Masuda","Munenori Ide","Takaaki Sano","Tetsunari Oyama","Hiroe Tsukagoshi","Kozue Hamanaka","Masahiro Maeda"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T23:24:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1320-5463"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pathology International","last_mentioned_on":1197567150,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12787309"],"pmid":"12787309","pubdate":"2003-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Immunohistochemical demonstration of 14-3-3 sigma protein in normal human tissues and lung cancers, and the preponderance of its strong expression in epithelial cells of squamous cell lineage.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunohistochemical-demonstration-1433-sigma-protein-normal-human-tissues-lung-cancers-preponderance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"mean":4.9331369641107,"rank":816337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629660,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95432,"mean":8.1881051230734,"rank":24789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95432,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.7148439306358,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1571428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
