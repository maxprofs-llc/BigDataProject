Three cDNAs encoding such receptors have been isolated from Xenopus laevis (xPPAR alpha, beta, and gamma). Furthermore, the gene coding for xPPAR beta has been cloned, thus being the first member of this subfamily whose genomic organization has been solved. Functionally, xPPAR alpha as well as its mouse and rat homologs are thought to play an important role in lipid metabolism due to their ability to activate transcription of a reporter gene through the promoter of the acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) gene. ACO catalyzes the rate limiting step in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Activation is achieved by the binding of xPPAR alpha on a regulatory element (DR1) found in the promoter region of this gene, xPPAR beta and gamma are also able to recognize the same type of element and are, as PPAR alpha, able to form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor. All three xPPARs appear to be activated by synthetic peroxisome proliferators as well as by naturally occurring fatty acids, suggesting that a common mode of action exists for all the members of this subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f3c","authors":["G Krey","H Keller","A Mahfoudi","J Medin","K Ozato","C Dreyer","W Wahli"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T20:56:22+00:00","issns":["0960-0760"],"issue":"1-6","journal":"Journal of Steroid Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1216328926,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8274443"],"pmid":"8274443","pubdate":"1993-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Xenopus peroxisome proliferator activated receptors: genomic organization, response element recognition, heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor and activation by fatty acids.","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xenopus-peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptors-genomic-organization-response-element-recognitio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":817233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95163,"mean":8.1645373993822,"rank":24692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95163,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":546,"mean":2.921280733945,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":546,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.5298333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
