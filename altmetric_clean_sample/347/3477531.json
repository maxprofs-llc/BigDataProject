This study examined whether strengthening response inhibition for alcohol-related cues decreases alcohol intake. Fifty-two heavy drinking students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: In the beer\/no-go condition, participants performed a go\/no-go task that consistently paired alcohol-related stimuli with a stopping response, to increase response inhibition for alcohol-related stimuli. In the beer\/go condition, in contrast, participants were always required to respond to alcohol-related stimuli during the go\/no-go task. Before and after the go\/no-go manipulation, we measured weekly alcohol intake and implicit attitudes toward alcohol. In addition, we measured alcohol consumption during a taste test immediately after the go\/no-go manipulation. Following the manipulation, participants in the beer\/no-go condition demonstrated significantly increased negative implicit attitudes toward alcohol, and a significant reduction in weekly alcohol intake, while participants in the beer\/go condition showed a non-significant increase in implicit positive attitudes toward alcohol and a significant increase in weekly alcohol intake. This study demonstrates that repeatedly stopping prepotent responses toward alcohol-related stimuli can be an effective strategy to reduce excessive alcohol use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","doi":"10.1016\/j.drugalcdep.2010.12.011","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T22:25:09+00:00","issns":["0376-8716"],"journal":"Drug & Alcohol Dependence","last_mentioned_on":1372094438,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.drugalcdep.2010.12.011","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21288663"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.drugandalcoholdependence.com\/article\/S0376871611000329\/pdf","pmid":"21288663","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Resisting temptation: decreasing alcohol-related affect and drinking behavior by training response inhibition.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resisting-temptation-decreasing-alcoholrelated-affect-drinking-behavior-training-response-inhibition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95496,"mean":8.1914133514846,"rank":24825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95496,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1324,"mean":5.0344746787604,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1324,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.0604166666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":41,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
