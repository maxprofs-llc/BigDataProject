Previous results had shown that the unique FD epitope is carried on a common glycoprotein of approximately 90 kD, widely expressed on melanoma and a few other cell types. We now show by sequential radioimmunoprecipitation and partial amino acid sequencing that this common molecule is a previously recognized melanoma antigen, originally identified by mouse mAbs, designated gp95 or p97 (and also known as melanotransferrin). Thus, FD is the first of the class I (unique) melanoma antigens that has been characterized and related to a known cell surface molecule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["K S Furukawa","K Furukawa","F X Real","L J Old","K O Lloyd"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.169.2.585","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T19:41:21+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1540-9538","0022-1007"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1195498663,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.169.2.585","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2463331","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2189208"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/169\/2\/585.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2189208","pmid":"2463331","pubdate":"1989-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A unique antigenic epitope of human melanoma is carried on the common melanoma glycoprotein gp95\/p97","type":"article","volume":"169","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unique-antigenic-epitope-human-melanoma-carried-common-melanoma-glycoprotein-gp95p97"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":816745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96336,"mean":8.2563941039083,"rank":25222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96336,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2723,"mean":3.4232740631888,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":1645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2723,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":8.9605333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Melanotransferrin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=172534044#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3470075],"posted_on":"2007-11-19T18:57:43+00:00","summary":"Melanotransferrin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MFI2 gene.
