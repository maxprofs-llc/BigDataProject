Although located in the HLA class I region of chromosome six, the HLA-G gene may be distinguished from other HLA class I genes by its low polymorphism and alternative splicing that generates seven HLA-G proteins, whose tissue-distribution is restricted to normal fetal and adult tissues that display a tolerogeneic function toward both innate and acquired immune cells. We review these points, with special emphasis on the role of HLA-G in human pathologies, such as cancer, viral infection, and inflammatory diseases, as well as in organ transplantation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068b6","authors":["Carosella ED","Moreau P","Le Maoult J","Le Discorde M","Dausset J","Rouas-Freiss N"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T23:12:47+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Advances in Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1193708597,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14711057"],"pmid":"14711057","pubdate":"2004-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"HLA-G molecules: from maternal-fetal tolerance to tissue acceptance.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hlag-molecules-maternalfetal-tolerance-tissue-acceptance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":816186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96314,"mean":8.2409232813848,"rank":25187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96314,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":1.9702368421053,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
