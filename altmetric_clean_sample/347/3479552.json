The human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) is a short basic peptide of 36 amino acid residues. It contains six cysteines forming three intramolecular disulfide bonds. The molecular mass of hBD-1 is 3928.6 Da. Cloning of the specific cDNA confirmed the amino acid sequence of the native peptide. hBD-1 shares the nine conserved amino acids characteristic for beta-defensins from respiratory epithelial cells and neutrophils of cattle and chicken leukocytes. hBD-1 is present in nanomolar concentration in human plasma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","authors":["Bensch, K W","Raida, M","M\u00e4gert, H J","Schulz-Knappe, P","Forssmann, W G"],"doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(95)00687-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T23:15:22+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"issue":"2","journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1483997608,"links":["http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/0014-5793(95)00687-5","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(95)00687-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7628632","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7628632"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/0014579395006875\/pdf","pmid":"7628632","pubdate":"2017-01-09T21:33:32+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"hBD-1: a novel beta-defensin from human plasma.","type":"article","volume":"368","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hbd1-novel-defensin-human-plasma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":2006522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4922965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241929,"mean":8.3017451969182,"rank":69558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":166923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241929,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4202,"mean":3.038470364199,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4202,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.4641304347826,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
