PLA is a pectinase which cleaves alpha-(1-->4)-glycosidic linkages in pectin by a trans-elimination process. Using pectins with different degrees and patterns of methyl esterification, there was a significant variation in the activity rate of PLA. The enzymatic products generated at various time intervals were structurally analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine the specificity of PLA. Although the preferred substrate for PLA is fully methyl esterified polygalacturonate, cleavage was also observed with a non-methyl esterified galacturonic acid residue on either the non-reducing end or the reducing end. The current study shows that although PLA prefers fully methyl esterified substrates it can also accept partially esterified ones. It also demonstrates the suitability of ESI ion-trap mass spectrometry in determining enzyme specificities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a5","authors":["Kudzai E Mutenda","Roman K\u00f6rner","Tove M I E Christensen","J\u00f8rn Mikkelsen","Peter Roepstorff"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T21:17:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0008-6215"],"issue":"13","journal":"Carbohydrate Research","last_mentioned_on":1195590535,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12110197"],"pmid":"12110197","pubdate":"2002-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Application of mass spectrometry to determine the activity and specificity of pectin lyase A.","type":"article","volume":"337","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-mass-spectrometry-determine-activity-specificity-pectin-lyase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626939,"mean":4.9512885298875,"rank":817819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626939,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94827,"mean":8.1064425579483,"rank":24547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94827,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.9705864661654,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
