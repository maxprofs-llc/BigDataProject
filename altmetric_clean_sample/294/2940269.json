Following the discontinuation of thiotepa production in Japan, BU- and melphalan (Mel)-based regimens have been used, followed by the standard treatment for neuroblastoma. This study retrospectively analyzed 14 high-risk RB patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and hematopoietic SCT; 8 received a BU\/Mel conditioning regimen and 6 received other regimens. The disease status at HDC was relapse in 8 patients and extraocular involvement in 5. All patients received peripheral blood stem cell infusion >1.5 \u00d7 10(6)\/kg. Engraftment occurred within a median of 11 days (BU\/Mel: 10-13, others: 9-13). Primary toxicities included mucositis (\u2a7egrade 3) in 9 patients (4 with BU\/Mel, 5 with others). Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) occurred in two 1-year-old patients in the BU\/Mel group. There were no treatment-related deaths. Of 4 (2 with BU\/Mel, 2 with others) patients with central nervous system (CNS) relapse after HDC, 3 died. In conclusion, the BU\/Mel regimen may be feasible for high-risk RB under careful monitoring for VOD, particularly in younger patients. CNS relapse associated with a lethal prognosis occurred after all regimens; therefore, further evaluation of HDC efficacy for high-risk RB is required.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 1 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/bmt.2014.256.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","authors":["N Yasui","H Kawamoto","M Fujiwara","Y Aihara","C Ogawa","A Hosono","S Suzuki"],"doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2014.256","first_seen_on":"2014-12-01T22:13:41+00:00","issns":["0268-3369"," 1476-5365"],"journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1417467781,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bmt\/rss\/aop\/~3\/9TS7FBJCuIQ\/bmt.2014.256"],"pmid":"25437249","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemotherapy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer therapy","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"High-dose chemotherapy for high-risk retinoblastoma: clinical course and outcome of 14 cases in the National Cancer Center, Japan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highdose-chemotherapy-highrisk-retinoblastoma-clinical-course-outcome-14-cases-national-cancer-cente"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4570588,"mean":5.3808397682165,"rank":591496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3951256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4570588,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147058,"mean":8.2533327893267,"rank":24618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":120997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147058,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":4.2663828828829,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":8.2814814814815,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
