In this study, we established a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) to observe the beneficial effects of CNP on tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). In UUO rats, CNP administration induced a significant increase in plasma CNP levels, and caused a significant decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. In addition, CNP infusion also alleviated the pathological lesions and collagen IV accumulation in the obstructed kidneys through downregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 expression. In conclusion, exogenous CNP infusion can ameliorate UUO-induced TIF in rats. However, the use of CNP as a therapeutic agent requires further evaluation before being considered for human TIF.Laboratory Investigation advance online publication, 1 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/labinvest.2014.149.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007fd6","authors":["Peng Hu","Xiao Cen Zhang","Hai Bo Kong","Xun Xia","Bo Hu","Yuan Han Qin"],"doi":"10.1038\/labinvest.2014.149","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T10:19:01+00:00","issns":["0023-6837","1530-0307"],"journal":"Laboratory Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1417509061,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/labinvest\/rss\/aop\/~3\/aTAbBEgicRA\/labinvest.2014.149"],"pmid":"25437644","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","pathology"],"title":"Exogenous C-type natriuretic peptide infusion ameliorates unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exogenous-ctype-natriuretic-peptide-infusion-ameliorates-unilateral-ureteral-obstructioninduced-tubu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":592581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3955295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147306,"mean":8.271242130274,"rank":24638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":121219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147306,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":539,"mean":4.4093420074349,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":539,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":9.6323529411765,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Exogenous Ctype natriuretic peptide infusion ameliorates unilateral ureteral obstructioninduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rats","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/news\/article\/2155288\/Exogenous-C-type-natriuretic-peptide-infusion-ameliorates-unilateral-ureteral-obstruction-induced-tubulointerstitial.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[2942042],"posted_on":"2014-12-02T08:31:01+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}]}}
