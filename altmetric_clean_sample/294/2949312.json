Pediatr Int. 2014 Dec\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Most infants are immunologically active to develop a tolerance to oligoclonal antigens by producing IgA and introducing regulatory T cells in early infancy. Cytokines and their signalling molecules are important mediators in the intestine regulating both oral tolerance and mucosal inflammation. This system works efficiently in most individuals, but for an as yet undefined reason, some people react to food and other proteins as though they were pathogens, and induce chronic inflammation in the mucosa. The adverse reaction caused by ingested foods is defined as food intolerance. The clinical features of food intolerance include vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stool, eczema, failure to thrive, and a protean range of other symptoms. Intolerance can be divided into two categories depending on whether or not they are immunologically mediated. Food intolerance and mucosal inflammation are deeply related since tolerance cannot be introduced when there is an inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Mast cells, eosinophils, mucosal lymphocytes, and epithelial cells are deeply involved and related each other to cause mucosal inflammation. Meanwhile, rectal bleeding in infancy is related to lymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophil infiltration into the colonic mucosa facilitated by C-C motif ligand 11 (CCL11 known as eotaxin-1) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13). Rectal bleeding in infancy may not be simply caused by allergic reactions against specific antigens, but due to migrated lymphocytes to develop immunological tolerance; including IgA synthesizing, in the intestinal mucosa.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b8","authors":["Yoshikazu Ohtsuka"],"doi":"10.1111\/ped.12546","first_seen_on":"2014-12-04T10:49:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1442-200X"],"journal":"Pediatrics International","last_mentioned_on":1417689934,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25442377?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25442377","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Food intolerance and mucosal inflammation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/food-intolerance-mucosal-inflammation-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4584253,"mean":5.3814380987108,"rank":3714917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4584253,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147681,"mean":8.24506157909,"rank":115633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147681,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.0891809045226,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.4625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
