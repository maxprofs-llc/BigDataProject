The two groups were statistically similar with respect to age, sex and race. The subclavian catheters were left in for a mean of 11.5 days (2-22) while the internal jugular ones were inserted for 15.8 days (5-25; p = 0.0015). One hundred percent of the internal jugular patients were free of any venogram abnormalities in their venous access return. In marked contrast, 50% of the subclavian sites had mild to severe stricutures with 90% having 70-100% occlusion of the subclavian vein. Six patients had bilateral severe strictures. The long-term stricture rate of subclavian catheters in the subclavian vein was unacceptably high compared to the internal jugular route.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003183","authors":["G E Cimochowski","E Worley","W E Rutherford","J Sartain","J Blondin","H Harter"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T00:28:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-2766","1660-8151"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nephron Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1417612868,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2314526"],"pmid":"2314526","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Superiority of the internal jugular over the subclavian access for temporary dialysis.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superiority-internal-jugular-subclavian-access-temporary-dialysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":1927501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3067604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174319,"mean":8.0746082676489,"rank":55156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":117583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174319,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":2.1858105263158,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.3772340425532,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
