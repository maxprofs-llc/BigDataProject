Low doses toxicity is characterized by reduced weight gain. To date, the mechanisms by which this mycotoxin profoundly modifies feeding behavior remain poorly understood and more broadly the effects of T-2 toxin on the central nervous system (CNS) have received limited attention. Through an extensive characterization of sickness-like behavior induced by T-2 toxin, we showed that its per os (p.o.) administration affects not only feeding behavior but also energy expenditure, glycaemia, body temperature and locomotor activity. Using c-Fos expression mapping, we identified the neuronal structures activated in response to T-2 toxin and observed that the pattern of neuronal populations activated by this toxin resembled that induced by inflammatory signals. Interestingly, part of neuronal pathways activated by the toxin were NUCB-2\/nesfatin-1 expressing neurons. Unexpectedly, while T-2 toxin induced a strong peripheral inflammation, the brain exhibited limited inflammatory response at a time point when anorexia was ongoing. Unilateral vagotomy partly reduced T-2 toxin-induced brainstem neuronal activation. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular (icv) T-2 toxin injection resulted in a rapid (<1h) reduction in food intake. Thus, we hypothesized that T-2 toxin could signal to the brain through neuronal and\/or humoral pathways. The present work provides the first demonstration that T-2 toxin modifies feeding behavior by interfering with central neuronal networks devoted to central energy balance. Our results, with a particular attention to peripheral inflammation, strongly suggest that inflammatory mediators partake in the T-2 toxin-induced anorexia and other symptoms. In view of the broad human and breeding animal exposure to T-2 toxin, this new mechanism may lead to reconsider the impact of the consumption of this toxin on human health.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242d","authors":["St\u00e9phanie G","Mehdi D","Catherine T","Coraline A","Bernadette F","Jean A","Lebrun B","Jean-Denis T","Michel D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbi.2013.12.008","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T07:18:00+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Brain, Behavior & Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1417591011,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24355099"],"pmid":"24355099","pubdate":"2013-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","brain","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Modification of energy balance induced by the food contaminant T-2 toxin: a multimodal gut-to-brain connection.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modification-energy-balance-induced-food-contaminant-t2-toxin-multimodal-guttobrain-connection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4580192,"mean":5.3790532565391,"rank":2352144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1625676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4580192,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147346,"mean":8.2818205707694,"rank":74256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147346,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":883,"mean":6.3878616780045,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":883,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":7.9668717948718,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
