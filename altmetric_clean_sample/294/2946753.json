As for other semiconductors, it is expected that the properties of MOPs may be significantly improved by a defined nanostructure. However, their chemical sensitivity (e.g., towards hydrolysis) prohibits the application of methods already known for the synthesis of other nanomaterials. A new and general method for the synthesis of various (CH3 NH3 )PbI3 nanostructures from a novel single-source precursor is presented. Nanoporous MOP single crystals are obtained by a crystal-to-crystal transformation that is accompanied by spinodal demixing of the triethylene glycol containing precursor structure. Selective binding of a capping agent can be used to tune the particle shape of the MOP nanocrystals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Kollek, Tom","Gruber, Dominik","Gehring, Julia","Zimmermann, Eugen","Schmidt\u2010Mende, Lukas","Polarz, Sebastian"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201408713","endpage":"1346","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T17:28:32+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"4","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
