A nonsystematic search of the PubMed\/Medline database was performed. The congenital disorders were classified in 3 groups of malformation: ventral induction disorders, cortical malformations, and congenital malformations of the posterior fossa. The highlights of genotype-imaging phenotype correlation of some congenital malformations are provided. It is hoped that developments in genotype-MR phenotype in CMCNS will foster further prognostic and pathogenic breakthroughs for the frequently associated neurologic dysfunction in children affected by these common diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b58","doi":"10.1016\/j.nic.2014.09.003","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T02:03:59+00:00","issns":["1052-5149"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuroimaging clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1417497797,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=nic-site&rc=6&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neuroimaging.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS1052-5149%252814%252900083-5%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.neuroimaging.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS1052-5149%252814%252900083-5%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=nic-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neuroimaging.theclinics.com\/article\/S1052514914000835\/pdf","pmid":"25476512","pubdate":"2015-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"53","subjects":["diagnosticimaging","neurology"],"title":"Brain Imaging and Genetic Risk in the Pediatric Population, Part 2","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-imaging-genetic-risk-pediatric-population-part-2-congenital-malformations-central-nervous-syst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":3708237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147308,"mean":8.2369310351851,"rank":115440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147308,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.1012195121951,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.29166666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
