WAG\/Rij rats are known to have a genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy, and further development of epilepsy might be influenced by epigenetic factors. This preliminary study examined the effect of early postnatal factors on the incidence of epileptic spike-wave discharges in adulthood. The newborn WAG\/Rij rats were fostered by Wistar dams (from birth throughout the weaning age), and their EEG was examined continuously from 5 to 13 months of age. It was found that the number and duration of absence seizures was reduced in WAG\/Rij rats adopted by Wistar dams as compared with the age-matched control WAG\/Rij rats nursed by their own mothers. These data indicate that natural (epigenetic) factors, such as maternal care during suckling period, affect development of seizure activity in genetically prone subjects. It is suggested that improvement of primarily care-giving environment in subjects with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy is a way to reduce epileptic activity in later life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Evgenia Sitnikova","Elizaveta M Rutskova","Vladimir V Raevsky"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2014.10.067","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T11:12:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-6240"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1438769684,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25449890?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25449890","pubdate":"2014-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Reduction of epileptic spike-wave activity in WAG\/Rij rats fostered by Wistar dams.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduction-epileptic-spikewave-activity-wagrij-rats-fostered-wistar-dams"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446775,"mean":6.3436252636902,"rank":4532720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446775,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185372,"mean":8.0858530406592,"rank":146493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185372,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2788,"mean":3.4402655184786,"rank":2351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":3.855619047619,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
