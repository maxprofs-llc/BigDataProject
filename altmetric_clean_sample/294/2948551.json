For example, gain during smooth tracking is reduced, and fixation patterns differ between patients and healthy controls. The question remains, whether such results are related to the specifics of the experimental environment, or whether they transfer to natural settings. Twenty ICD-10 diagnosed schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy age-matched controls participated in the study, each performing four different oculomotor tasks corresponding to natural everyday behavior in an indoor environment: (I) fixating stationary targets, (II) sitting in a hallway with free gaze, (III) walking down the hallway, and (IV) visually tracking a target on the floor while walking straight-ahead. In all conditions, eye movements were continuously recorded binocularly by a mobile lightweight eye tracker (EyeSeeCam). When patients looked at predefined targets, they showed more fixations with reduced durations than controls. The opposite was true when participants were sitting in a hallway with free gaze. During visual tracking, patients showed a significantly greater root-mean-square error (representing the mean deviation from optimal) of retinal target velocity. Different from previous results on smooth-pursuit eye movements obtained in laboratory settings, no such difference was found for velocity gain. Taken together, we have identified significant differences in fundamental oculomotor parameters between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during natural behavior in a real environment. Moreover, our data provide evidence that in natural settings, patients overcome some impairments, which might be present only in laboratory studies, by as of now unknown compensatory mechanisms or strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002815","authors":["Stefan Dowiasch","Bianca Backasch","Wolfgang Einh\u00e4user","Dirk Leube","Tilo Kircher","Frank Bremmer"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00406-014-0567-8","first_seen_on":"2014-12-04T05:53:34+00:00","issns":["1433-8491"],"journal":"European Archives of Psychiatry & Clinical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1417778120,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00406-014-0567-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25472882?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00406-014-0567-8.pdf","pmid":"25472882","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Eye movements of patients with schizophrenia in a natural environment.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eye-movements-patients-schizophrenia-natural-environment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4586246,"mean":5.382841503168,"rank":3137577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":869624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4586246,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147764,"mean":8.2260722643694,"rank":98726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147764,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":2.910971722365,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.5138888888889,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
