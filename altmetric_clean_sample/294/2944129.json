These two groups were not statistically different as regards age (61.6 +\/- 11.3 years in the first and 61 +\/- 11.1 in the second), sex (48% and 56% were women), duration of catheter insertion (31 +\/- 21.8 and 31.7 +\/- 16 days), and the number of dialysis sessions (13.5 +\/- 9.1 and 13.6 +\/- 7.1). The type of catheters, the frequency of removal for poor flow (16% in both groups) or infections (6% in both groups), and the local nursing were similar in the two groups. The only difference was the side of cannulation: the right side in 58% of cases in group 1 and 78% in group 2. The angiographic study revealed a stenosis of the vein in 42% of the subclavian group and in 10% of the internal jugular group: a dramatic difference in favour of the internal jugular route, whose superiority over the subclavian route is asserted in respect of venous access of dialysed patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317f","authors":["F Schillinger","D Schillinger","R Montagnac","T Milcent","Schillinger, F","Schillinger, D","Montagnac, R","Milcent, T"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T00:28:35+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0931-0509"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1502041782,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1754109","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1754109?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"1754109","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Post catheterisation vein stenosis in haemodialysis: comparative angiographic study of 50 subclavian and 50 internal jugular accesses.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/post-catheterisation-vein-stenosis-haemodialysis-comparative-angiographic-study-50-subclavian-50-int"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.35,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1773061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6546835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240731,"mean":7.6965325800691,"rank":53945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":186336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240731,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2548,"mean":4.2340384766392,"rank":526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":2013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2548,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":3.3344444444444,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
