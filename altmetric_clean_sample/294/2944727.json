Starting with a \"conventional\" superconducting phase of this material under high pressure leads to an unexpected phase transition toward a semiconducting one. This transition occurred at 53.7 GPa, and this pressure acts as a demarcation between two distinct crystal symmetries, metallic orthorhombic and semiconducting tetragonal phases, with Pnnm and I41\/acd space groups, respectively. In this work, the electron-phonon coupling-derived superconducting Tc has been determined up to 60 GPa and along with optical band gap variation with increasing pressure up to 300 GPa. The dynamic stability has been confirmed by phonon dispersion calculations throughout this study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Komsilp Kotmool","Thanayut Kaewmaraya","Sudip Chakraborty","Jonas Anversa","Thiti Bovornratanaraks","Wei Luo","Huiyang Gou","Paulo Cesar Piquini","Tae Won Kang","Ho-kwang Mao","Rajeev Ahuja"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1419244111","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T03:40:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"48","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1417546854,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/48\/17050.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/48\/17050.full.pdf","pmid":"25404295","pubdate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"17050","subjects":["science"],"title":"Revealing an unusual transparent phase of superhard iron tetraboride under high pressure","type":"article","volume":"111","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revealing-unusual-transparent-phase-superhard-iron-tetraboride-under-high-pressure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":3708228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147120,"mean":8.2407861934897,"rank":115308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147120,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37669,"mean":16.125154667091,"rank":34557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37669,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":941,"mean":46.064906382979,"rank":872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":941,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
