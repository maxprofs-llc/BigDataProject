Self-reported alcohol use is frequently under-reported due to social desirability and recall bias. The aim of this study was to compare self-reported alcohol consumption to phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a biomarker of alcohol consumption, and to estimate the correlation between multiple measures of self-reported alcohol consumption with PEth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Francis Bajunirwe","Jessica E Haberer","Yap Boum","Peter Hunt","Rain Mocello","Jeffrey N Martin","David R Bangsberg","Judith A Hahn","Bajunirwe F","Haberer JE","Boum Y 2nd","Hunt P","Mocello R","Martin JN","Bangsberg DR","Hahn JA"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0113152","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T22:41:15+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1442935744,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25436894?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25436894","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e113152","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Comparison of Self-Reported Alcohol Consumption to Phosphatidylethanol Measurement among HIV-Infected Patients Initiating Antiretroviral Treatment in Southwestern Uganda.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-selfreported-alcohol-consumption-phosphatidylethanol-measurement-among-hivinfected-patien-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6387920,"mean":5.8563669304503,"rank":3011428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1914612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6387920,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192441,"mean":8.0279025566413,"rank":96822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":72828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192441,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97435,"mean":9.6919505716691,"rank":55925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97435,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2596,"mean":14.679774181118,"rank":1563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2596,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
