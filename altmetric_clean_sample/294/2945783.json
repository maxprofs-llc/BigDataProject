Methods: One hundred elderly patients who underwent upper extremity surgery were randomly assigned to received isolated Intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia (group CI, n\u00a0=\u00a050) and IBPB associated with Intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia (group NB, n\u00a0=\u00a050). Associated side effects, recovery time after operation, as well as the dose of intraoperative vasoactive agents and auxiliary drugs were noted. Results: The two groups were not significantly different in gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.539), ages (P\u00a0=\u00a00.683) and weight (P\u00a0=\u00a00.212). Five patients (10%) in the group NB and 17 patients (34%) in the group CI suffered from preoperative hypotension (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Besides, lower incidence of other adverse effects such as mental stress, incision pain and hypertension were also found in the group NB; however, the differences were not statistically significant (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The consumption of general anesthetics in the group NB was significantly less than that of the group CI (propofol, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004; lsoflurane, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the recovery time of the group NB was significantly shorter than that of the group CI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020). Conclusion: Combining IBPB with Intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia in elderly patients hold a greater potential for upper extremity fractures surgery due to its improved clinical effectiveness and fewer side effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Lan Yuan","Wei Tang","Guo-Qiang Fu","Jian Wang","Jun Guo","Wen-Ting Chen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2014.10.011","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T11:12:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-9159"],"issue":"12","journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1435140853,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25448672?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25448672","pubdate":"2014-10-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Combining interscalene brachial plexus block with intravenous-inhalation combined anesthesia for upper extremity fractures surgery: A randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combining-interscalene-brachial-plexus-block-intravenousinhalation-combined-anesthesia-upper-extremi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5273623,"mean":6.2055491940853,"rank":2773072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2476209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5273623,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181609,"mean":8.0819380644026,"rank":90506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":90072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181609,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":2.1139325842697,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.4161204819277,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
