The increased emphasis stems from the improved understanding of the multifaceted role that inflammation may play in disrupting both biologic and abiologic components of the overall neural interface circuit. To combat neuro-inflammation and improve recording quality, the field is actively progressing from traditional inorganic materials towards approaches that either minimizes the microelectrode footprint or that incorporate compliant materials, bioactive molecules, conducting polymers or nanomaterials. However, the immune-privileged cortical tissue introduces an added complexity compared to other biomedical applications that remains to be fully understood. This review provides a comprehensive reflection on the current understanding of the key failure modes that may impact intracortical microelectrode performance. In addition, a detailed overview of the current status of various materials-based approaches that have gained interest for neural interfacing applications is presented, and key challenges that remain to be overcome are discussed. Finally, we present our vision on the future directions of materials-based treatments to improve intracortical microelectrodes for neural interfacing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8e","authors":["Mehdi Jorfi","John L Skousen","Christoph Weder","Jeffrey R Capadona","Jorfi M","Skousen JL","Weder C","Capadona JR"],"doi":"10.1088\/1741-2560\/12\/1\/011001","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T16:57:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1741-2552","1741-2560"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Neural Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1419907664,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1741-2552\/12\/1\/011001#.VH3sQ2PUAwA.twitter","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1741-2552\/12\/1\/011001","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/1741-2552\/12\/1\/011001#.VIW9hUVodZQ.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/beta.iopscience.iop.org\/1741-2552\/12\/1\/011001\/pdf\/1741-2552_12_1_011001.pdf","pmid":"25460808","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"011001","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","neurology"],"title":"Progress towards biocompatible intracortical microelectrodes for neural interfacing applications","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/progress-towards-biocompatible-intracortical-microelectrodes-neural-interfacing-applications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6324436,"mean":5.9767388233103,"rank":1166563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5150033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6324436,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197979,"mean":7.8147670549254,"rank":43693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":153978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197979,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":8.9840043859649,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.2505,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":18,"Student  > Ph.
