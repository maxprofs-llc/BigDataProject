Additionally, sEMG recordings were analyzed for one chronic SCI individual before electrical stimulation (ES), after ES of the lower extremities while supine, and after active stand training using body-weight support with bilateral ES. sEMG recordings were collected on bilateral erector spinae, internal and external obliques, upper and middle trapezius, biceps and triceps. For each maneuver a voluntary response index was calculated: incorporating the magnitude of sEMG signal and a similarity index (SI), which quantifies the distribution of activity across all muscles.Results:Among all maneuvers, the SI presented reproducible assessment of trunk-motor function within (ICC: 0.860-0.997) and among (P\u2a7e0.22) able-bodied individuals. In addition, potential changes were measured in a chronic SCI individual after undergoing two intensive ES protocols.Conclusion:The BMCA provides reproducible characterization of trunk activity in able-bodied individuals, lending credence for its use in neurophysiological assessment of motor control. Additionally, the BMCA as an assessment tool to measure neurorecovery in an individual with chronic SCI after intense ES interventions was demonstrated.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 2 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/sc.2014.171.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a6","authors":["M D Mitchell","M B Yarossi","D N Pierce","E L Garbarini","G F Forrest"],"doi":"10.1038\/sc.2014.171","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T08:54:43+00:00","issns":["1362-4393","1476-5624"],"journal":"Spinal Cord","last_mentioned_on":1417592582,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/sc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/vAeeHyc7KV4\/sc.2014.171"],"pmid":"25448189","pubdate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Skeletal muscle","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Reliability of surface EMG as an assessment tool for trunk activity and potential to determine neurorecovery in SCI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reliability-surface-emg-assessment-tool-trunk-activity-potential-determine-neurorecovery-sci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4580192,"mean":5.3790532565391,"rank":593255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3959081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4580192,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147349,"mean":8.2809649401418,"rank":24645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":121256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147349,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":4.7655274542429,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":7.6250714285714,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
