Commercial grape juice at both natural and neutral pH inactivate various enteric viruses and herpes simplex virus; a 1,000-fold reduction in poliovirus infectivity occurred after incubation with grape juice, pH 7.0, for 24 h at 4 degrees C. A variety of wines were antiviral but to a lesser extent than grape juice; red wines were more antiviral than white. Antiviral activity was demonstrable in fractions of grape juice varying in molecular weight from less than 1,000 to greater than 30,000 as determined by membrane filtration. Some restoration of poliovirus infectivity from virus-grape juice complexes was achieved with 1% gelatin, 0.1% Tween 80, 0.5% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and 0.5% polyethylene glycol.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["J Konowalchuk","J I Speirs"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-04T09:37:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"6","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1417685894,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC170457\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC170457\/pdf\/aem00011-0035.pdf","pmcid":"PMC170457","pmid":"12719","pubdate":"1976-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"757","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Virus inactivation by grapes and wines.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/virus-inactivation-grapes-wines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4584253,"mean":5.3814380987108,"rank":3714910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4584253,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147682,"mean":8.2448547477334,"rank":115632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147682,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4159,"mean":4.2183737373737,"rank":3476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4159,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":8.162,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
