We examine policy modifications implemented by the North Carolina State Health Plan. We investigate whether incentives produce the desired plan elections and whether these changes, along with cost shifting, produce the expected reductions in cost growth. Using individual-level administrative data, along with aggregated data on expenditures for retirees, we estimate the effects of the introduction and subsequent repeal of a Comprehensive Wellness Initiative for non-Medicare eligible retirees, as well as increases in coinsurance and copayments and the introduction of a premium for all retirees. Over a third of non-Medicare retirees shifted into the least generous plan between June 2009 and December 2012. The level effects on annual costs and unfunded accrued liabilities were relatively modest, but growth rates were diminished. Increases in the retiree premiums reduced the state's projected costs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd1","doi":"10.1016\/j.jhealeco.2014.02.007","first_seen_on":"2014-12-03T16:07:05+00:00","issns":["01676296"],"journal":"Journal of Health Economics","last_mentioned_on":1417622723,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0167629614000290&_version=1&md5=7c4ea32ba80a5f9c6509ce2189da9ce4"],"pmid":"25479892","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The effects of retiree health insurance plan characteristics on retirees\u2019 choice and employers\u2019 costs ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-retiree-health-insurance-plan-characteristics-retirees-choice-employers-costs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4580192,"mean":5.3790532565391,"rank":3711810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":141288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4580192,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147351,"mean":8.2837380251104,"rank":115450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147351,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":7.2403951473137,"rank":507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":5.3008571428571,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
