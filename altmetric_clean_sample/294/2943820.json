In these cases, additional measures or a modification to our dental treatment need to be taken. We are aware of various diseases that can cause the emergence of bacterial endocarditis (BE), such as; rheumatic fever, valve lesions due to intravenous drug use, Kawasaki disease and valve surgery, among others. Due to its severity when it is not taken into account in dental treatment, we intend to show the evolution of the antimicrobial prophylaxis towards this condition. Furthermore, we intend to publish the current guidelines of institutions and societies which increasingly encourage rational antimicrobial use. In addition, we intend to examine the evidence of the possible origins of this disease during dental treatment and at the same time describe the necessary considerations that need to be taken during dental treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Mang-de la Rosa MR","Castellanos-Cosano L","Romero-Perez MJ","Cutando A"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T22:19:44+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral y Cirugia Bucal","last_mentioned_on":1417558742,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24121925?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24121925","pubdate":"2013-10-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"The bacteremia of dental origin and its implications in the appearance of bacterial endocarditis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bacteremia-dental-origin-implications-appearance-bacterial-endocarditis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4575816,"mean":5.3764004311399,"rank":3130255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":867768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4575816,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147309,"mean":8.236841013387,"rank":98469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":31873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147309,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":1.4445284552846,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.35416666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
