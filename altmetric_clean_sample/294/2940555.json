As smoking prevalence is higher among lower income people than among higher income people in Korea, the regressivity of cigarette excise taxes is often cited as a barrier to tobacco tax and price policy. While studies in several other high-income countries have shown that higher income individuals are less price sensitive, few studies have examined the differential impact of cigarette tax increases by income group in Korea. Most of the Korean literature has estimated the demand for cigarettes using time-series aggregate sales data or household level survey data, which record household cigarette expenditures rather than individual cigarette consumption. Studies using survey data often lack time-series variation and estimate cigarette demand using household expenditure data, while studies using time-series aggregate sales data lack cross-sectional variation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003670","authors":["Seng Eun Choi"],"doi":"10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2014-051680","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T00:57:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3318","0964-4563"],"issue":"2","journal":"Tobacco Control","last_mentioned_on":1497893659,"links":["http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/27\/tobaccocontrol-2014-051680.full","http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/25\/2\/141.full","http:\/\/m.tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/25\/2\/141.full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2014-051680","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25430738"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2014\/11\/27\/tobaccocontrol-2014-051680.full.pdf","pmid":"25430738","pubdate":"2014-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"tobaccocontrol-2014-051680","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Are lower income smokers more price sensitive?: the evidence from Korean cigarette tax increases","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lower-income-smokers-more-price-sensitive-evidence-korean-cigarette-tax-increases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":961891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7428663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241605,"mean":7.7026438800684,"rank":32627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":208898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241605,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1869,"mean":19.698683083512,"rank":660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1869,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":23.719294117647,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
