The anti-inflammatory effects of calcium citrate were investigated by assessing pro-inflammatory factors (NO, ROS, NF-\u03baB, iNOS, and COX-2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1). Treatment of cells with calcium citrate (10-100\u03bcM) significantly reduced the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Calcium citrate was further shown to inhibit NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7cells. The expression levels of iNOS, COX-2, and NF-\u03baB were also suppressed by treatment with calcium citrate. Calcium citrate was furthermore found to significantly inhibit the production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in response to LPS-stimulation. These findings demonstrate that calcium citrate may be an effective anti-inflammatory agent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f1","authors":["Eun-Young Choi","Hak-Ju Kim","Ji-Sook Han","Choi EY","Kim HJ","Han JS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etap.2014.11.002","endpage":"34","first_seen_on":"2014-12-02T23:38:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7077","1382-6689","13826689"],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1471280965,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25434759?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25434759"],"pmid":"25434759","pubdate":"2014-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Science And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"27","subjects":["environmentalhealth","pharmacology"],"title":"Anti-inflammatory effects of calcium citrate in RAW 264.7cells via suppression of NF-\u03baB activation.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiinflammatory-effects-calcium-citrate-raw-2647cells-via-suppression-nfb-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":5949011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1977824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240028,"mean":7.684573210514,"rank":145301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":81847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240028,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":488,"mean":3.6897700205339,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":488,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.4333333333333,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
