Data on 189 male callers were collected from the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service Spanish-language call center. Most participants were willing to vaccinate their adolescent son (87.5%) or daughter (78.8%) against HPV. However, among this sample, awareness of HPV was low and knowledge of key risk factors varied. These findings can help guide the development of culturally informed educational efforts aimed at increasing informed decision-making about HPV vaccination among Hispanic fathers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005e77","authors":["Julie Kornfeld","Margaret M.
