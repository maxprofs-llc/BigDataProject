Clinical communication around diabetes can be especially challenging when language barriers are present, and may contribute to poor diabetes management and outcomes. Clinicians need to be aware of and address potential communication difficulties associated with interpreter-mediated consultations. The purpose of our study was to explore how physicians communicate in interpreter-mediated consultations with diabetic patients, and how their communication behaviors may impact diabetes communication and care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b6","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2296-14-163","first_seen_on":"2013-10-23T23:44:57+00:00","issns":["1471-2296"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Family Practice","last_mentioned_on":1384515671,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/14\/163\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2296-14-163.pdf","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2296\/14\/163"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2296-14-163.pdf","pmid":"24152539","pubdate":"2013-10-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"163","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Interpreter-mediated diabetes consultations: a qualitative analysis of physician communication practices","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interpretermediated-diabetes-consultations-qualitative-analysis-physician-communication-practices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1651534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2823346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101684,"mean":7.7216337244183,"rank":32205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":68729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101684,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":769,"mean":3.7655078125,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":769,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.9313333333333,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
