The purpose of this study was to determine whether analysis of isotopic and fatty acid (FA) profiles could provide more comprehensive information to discriminate between three categories of wild food consumption (that is, plants and animals) in two isolated First Nations communities of northwestern Ontario. In addition, this analysis also highlights whether wild food consumption as practiced in these two communities can increase circulating levels of polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), which provide a number of important metabolic benefits that could impact the prevention\/treatment of T2DM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc57","authors":["T Seabert","S Pal","E M Kr|[uuml]|mmel","J M Blais","P Imbeault","M A Robidoux","F Haman"],"doi":"10.1038\/nutd.2013.34","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-10-23T13:44:16+00:00","issns":["false"],"journal":"Nutrition diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1382535847,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nutd\/journal\/v3\/n10\/full\/nutd201334a.html"],"pmid":"24145576","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e92","title":"Dietary practices in isolated First Nations communities of northern Canada: combined isotopic and lipid markers provide a good qualitative assessment of store-bought vs locally harvested foods consumption","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-practices-isolated-first-nations-communities-northern-canada-combined-isotopic-lipid-markers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101684,"mean":7.7256402151788,"rank":68079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101684,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":13.696566037736,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
