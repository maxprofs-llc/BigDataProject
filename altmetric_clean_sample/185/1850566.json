Verruciform xanthoma (VX)-like histologic changes occasionally occur in CHILD syndrome, but typical VX-like lesions coexisting with CHILD syndrome are rare. In this study we report a rare case of multiple, coexisting VXs on the vulva and left lower limb of an 11-year-old Chinese girl who also exhibited the typical clinical presentations and limb defects of CHILD syndrome. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the lesions were typical VXs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac","authors":["Xu, Xiu\u2010Lian","Huang, Li\u2010Ming","Wang, Qiang","Sun, Jian\u2010Fang"],"doi":"10.1111\/pde.12198","endpage":"137","first_seen_on":"2013-10-23T00:59:52+00:00","issns":["1525-1470","0736-8046"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1382422668,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.12198\/abstract;jsessionid=DD687E708B6771EEFC1DB5AB492F47FC.f02t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.12198\/pdf","pmid":"24147604","pubdate":"2013-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"135","subjects":["dermatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Multiple Verruciform Xanthomas in the Setting of Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosiform Erythroderma and Limb Defects Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-verruciform-xanthomas-setting-congenital-hemidysplasia-ichthyosiform-erythroderma-limb-defe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6294277,"mean":5.9778739232289,"rank":4652073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":941251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6294277,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114079,"mean":7.8321350479497,"rank":75845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":20557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114079,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":529,"mean":2.3842803030303,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":529,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.2115384615385,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Allergy_London\/status\/392535237936558080","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1850566],"posted_on":"2013-10-22T06:17:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Doctor@UKallergy.com","url":"http:\/\/www.UKallergy.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784144530207608832\/k-LKiKOU_normal.jpg","description":"Allergy, Immunology, Dermatology, Paediatrics, Ear Nose Throat clinics.
