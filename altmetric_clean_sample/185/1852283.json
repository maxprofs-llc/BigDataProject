Children in lower-income households are at higher risk for obesity, but there is little information about their mothers' perceptions of family meals, and such information could improve nutrition counseling. To identify the perceived benefits and challenges of having family meals, four focus groups were conducted with 20 mothers of preschool-aged children living in low-income households in Philadelphia, PA. Three authors independently analyzed verbatim transcripts using an inductive method of open coding, and themes were established by consensus among all authors. Of the 20 mothers, 18 were black, 11 had education beyond high school, and 12 were living with an adult partner or husband. Mothers' strong childhood memories of mealtimes, both negative and positive, motivated them to have family meals because of the opportunities afforded by mealtimes to build strong relationships with their children. However, mothers also described needing help, especially from other household adults, in preparing meals and establishing calm and order with their children during mealtimes. To identify what motivates the mothers of low-income, preschool-aged children to have family meals, registered dietitians can benefit from asking about the mothers' own childhood experiences of family meals. Studies are needed to examine whether such an approach to identifying maternal motivations, when combined with practical advice about overcoming challenges with meal preparation and managing children's mealtime behavior, could lead to more frequent and nutritious family meals in this population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["Malhotra, Khushi","Herman, Allison N.","Wright, Gretchen","Bruton, Yasmeen","Fisher, Jennifer O.","Whitaker, Robert C."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jand.2013.07.028","first_seen_on":"2013-10-23T08:05:11+00:00","issns":["2212-2672"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","last_mentioned_on":1444913448,"links":["http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S2212-2672(13)01184-2\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24144074"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S2212-2672(13)01184-2\/pdf","pmid":"24144074","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Perceived benefits and challenges for low-income mothers of having family meals with preschool-aged children: childhood memories matter.","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceived-benefits-challenges-lowincome-mothers-having-family-meals-preschoolaged-children-childhood"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":4863991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":965494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117233,"mean":7.7563988672036,"rank":77716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":20874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117233,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":742,"mean":18.551721997301,"rank":608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":742,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":22.187161290323,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
