However, in order to achieve sub-nanometre resolution it is often necessary to capture and process many thousands or even several millions of 2D particle images. Thus, a computational bottleneck in reaching high resolution is the accurate and automatic picking of particles from raw cryo-electron micrographs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000799","doi":"10.1186\/1472-6807-13-25","first_seen_on":"2013-10-22T23:04:34+00:00","issns":["1472-6807"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1386169001,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6807\/13\/25\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6807-13-25.pdf","pmid":"24144335","pubdate":"2013-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"25","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"gEMpicker: A Highly Parallel GPU-Accelerated Particle Picking Tool for Cryo-Electron Microscopy","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gempicker-highly-parallel-gpuaccelerated-particle-picking-tool-cryoelectron-microscopy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":1811415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1638963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95421,"mean":7.6756729616434,"rank":43374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":46843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95421,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.8873269230769,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.3713333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
