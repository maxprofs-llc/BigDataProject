The authors developed a 3-phase approach to central venous catheter placement training, including an online module, mannequin-based simulation using a single faculty member, followed by department directed clinical observation. The hypothesis was that standardizing institutional central venous catheter placement training would maintain training efficiency and reduce faculty and resource demands.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["David E.
