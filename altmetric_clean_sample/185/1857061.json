Limited sequence data and rapid divergence rates have precluded consensus on the evolutionary placement of gnetophytes based on molecular characters. Here we report on the first complete gnetophyte chloroplast genome sequence, from Welwitschia mirabilis, as well as analyses on divergence rates of protein-coding genes, comparisons of gene content and order, and phylogenetic implications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-8-130","first_seen_on":"2013-10-24T19:55:26+00:00","issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1382644469,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/8\/130","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-8-130","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18452621","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2386820"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2148-8-130.pdf","pmid":"18452621","pubdate":"2008-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/ Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"130","subjects":["biology"],"title":"The complete plastid genome sequence of Welwitschia mirabilis: an unusually compact plastome with accelerated divergence rates","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-plastid-genome-sequence-welwitschia-mirabilis-unusually-compact-plastome-accelerated-diverg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927596,"mean":5.0186418921905,"rank":3134972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":96800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927596,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97869,"mean":7.6629857252339,"rank":77726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97869,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1248,"mean":6.9107457898957,"rank":1074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":7.3030169491525,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
