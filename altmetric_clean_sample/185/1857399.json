This hypothesis also suggests that pharmacotherapy partly acts in depression through anti-inflammatory effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, promising, non-invasive somatic treatment for depression, although its antidepressant mechanisms are only partly understood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Andr\u00e9 R Brunoni","Rodrigo Machado-Vieira","Carlos A Zarate","Leandro Valiengo","Erica Lm Vieira","Isabela M Bense\u00f1or","Paulo A Lotufo","Wagner F Gattaz","Antonio L Teixeira","Andr\u00e9 R.
