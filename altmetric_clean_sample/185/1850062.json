Despite this, MM remains an incurable disease. Elderly patients (\u226565 years) represent the majority of subjects. Differently from younger (<65 years) and fit patients, elderly patients are usually not eligible for transplantation. Gentler approaches with novel agents plus conventional chemotherapy with melphalan-prednisone are commonly adopted in this setting. Data show that a sequential approach including induction followed by consolidation\/maintenance therapy is an optimal strategy to improve patient outcome. In addition, second-generation novel agents are currently under investigation and may represent valuable alternative treatment options in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cd5","authors":["Chiara Cerrato","Antonio Palumbo"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.seminoncol.2013.07.003","first_seen_on":"2013-10-22T22:48:02+00:00","issns":["1532-8708"],"issue":"5","journal":"Seminars in oncology","last_mentioned_on":1382455686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24135402"],"pmid":"24135402","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Initial treatment of nontransplant patients with multiple myeloma.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/initial-treatment-nontransplant-patients-multiple-myeloma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3554966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":835227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107403,"mean":7.8358049943207,"rank":71683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":19199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107403,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":2.1694676258993,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0498461538462,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
