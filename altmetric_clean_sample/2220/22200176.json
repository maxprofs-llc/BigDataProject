The objective of the study was to explore the associations between early age at natural menopause (menopause at an age\u226445years) and the presence of CHD and stroke.\nThe study subjects were from the first follow-up survey of the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study. A total of 16,515 postmenopausal women were included for the analysis. Logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between age at natural menopause (\u226445, 45-52, >52years) and the presence of CHD and stroke adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, reproductive history and metabolic factors.\nIn the fully adjusted model, for each 1-year delay in menopausal age, the prevalence of CHD and stroke was reduced by 3% (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98) and 5% (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98), respectively. Women with early menopause (\u226445years) had a higher prevalence of CHD (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57) compared with those with menopause at ages 45-52years. Similarly, women with early menopause (\u226445years) was associated with higher prevalence of stroke (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.25-2.30) compared with those with menopause at ages 45-52years.\nEarly age at natural menopause is significantly associated with the presence of CHD and stroke among Chinese women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Lijun Shen","Lulu Song","Bingqing Liu","Hui Li","Xiaoxuan Zheng","Lina Zhang","Jing Yuan","Yuan Liang","Youjie Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2017.03.127","first_seen_on":"2017-07-19T15:13:23+00:00","issns":["01675273"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1500477173,"links":["http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167-5273(16)33287-9\/abstract"],"pmid":"28392079","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Effects of early age at natural menopause on coronary heart disease and stroke in Chinese women","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-early-age-natural-menopause-coronary-heart-disease-stroke-chinese-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8244534,"mean":6.9679504076153,"rank":1198089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6971971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8244534,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167276,"mean":11.677019710058,"rank":33043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":133311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167276,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3768,"mean":3.1978683302363,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3768,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.1061290322581,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
