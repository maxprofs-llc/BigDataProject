Here we describe an NMR-based competition assay using (19)F-containing reporter molecules, which allows for rapid identification and discrimination between ATP-competitive and allosteric kinase inhibitors. We illustrate the principle of such a dual-site competition assay with the example of catalytic and allosteric ABL1 kinase inhibitors. The assay can also be used to identify and characterize mixed binding modes of well-known drugs, as shown for crizotinib and fingolimod.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006815","authors":["Lukasz Skora","Wolfgang Jahnke"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsmedchemlett.7b00084","first_seen_on":"2017-07-19T17:16:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-5875"],"issue":"6","journal":"ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1502978424,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/acsmedchemlett.7b00084","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acsmedchemlett.7b00084#.WZWhY7AvI6Q.twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5467191","pmid":"28626524","pubdate":"2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"title":"19F-NMR-Based Dual-Site Reporter Assay for the Discovery and Distinction of Catalytic and Allosteric Kinase Inhibitors","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/19fnmrbased-dualsite-reporter-assay-discovery-distinction-catalytic-allosteric-kinase-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.62,"score_history":{"1y":11.62,"6m":11.62,"3m":11.62,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.62},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":748372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7641140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217070,"mean":12.960631163363,"rank":31191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":185879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217070,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":6.8145590682196,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":6.148,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
