In this study, 37 transformants of A. oligospora were obtained by REMI (restriction enzyme mediated integration) method and phenotypic properties of nine transformants were analyzed. The nine transformants showed differences in growth, conidiation, trap formation, stress tolerance, and\/or pathogenicity among each other and with those of the parental wild-type strain (WT). The insertional sites of the hph cassette were identified in transformants X5 and X13. In X5, the cassette was inserted in the non-coding region between AOL_s00076g273 (76g273) and AOL_s00076g274 (76g274) and the transcription of 76g274, but not 76g273, was enhanced in X5. 76g274p had two conserved domains and was predicted as a nucleoprotein, which we confirmed by its nuclear localization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the green fluorescent protein-fused 76g274p. The transcription of 76g274 was stimulated or inhibited by several environmental factors. The sporulation yields of 76g274-deficient mutants were decreased by 70%, and transcription of several sporulation-related genes was severely diminished compared to the WT during the conidiation. In summary, a method for screening mutants was established in A. oligospora and using the method, we identified a novel C2H2-type transcription factor that positively regulates the conidiation of A. oligospora.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jiang, Dewei","Zhou, Jing","Bai, Guizhen","Xing, Xinjing","Tang, Liyan","Yang, Xuewei","Li, Juan","Zhang, Ke-Qin","Yang, Jinkui","Dewei Jiang","Jing Zhou","Guizhen Bai","Xinjing Xing","Liyan Tang","Xuewei Yang","Juan Li","Ke-Qin Zhang","Jinkui Yang"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-06075-5","first_seen_on":"2017-07-20T00:52:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1500934284,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28717216?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28717216","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28717216?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28717216","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["science"],"title":"Random mutagenesis analysis and identification of a novel C2H2-type transcription factor from the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys oligospora\n        ","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/random-mutagenesis-analysis-identification-novel-c2h2type-transcription-factor-nematodetrapping-fung"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266541,"mean":6.9778542507441,"rank":3790603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4393418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266541,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178132,"mean":11.721835166254,"rank":76389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":98763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178132,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35507,"mean":14.760090519912,"rank":16487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":18361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35507,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3435,"mean":12.076648806057,"rank":1485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3435,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Nematode_papers\/statuses\/887837497920638976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22208303],"posted_on":"2017-07-20T00:52:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Nematode_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"Twitter bot searching the web for new journal articles on #nematodes","id_on_source":"Nematode_papers","tweeter_id":"2882533695","geo":{"lt":54.58333,"ln":-5.93333,"country":"GB"},"followers":116},"tweet_id":"887837497920638976"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nematologists\/statuses\/888404920935870465","license":"gnip","rt":["Nematode_papers"],"citation_ids":[22208303],"posted_on":"2017-07-21T14:26:53+00:00","author":{"name":"IFNS","url":"http:\/\/www.ifns.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/609063261795926017\/hEQ1D_FF_normal.png","description":"The International Federation of Nematology Societies aims to foster communication among nematologists worldwide.","id_on_source":"nematologists","tweeter_id":"3319351007","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":244},"tweet_id":"888404920935870465"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nematodenet\/statuses\/889608983501316097","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22208303],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T22:11:24+00:00","author":{"name":"nematodenet","url":"http:\/\/www.nematode.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1525753331\/twitter_icon_small_normal.png","id_on_source":"nematodenet","tweeter_id":"358257748","geo":{"lt":38.62727,"ln":-90.19789,"country":"US"},"followers":300},"tweet_id":"889608983501316097"}]}}
