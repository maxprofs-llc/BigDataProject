The present study is conducted to classify the association of metformin use with the survival of patients with kidney cancer.\nElectronic databases, namely PubMed and Web of Science, were used to search the eligible studies up to December, 2016. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. It was considered as statistically significant when P value was <0.05.\nEight cohorts were eligible for the present meta-analysis, including 254,329 kidney cancer patients. The combined HR suggested that the use of metformin could improve the overall survival (OS) (HR 0.643, 95% CI 0.520-0.795, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR 0.618, 95% CI 0.446-0.858, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) in kidney cancer patients. In subgroup analysis, positive associations were found between metformin use and OS\/CSS of localized renal cell carcinoma patients (OS: HR 0.634, 95% CI 0.440-0.913, P\u00a0=\u00a00.014; CSS: HR 0.476, 95% CI 0.295-0.768, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Moreover, we also found that the use of metformin could reduce the risk of death in kidney cancer patients (HR 0.711, 95% CI 0.562-0.899, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004).\nOur findings suggest that the use of metformin is in favor of the prognosis of patients with kidney cancers. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of metformin on kidney cancer patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a5e","authors":["Yang Li","Liyi Hu","Qinghong Xia","Yongqiang Yuan","Yonghua Mi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11255-017-1548-4","first_seen_on":"2017-03-14T12:38:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301-1623","1573-2584"],"journal":"International Urology and Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1491842176,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11255-017-1548-4","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11255-017-1548-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11255-017-1548-4.pdf","pmid":"28271326","pubdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Urology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"The impact of metformin use on survival in kidney cancer patients with diabetes: a meta-analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11255-017-1548-4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-metformin-survival-kidney-cancer-patients-diabetes-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":9.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8038089,"mean":6.8236667777181,"rank":855812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7170516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8038089,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232184,"mean":13.57423395339,"rank":40597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":191113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232184,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":1.937065913371,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.809,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/anamarialopezmd\/statuses\/841629419802308609","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17337088],"posted_on":"2017-03-14T12:37:45+00:00","author":{"name":"AnaMaria Lopez","url":"http:\/\/healthsciences.utah.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/583405847037906944\/PRMsayAS_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Vice President for Health Equity and Inclusion @UUtah Health Sciences.
