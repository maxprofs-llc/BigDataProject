This review will focus on one of the most powerful pathways, the canonical Wnt signal transduction cascade, which has been originally described in vertebrate and non-vertebrate embryogenesis and subsequently associated with the development of a multitude of different tumor types, mainly of gastrointestinal origin. In recent years, a variety of novel interacting components and functions have been identified in the Wnt pathway revealing not only the complexity of Wnt signaling but also its potency. Here we will concentrate on the role of the Wnt pathway in cancer development with emphasis placed on the molecular defects known to promote neoplastic transformation in humans and in animal models.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cda","authors":["B Lustig","J Behrens"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00432-003-0431-0","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:34:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0171-5216"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1366723065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12707770"],"pmid":"12707770","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The Wnt signaling pathway and its role in tumor development.","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wnt-signaling-pathway-role-tumor-development-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295164,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94803,"mean":8.1245068880406,"rank":24664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94803,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":2.0395775577558,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.90416666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
