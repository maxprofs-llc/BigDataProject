From the EtOAc fraction, eupatorin was identified for the first time, besides the known casticin, penduletin, vitexin and orientin. The n-hexane, EtOAc and MeOH-H(2)O fractions of the MeOH extract of Agni-casti fructus were subjected to in vitro antioxidant assays. The EtOAc extract displayed a significant concentration-dependent effect when tested by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrasyl (DPPH) free radical assay (IC(50) = 68 microg\/mL) and against the autooxidation of a standard rat brain homogenate (IC(50) = 14 microg\/mL). The MeOH-H(2)O fraction was less active with 3643 microg\/mL (DPPH test) and IC(50) = 125 microg\/mL (rat brain homogenate), while the n-hexane phase proved to be inactive. The main flavonoid constituents of the EtOAc extract, casticin, vitexin and orientin were assayed for antioxidant activity and found that only casticin possesses a marked lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect (IC(50) = 0.049 mm) compared with that of the positive control ascorbic acid (IC(50) = 0.703 mm).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["Hajd\u00fa, Zsuzsanna","Hohmann, Judit","Forgo, Peter","Martinek, Tam\u00e1s","Dervarics, M\u00e1t\u00e9","Zupk\u00f3, Istv\u00e1n","Falkay, Gy\u00f6rgy","Cossuta, Daniel","M\u00e1th\u00e9, Imre"],"doi":"10.1002\/ptr.2021","endpage":"394","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T06:10:03+00:00","issns":["1099-1573","0951-418X","10991573","0951418X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Phytotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1490731468,"links":["http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/cgi-bin\/abstract\/114102753\/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ptr.2021"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ptr.2021\/pdf","pmid":"17262892","pubdate":"2007-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"391","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Diterpenoids and flavonoids from the fruits of Vitex agnus\u2010castus and antioxidant activity of the fruit extracts and their constituents","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ptr.2021","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diterpenoids-flavonoids-fruits-vitex-agnuscastus-antioxidant-activity-fruit-extracts-constituents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":2164557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5111306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242317,"mean":8.3059005595998,"rank":69790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":166642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242317,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1377,"mean":6.0347572674419,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1377,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.8547272727273,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
