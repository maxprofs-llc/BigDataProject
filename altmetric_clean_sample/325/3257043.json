These patients also received concomitant antacid and H2 blocker therapy. In patients receiving itraconazole at 200 and 400 mg\/day, the median concentrations in serum were 0.5 microgram\/ml (range, < 0.05 to 2.7) and 3.5 micrograms\/ml (< 0.5 to 14), respectively. The concentration following administration of 400 mg\/day was > 2.5 micrograms\/ml in 56% of samples, while only 4% of samples from patients who were administered 200 mg\/day had levels over 2.5 micrograms\/ml. This study documents that itraconazole can be absorbed in patients receiving concomitant antacid and H2 blocker therapy. However, the reduced and variable absorption suggests the importance of confirming drug delivery by measurement of concentrations in serum.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a6a","authors":["T F Patterson","J Peters","S M Levine","A Anzueto","C L Bryan","E Y Sako","O L Miller","J H Calhoon","M G Rinaldi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T05:07:05+00:00","issns":["0066-4804"],"issue":"9","journal":"Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1405870886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8878612","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC163504"],"pmcid":"PMC163504","pmid":"8878612","pubdate":"1996-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Systemic availability of itraconazole in lung transplantation.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systemic-availability-itraconazole-lung-transplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4044031,"mean":5.0612478665178,"rank":932742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2553828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4044031,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126466,"mean":9.0068355197091,"rank":38386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126466,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2980,"mean":3.0264719704599,"rank":475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":2031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2980,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":2.8508333333333,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Itraconazole","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=617718768#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3257043],"posted_on":"2014-07-20T15:41:26+00:00","summary":"Itraconazole (R51211), invented in 1984, is a triazole antifungal agent prescribed to patients with fungal infections.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=590072","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
