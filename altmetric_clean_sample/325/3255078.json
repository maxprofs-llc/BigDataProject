It is known as gestational gigantomastia when enlargement in pregnancy becomes excessive, uncomfortable and embarrassing. Gestational gigantomastia may have far reaching effects for the mother and fetus. This rare condition is associated with considerable morbidity but may be associated with good fetal outcome. Our case was very interesting because it was managed conservatively and postpartum there was complete spontaneous resolution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["B U Ezem","C C Osuagwu","K A Opara"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr.01.2010.2632","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T04:07:46+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["1757-790X"],"journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1499963558,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3062818\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bcr.01.2010.2632","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22707463","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3062818","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3062818"],"pmcid":"PMC3062818","pmid":"22707463","pubdate":"2015-02-03T20:11:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Rare disease: Gestational gigantomastia with complete resolution in a Nigerian woman","type":"article","volume":"2011","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gestational-gigantomastia-complete-resolution-nigerian-woman"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":2086099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4996652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240297,"mean":8.263832839498,"rank":68864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":165783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240297,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3226,"mean":5.2309841860465,"rank":641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3226,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":1.9701694915254,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
