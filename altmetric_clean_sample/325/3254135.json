In lower eukaryotes, dsRNA introduced into the cytoplasm is cleaved by the RNaseIII-like enzyme, Dicer, to 21-23 nt RNA (short interfering [si] RNA), which may serve as guide for target mRNA degradation. In mammals, long-dsRNA-dependent PTGS is applicable only to a limited number of cell types, whereas siRNA synthesized in vitro is capable of effectively inducing gene silencing in a wide variety of cells. Although biochemical and genetic analyses in lower eukaryotes showed that Dicer and some PIWI family member proteins are essential for long-dsRNA-dependent PTGS, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying siRNA-based PTGS. Here, we show that Dicer and eIF2C translation initiation factors belonging to the PIWI family (eIF2C1-4) play an essential role in mammalian siRNA-mediated PTGS, most probably through synergistic interactions. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that, in human and mouse cells, complex formation occurs between Dicer and eIF2C1 or 2 and that the PIWI domain of eIF2C is essential for the formation of this complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["Doi, Noboru","Zenno, Shuhei","Ueda, Ryu","Ohki-Hamazaki, Hiroko","Ui-Tei, Kumiko","Saigo, Kaoru"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0960-9822(02)01394-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:46:02+00:00","issns":["0960-9822"],"issue":"1","journal":"Current Biology","last_mentioned_on":1198144633,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0960-9822(02)01394-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12526743"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0960982202013945\/pdf","pmid":"12526743","pubdate":"2015-05-22T22:57:52+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing in mammalian cells requires Dicer and eIF2C translation initiation factors.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shortinterferingrnamediated-gene-silencing-mammalian-cells-requires-dicer-elf2c-translation-initiati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3926119,"mean":5.0184091481892,"rank":898637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2489677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3926119,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121101,"mean":8.9901558420111,"rank":36167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":83357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121101,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090,"mean":17.086363922185,"rank":2062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":2235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":77.153540229885,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
