The aggregation appears to be due to loop-sheet polymerization, although why the mutant protein polymerizes in vivo is unclear. Here we show that, unlike wild type antitrypsin, which folds in minutes, the folding of Z type alpha 1-antitrypsin is extremely slow. Once folded, however, the native Z protein shows substantial stability towards urea and incubation at 37 degrees C. The folding defect in Z antitrypsin leads to accumulation of an intermediate and it is the intermediate rather than the native protein which has a high tendency to aggregate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003170","authors":["M H Yu","K N Lee","J Kim","Yu, M H","Lee, K N","Kim, J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T04:58:21+00:00","issns":["1072-8368"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1224294349,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7664092"],"pmid":"7664092","pubdate":"1995-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The Z type variation of human alpha 1-antitrypsin causes a protein folding defect.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/z-type-variation-human-%CE%B11antitrypsin-causes-protein-folding-defect"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":817008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94163,"mean":8.053007115397,"rank":24385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94163,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":2.7355380116959,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
