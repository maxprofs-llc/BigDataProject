Studies on steroid enantiomer pairs can yield powerful new information on the pharmacology of steroid interactions with the GABA(A) receptor. Both steroids enhance currents elicited by GABA, but ent-etiocholanolone is much more powerful than etiocholanolone at producing potentiation. At a low GABA concentration (0.5 microM, <EC(5)), the presence of 10 microM ent-etiocholanolone potentiates whole-cell currents by almost 30-fold, whereas 10 microM etiocholanolone merely doubles the peak response. At higher GABA concentration (5 microM, approximately EC(25)), the potentiation curve for ent-etiocholanolone is positioned at lower concentrations than that for etiocholanolone. Single-channel kinetic analysis shows that exposure to etiocholanolone has a single effect on currents: the relative frequency of long openings is increased in the presence of steroid. But exposure to ent-etiocholanolone produces two kinetic effects: an increase in the relative frequency of long openings and a decrease in the frequency of long closed times. The presence of etiocholanolone does not inhibit potentiation by ent-etiocholanolone, suggesting that etiocholanolone is unable to interact with the sites through which ent-etiocholanolone modifies receptor function. The double mutation alpha1(N407A\/Y410F) prevents potentiation by etiocholanolone but not by ent-etiocholanolone, and the alpha1(Q241A) and alpha1(I238N) point mutations fully abolish potentiation by etiocholanolone but not by ent-etiocholanolone. We conclude that etiocholanolone and its enantiomer interact with distinct sites on the alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["Ping Li","John Bracamontes","Bryson W.
