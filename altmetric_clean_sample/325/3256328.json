Its pharmacologic activity, specifically its effects in acute and subchronic inflammation, and its analgesic activity have been assessed in animal models. The tolerability of the compound as judged by several parameters (i.e., ratio between the acute lethal dose or the dose inducing gastrointestinal blood loss and the desired pharmacologic activity) is favorable in comparison with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Diclofenac sodium acts by potent cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, reduction of arachidonic acid release, and enhancement of arachidonic acid uptake. It thereby results in a dual inhibitory effect on both the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["D W Scholer","E C Ku","I Boettcher","A Schweizer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T04:42:54+00:00","issns":["0002-9343"],"issue":"4B","journal":"American Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1295589300,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3085490"],"pmid":"3085490","pubdate":"1986-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pharmacology of diclofenac sodium.","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacology-diclofenac-sodium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94187,"mean":8.0585730363325,"rank":24396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94187,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2054,"mean":6.3189624939113,"rank":564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2054,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":5.64765,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
