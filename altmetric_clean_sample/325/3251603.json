We found that congenitally blind (CB) subjects have increased sensitivity for orthonasal odorants and recruit their visually deprived occipital cortex to process orthonasal olfactory stimuli. In sharp contrast, CB perform less well than sighted controls in taste and retronasal olfaction, i.e. when processing chemicals inside the mouth. Interestingly, CB do not recruit their occipital cortex to process taste stimuli. In contrast to these findings in blindness, congenital anosmia is associated with lower taste and trigeminal sensitivity, accompanied by weaker activations within the 'flavour network' upon exposure to such stimuli. We conclude that functional adaptations to congenital anosmia or blindness are quite distinct, such that CB can train their exteroceptive chemical senses and recruit normally visual cortical areas to process chemical information from the surrounding environment.","altmetric_jid":"54904dcf2a83ee743b8b4567","authors":["Maurice Ptito","L\u00e9a Gagnon","Ron Kupers"],"doi":"10.1163\/22134808-00002461","endpage":"419","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:02:44+00:00","issns":["2213-4808","2213-4794"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Multisensory Research","last_mentioned_on":1443288939,"links":["http:\/\/booksandjournals.brillonline.com\/content\/journals\/10.1163\/22134808-00002461","http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/268520486_Making_Sense_of_the_Chemical_Senses","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25693303"],"pmid":"25693303","pubdate":"2014-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Brill","startpage":"399","title":"Making sense of the chemical senses.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/making-sense-chemical-senses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8384362,"mean":7.0636082026922,"rank":1920659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6448422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8384362,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242095,"mean":8.2972077292292,"rank":60916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":180471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242095,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":3.1254198473282,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
