A hypercoagulable state occurs when a deficiency of antithrombin exists in plasma; the deficiency may be either inherited or acquired. This failure to regulate adequately the activity of coagulation proteinases can, with additional provocation, result in clot formation and in the clinical presentation of thromboembolic disease. The structure and function of antithrombin, nature and heterogeneity of the molecular defects in the antithrombin gene associated with inherited antithrombin deficiency, prevalence and the natural history of inherited antithrombin deficiency are all reviewed here.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f6","authors":["H H van Boven","D A Lane"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T02:50:12+00:00","issns":["0037-1963"],"issue":"3","journal":"Seminars in Hematology (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1209815872,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9241705"],"pmid":"9241705","pubdate":"1997-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Antithrombin and its inherited deficiency states.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antithrombin-inherited-deficiency-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":816503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94280,"mean":8.0702319922784,"rank":24429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94280,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.0983870967742,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Antithrombin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=209888252#altmetric_citation_36","license":"public","citation_ids":[3250873],"posted_on":"2008-05-03T11:57:52+00:00","summary":"Antithrombin (AT) is a small protein molecule that inactivates several enzymes of the coagulation system.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=511049","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"DOI bot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:DOI bot"}}]}}
