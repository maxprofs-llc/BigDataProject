The use of the selective cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide provided a test of these hypotheses in rats that were either inexperienced with or tolerant to opiates. Proglumide potentiated analgesia produced by morphine and endogenous opiates and seemed to reverse tolerance. These results suggest that endogenous cholecystokinin systems oppose the action of opiates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1984Sci...224..395W","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["LR Watkins","IB Kinscheck","DJ Mayer","Watkins, L R","Kinscheck, I B","Mayer, D J","L.
