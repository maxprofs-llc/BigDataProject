A total of 30 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were used for this study: 24 aged rats, and 6 young rats. The older animals were randomly divided into four groups designated as follows: aged-control, aged-exercise, aged-LLLT, aged-LLLT\/exercise group, and young-control animals. Aerobic capacity (VO2max) was analyzed before and after training period. The aged-exercise and aged-LLLT\/exercise groups were trained for 6\u00a0weeks. LLLT laser was applied before each training session with 808 nm and 4\u00a0J of energy to the indicated groups throughout training. The rats were euthanized, and muscle tissue and serum were collected for muscle cross-sectional area and IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 protein analysis. In VO2 showed statistical difference between young- and aged-control groups (used as baseline) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The same difference can be observed in the young control group compared with all intervention groups (exercise, LLLT and LLLT\u2009+\u2009exercise). In comparison with the aged-control group, a difference was observed only for comparison with the exercise group (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and exercise associated with LLLT group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 for the aged-exercise and the aged-LLLT\/exercise groups were significantly decreased compared to the aged-control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Analysis of the transverse section of the gastrocnemius muscle showed a significant difference between the aged-exercise and aged-LLLT\/exercise groups (p\u2009<\u20090.001). These results suggest that laser therapy in conjunction with aerobic training may provide a therapeutic approach for reducing the inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1), however, LLLT without exercise was not able to improve physical performance of aged rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fe2","authors":["Eliane Martins Amadio","Andrey Jorge Serra","Simone A.
