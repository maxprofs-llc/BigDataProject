We show further that promoter melting does not change protein-DNA interactions upstream of the region that undergoes melting but does change interactions within and downstream of this region. Our results rule out the proposal that IIH functions in promoter melting through a conventional DNA-helicase mechanism. We propose that IIH functions as a molecular wrench: rotating downstream DNA relative to fixed upstream protein-DNA interactions, thereby generating torque on, and melting, the intervening DNA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2000Sci...288.1418K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Tae-Kyung Kim","Richard H.
