Each underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy. In 9 patients, the biopsy specimen showed immunoglobulin A nephritis, an established cause of LPHS. We suggest these cases be designated secondary LPHS. They are not included in this analysis. The remaining patients (N = 34) are designated idiopathic (primary) LPHS. They are the basis of this report.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570b","doi":"10.1053\/j.ajkd.2005.11.029","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:41:53+00:00","issns":["0272-6386"],"journal":"American Journal of Kidney Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1254871082,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1053\/j.ajkd.2005.11.029","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16490620"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajkd.org\/article\/S0272638605019487\/pdf","pmid":"16490620","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Proposed pathogenesis of idiopathic loin pain-hematuria syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proposed-pathogenesis-idiopathic-loin-painhematuria-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94247,"mean":8.0571929206546,"rank":24413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94247,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":996,"mean":3.2097608040201,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":996,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.9877272727273,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Hematuria","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=318345210#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3253913],"posted_on":"2009-10-06T23:18:02+00:00","summary":"In medicine, hematuria, or haematuria, is the presence of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in the urine.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=582968","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Ratel","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Ratel"}}]}}
