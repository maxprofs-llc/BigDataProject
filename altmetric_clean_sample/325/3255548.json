Therapy for chronic viral hepatitis C may improve PCT. However, there are only a few reports of the de novo development of PCT during therapy for chronic viral hepatitis C. We describe the development of PCT in a 56-year-old patient with chronic viral hepatitis C after 12 wk of peginterferon\/ribavirin therapy. In addition, the patient was homozygous for the H63D hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The association of PCT with chronic viral hepatitis C and the possible role of hepatic iron overload and ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in the development of PCT during therapy for chronic viral hepatitis C are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d0f","authors":["James Azim","Heather McCurdy","Richard-H Moseley"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T04:19:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1007-9327"],"issue":"38","journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1228426351,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18855993"],"pmcid":"PMC2751904","pmid":"18855993","pubdate":"2008-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Porphyria cutanea tarda as a complication of therapy for chronic hepatitis C.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/porphyria-cutanea-tarda-complication-therapy-chronic-hepatitis-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":817226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94087,"mean":8.0517676806328,"rank":24359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94087,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1816,"mean":2.416267768595,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1816,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.2211551724138,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
