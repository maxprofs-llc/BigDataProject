Vitronectin binding extends the lifetime of active PAI-1, which controls hemostasis by inhibiting fibrinolysis and has also been implicated in angiogenesis. The PAI-1-vitronectin binding interaction also affects cell adhesion and motility. For these reasons, elevated PAI-1 activities are associated both with coronary thrombosis and with a poor prognosis in many cancers. Here we show the crystal structure at a resolution of 2.3 A of the complex of the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin with PAI-1. The structure of the complex explains how vitronectin binds to and stabilizes the active conformation of PAI-1. It also explains the tissue effects of PAI-1, as PAI-1 competes for and sterically blocks the interaction of vitronectin with cell surface receptors and integrins. Structural understanding of the essential biological roles of the interaction between PAI-1 and vitronectin opens the prospect of specifically designed blocking agents for the prevention of thrombosis and treatment of cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Aiwu Zhou","James A Huntington","Navraj S Pannu","Robin W Carrell","Randy J Read","Zhou, Aiwu","Huntington, James A","Pannu, Navraj S","Carrell, Robin W","Read, Randy J"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsb943","endpage":"544","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T04:36:43+00:00","issns":["1072-8368","10728368"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1300410400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nsb943","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12808446"],"pmid":"12808446","pubdate":"2003-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"541","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"How vitronectin binds PAI-1 to modulate fibrinolysis and cell migration.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nsb943","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitronectin-binds-pai1-modulate-fibrinolysis-cell-migration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":1130569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2962271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161957,"mean":8.8741730346515,"rank":47804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":111993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161957,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1639,"mean":6.6740146520147,"rank":560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1639,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":18.7076,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
