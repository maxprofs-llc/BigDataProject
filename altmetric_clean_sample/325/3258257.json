The plants were exposed to concentrations of 0 mg\/L, 0.5 mg\/L or 2 mg\/L of mercury for 30 days. Assays were conducted using both Microtox (water) and cold vapor Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) (roots and water). The Microtox results indicated that the mercury induced acute toxicity had been removed from the water. AAS confirmed an increase of mercury within the plant root tissue and a corresponding decrease of mercury in the water. All species of plants appeared to reduce mercury concentrations in the water via root uptake and accumulation. Water lettuce and water hyacinth appeared to be the most effective, followed by taro and zebra rush, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Skinner K","Wright N","Porter-Goff E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2006.03.017","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T05:51:08+00:00","issns":["0269-7491"],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1194779917,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.envpol.2006.03.017","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16781033"],"pmid":"16781033","pubdate":"2006-06-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Mercury uptake and accumulation by four species of aquatic plants.","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mercury-uptake-accumulation-four-species-aquatic-plants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":816291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94331,"mean":8.0755693416731,"rank":24453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94331,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":569,"mean":6.0134577464789,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":569,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.1821428571429,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
