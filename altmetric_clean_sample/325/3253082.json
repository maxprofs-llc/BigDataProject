Fluconazole was the only systemic antifungal therapy available in our centre. From 1999-2001 we used low-dose fluconazole (200 mg daily initially), and did not offer therapy to patients perceived to have poor prognoses. In 2001 donated fluconazole became available, allowing us to use standard doses (400 mg daily initially). Antiretroviral therapy was not available during the study period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["CF Schaars","GA Meintjes","C Morroni","FA Post","G Maartens"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2334-6-118","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:28:14+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1157986458,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2334-6-118","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16846523","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1540428"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2334-6-118.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1540428","pmid":"16846523","pubdate":"2006-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"118","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Outcome of AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis initially treated with 200 mg\/day or 400 mg\/day of fluconazole","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcome-aidsassociated-cryptococcal-meningitis-initially-treated-200-mgday-400-mgday-fluconazole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94150,"mean":8.0517063378264,"rank":24378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94150,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2164,"mean":2.6368599167822,"rank":490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2164,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":1.8767755102041,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
