All methods of treatment aim to reduce the anal sphincter spasm associated with chronic anal fissures. Surgical techniques have been used for over 100 years with success. Lateral internal sphincterotomy remains the surgical treatment of choice for many practitioners. Postoperative impairment of continence remains controversial. Recently, less invasive methods of treatment have been explored. Topical nitrates, calcium channel blockers and botulinum toxin are established treatments. These and other non-surgical treatments are described in this review. Various guidelines and treatment algorithms for anal fissure are also discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000361c","authors":["E. E. Collins","J. N.
