The peptide appears to be encoded by a single-copy gene that gives rise to multiple mRNAs that are heterogeneous at both their 5' and their 3' ends. Alternative RNA splicing is responsible for the 3' heterogeneity and results in mRNAs encoding three different peptides, each with a unique C terminus. We have isolated and characterized the human PTHLP gene. The gene is a complex transcriptional unit spanning more than 12 kilobases of DNA and containing six exons. Two 5' exons encode distinct 5' untranslated regions and are separated by a putative promoter element, indicating that the gene either has two promoter or is alternatively spliced from a single promoter upstream of the first exon. The middle portion of the PTHLP gene, comprising exons 2-4, has an organizational pattern of introns and exons identical to that of the parathyroid hormone gene, consistent with a common ancestral origin of these two genes. Exon 4 of the PTHLP gene encodes the region common to all three peptides and the C terminus of the shortest peptide, and exons 5 and 6 encode the unique C termini of the other two peptides. Northern analysis of mRNAs from four human tumors of different histological types reveals the preferential use of 3' splicing patterns by individual tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1989PNAS...86.2408M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["M Mangin","K Ikeda","B E Dreyer","A E Broadus"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.86.7.2408","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:28:44+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1196094221,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.86.7.2408","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2928340","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC286922"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/86\/7\/2408.full.pdf","pmid":"2928340","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Isolation and characterization of the human parathyroid hormone-like peptide gene.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-characterization-human-parathyroid-hormonelike-peptide-gene-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94127,"mean":8.0513098187537,"rank":24373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94127,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33578,"mean":13.652389790631,"rank":13012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33578,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":910,"mean":38.468642464246,"rank":552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":910,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Parathyroid hormone-related protein","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=173910767#altmetric_citation_14","license":"public","citation_ids":[3253117],"posted_on":"2007-11-26T16:23:41+00:00","summary":"Parathyroid hormone-related protein (or PTHrP) is a protein member of the parathyroid hormone family.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=562890","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Banus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Banus"}}]}}
