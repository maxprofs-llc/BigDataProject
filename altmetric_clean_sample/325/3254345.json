A surprising and still-cryptic requirement of this process is the energy dependent retrotranslocation of both lumenal and membrane-embedded ER proteins into the cytosol for ongoing ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. The current understanding, results, and open questions are discussed below for this intriguing and critical process of ERAD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a0","authors":["Hampton RY","Sommer T"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceb.2012.05.010","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T03:49:41+00:00","issns":["0955-0674"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1362649158,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ceb.2012.05.010"],"pmid":"22854296","pubdate":"2012-08-03T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Finding the will and the way of ERAD substrate retrotranslocation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/finding-way-erad-substrate-retrotranslocation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627218,"mean":4.9497513377373,"rank":817722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627218,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93850,"mean":8.00875491481,"rank":24270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93850,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":487,"mean":2.2692098765432,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":487,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.0583333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
