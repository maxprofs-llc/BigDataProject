Participants also reported their overall perception of rapport with each client and their comfort with technology.\nThere was a strong correlation between TASC-r total scores and overall ratings of rapport, providing preliminary evidence of TASC-r face validity. There was no significant difference between TASC-r scores for telepractice and face-to-face therapy (p\u2009=\u20090.961), nor face-to-face and telepractice SLPs' confidence with familiar (p\u2009=\u20090.414) or unfamiliar technology (p\u2009=\u20090.780).\nThe TASC-r may be a promising tool for measuring therapeutic alliance in speech-language pathology. Telepractice does not appear to have a negative effect on rapport between SLPs and paediatric clients. Future research is required to identify how SLPs develop rapport in telepractice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b6","authors":["Anneka Freckmann","Monique Hines","Michelle Lincoln"],"doi":"10.1080\/17549507.2017.1292547","first_seen_on":"2017-03-07T21:41:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1754-9507","1754-9515"],"journal":"International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1503397858,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/3e5MuGE8tUXhuHPDZr5v\/full","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17549507.2017.1292547","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/eprint\/dHiH9nxF5HND5eUptYA6\/full","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17549507.2017.1292547#.WR7cCxps6U0.twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17549507.2017.1292547?journalCode=iasl20&utm_campaign=crowdfire&utm_content=crowdfire&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter#3329521331-tw#1499508119378"],"pmid":"28264584","pubdate":"2017-03-08T22:09:58+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Clinicians\u2019 perspectives of therapeutic alliance in face-to-face and telepractice speech\u2013language pathology sessions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinicians-perspectives-therapeutic-alliance-facetoface-telepractice-speechlanguage-pathology-sessio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.2,"score_history":{"1y":15.2,"6m":6.65,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":576022,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7837361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243631,"mean":13.719190559454,"rank":29766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243631,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":5.4411019283747,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":8.0235294117647,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":8,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":11,"IE":1,"NZ":1,"GB":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/coconutgoose\/statuses\/839229413719887873","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17090226],"posted_on":"2017-03-07T21:40:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Anneka Freckmann","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/411658649241542657\/M-Rzanbq_normal.jpeg","description":"New grad speechie, keen on research and rural health","id_on_source":"coconutgoose","tweeter_id":"218791876","geo":{"lt":-33.86785,"ln":151.20732,"country":"AU"},"followers":94},"tweet_id":"839229413719887873"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSLP\/statuses\/839308973094264832","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17090226],"posted_on":"2017-03-08T02:57:07+00:00","author":{"name":"IJSLP","url":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/toc\/iasl20\/current","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/774049159548506112\/JXpcnhet_normal.jpg","description":"The International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology: @SpeechPathAus's principle academic publication, produced in Feb Apr Jun Aug Oct.
