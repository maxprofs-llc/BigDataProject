His electrocardiogram revealed 1-1.5mm ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3 with reciprocal depressions in II, III, and aVF. Mid-anterior wall akinesis was observed on echocardiography associated with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. A left main coronary artery dissection was diagnosed and treated surgically with a bypass graft. Although rare, coronary dissections can be a catastrophic complication of chest trauma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005704","authors":["Maheshwari, Ankit","Thenappan, Thenappan","Das, Gladwin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajem.2017.03.007","first_seen_on":"2017-03-08T00:50:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0735-6757","07356757","1532-8171"],"journal":"American Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1488934229,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajemjournal.com\/article\/S0735-6757(17)30173-0\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28292545","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Adding fuel to the fire: Coronary artery dissection complicating blunt chest trauma","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7197946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242236,"mean":13.673552484158,"rank":201384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242236,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2903,"mean":5.0841867677464,"rank":2203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2903,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":4.79295,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QuickMedClaims1\/statuses\/839277103715659781","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17093899],"posted_on":"2017-03-08T00:50:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Quick Med Claims","url":"http:\/\/www.quickmedclaims.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812313237412806656\/2R1aUXNV_normal.jpg","description":"A National Leader in Emergency Medical Transportation Billing\/Reimbursement for EMS and the Air Medical Industry.
