More than seven decades later we know that these mechanisms include histone tail post-translational modifications, DNA methylation, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA pathways. Epigenetic modifications are powerful drugs targets, and combined targeting of multiple pathways is expected to significantly advance cancer therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","aggregated_in":[18008018],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90b3cf058f61000caa9","authors":["Alison Urvalek","Kristian Bruun Laursen","Lorraine J Gudas","Urvalek A","Laursen KB","Gudas LJ","Lorraine J.
