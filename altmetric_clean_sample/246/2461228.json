A complement receptor of the Ig superfamily (CRIg) is expressed on synovial macrophages of RA patients, making it an interesting target for molecular imaging of RA. We aim to develop a radiotracer for the visualization of CRIg in a mouse model for RA using radiolabeled single-domain variable antibody VHH fragments (Nanobodies).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Zheng F","Put S","Bouwens L","Lahoutte T","Matthys P","Muyldermans S","De Baetselier P","Devoogdt N","Raes G","Schoonooghe S"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.113.130617","first_seen_on":"2014-06-24T19:51:50+00:00","issns":["0161-5505"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1418706000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24686780?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24686780"],"pmid":"24686780","pubdate":"2014-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Molecular Imaging with Macrophage CRIg-Targeting Nanobodies for Early and Preclinical Diagnosis in a Mouse Model of Rheumatoid Arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-imaging-macrophage-crigtargeting-nanobodies-early-preclinical-diagnosis-mouse-model-rheuma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4742065,"mean":5.6918457903606,"rank":353175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4386498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4742065,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113715,"mean":8.1061122816893,"rank":11901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":101753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113715,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1629,"mean":2.4890761670762,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1629,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":2.3419705882353,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
