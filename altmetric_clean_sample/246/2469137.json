Diseases such as diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis are prevalent in our society and pose major challenges with respect to the overall health and economy. Therefore, better understanding of regulatory axes between bone and fat may provide the basis for development of strategies which will treat these diseases simultaneously and improve health and life quality of elderly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","doi":"10.1016\/j.abb.2014.06.010","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T05:00:42+00:00","issns":["00039861"],"journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1403845192,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003986114002124"],"pmid":"24956594","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Bone and fat: A relationship of different shades ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-fat-relationship-different-shades"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":3583891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107315,"mean":7.8677440035785,"rank":83070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107315,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1675,"mean":2.5139940262843,"rank":1398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1675,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.1899,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
