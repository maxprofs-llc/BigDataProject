In this study, a series of carbamate derivative was synthesized, and their inhibition effects on hCA I, hCA II and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes were investigated. They were determined to be very good inhibitor against for both isoenzymes (hCA I and hCA II) and AChE. The hCA I and hCA II were effectively inhibited by the carbamate derivatives, with inhibition constants (Ki) in the range of 194.4-893.5\u2009nM (for hCA I) and 103.9-835.7\u2009nM (for hCA II). On the other hand, Ki parameters of these compounds for AChE enzyme inhibition were determined in the range of 12.0-61.3\u2009nM. The results clearly showed that both CA isoenzymes and AChE were inhibited by carbamate derivatives at the nM levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["H\u00fclya G\u00f6\u00e7er"],"doi":"10.3109\/14756366.2014.928704","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T01:00:04+00:00","issns":["1475-6366","1475-6374"],"journal":"Journal of Enzyme Inhibition & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1403772112,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14756366.2014.928704"],"pmid":"24964347","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effects of carbamates and sulfamoylcarbamates.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbonic-anhydrase-acetylcholinesterase-inhibitory-effects-carbamates-sulfamoylcarbamates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2875585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1469124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107309,"mean":7.8105103626946,"rank":66444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":36970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107309,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":446,"mean":0.57067415730337,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":446,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.32352941176471,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
