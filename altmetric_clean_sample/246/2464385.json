As health professionals, we are well aware of the epidemic growth of injuries and deaths related to texting and driving. It should not surprise us that this distracted behavior has affected all levels of health-care providers and has impacted patient care. This advent of \"distracted doctoring\" was first coined by the Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent Matt Richtel in a landmark article in the New York Times, \"As doctors use more devices, potential for distraction grows.\" This article was a flashpoint for professional organizations to reflect on this change in behavior and how it will impact patient safety and how we relate to patients. The explosion in technology (both personnel and hospital-based), coupled with a rapid social shift, creates an environment that constantly tempts health-care workers to surf the internet, check social media outlets, or respond to e-mails. Studies and commentaries in the medical literature only support how this is a growing problem in patient safety and may both increase medical errors and affects costs and the way we relate to patients and fellow staff. The Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) released its annual list of technology hazards for 2013, and three ring true for United States caregivers: distractions from smartphones and mobile devices, alarm hazards, and patient\/data mismatches in electronic medical records and other health IT systems, all being in the top 10. How do we begin to address these new technological threats to our patients? First and foremost, we accept that this problem exists. We begin by educating our students and staff that this electronic explosion affects our behavior through addiction and the environment within our hospital through the use of electronic medical records, alarms, and alerts that may impact vigilance and affect our focus. These educational and policy changes should, at their core, address human-to-technology interfacing and teach electronic etiquette. How we approach patients should always have at its core the ancient adage \"know thyself\"; in other words, always practice self-examination in our daily interactions with technology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005ca2","authors":["Peter J Papadakos"],"doi":"10.4187\/respcare.03483","first_seen_on":"2014-06-26T17:56:11+00:00","issns":["1943-3654"],"journal":"Respiratory Care","last_mentioned_on":1439410568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24962225?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24962225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24962225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24962225","pubdate":"2014-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Electronic Distractions of the Respiratory Therapist and Their Impact on Patient Safety.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electronic-distractions-respiratory-therapist-impact-patient-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5477001,"mean":6.3622219996345,"rank":2019514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3430838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5477001,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131302,"mean":8.1534109412725,"rank":39852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":90606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131302,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":2.6025007320644,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.5086206896552,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
