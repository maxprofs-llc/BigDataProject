However, generation of new transgenic mice for lineage-tracing purposes is often time consuming. Here, we report a lineage-tracing tool for MECs based on intraductal injection of lineage-specific Cre-expressing adenovirus (Ad-Cre). Using well-characterized promoters for Keratin 8 and Keratin 14, we generated lineage-specific Ad-Cre lines for luminal and basal MECs, respectively. By pulse-chase lineage tracing using these Ad-Cre lines, we showed that luminal and basal lineages are largely self-sustained and that IRS1 and IRS2 are essential for maintaining the basal lineage; we also showed that heterogeneous mammary tumors can be induced from luminal MECs in mice carrying the Etv6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Overall, we validated the Ad-Cre system as a promising and efficient tool for fate mapping of normal and malignant cells in adult tissues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Luwei Tao","Maaike\u00a0P.A. van\u00a0Bragt","Elizabeth Laudadio","Zhe Li"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.stemcr.2014.04.004","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T01:50:27+00:00","funders":["nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["2213-6711",""],"issue":"6","journal":"Stem Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1403748000,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/stem-cell-reports\/abstract\/S2213-6711%2814%2900111-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2213671114001118\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4050356","pmid":"24936465","pubdate":"2014-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"770","title":"Lineage Tracing of Mammary Epithelial Cells Using Cell-Type-Specific Cre-Expressing Adenoviruses","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lineage-tracing-mammary-epithelial-cells-using-celltypespecific-creexpressing-adenoviruses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.88,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.88},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4018593,"mean":5.0292510539975,"rank":572255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3446306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4018593,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98965,"mean":7.6094864799321,"rank":17186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":81766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98965,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":18.424374100719,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":28.663882352941,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
