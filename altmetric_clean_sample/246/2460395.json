We analysed whether the prognoses by Haux et al. - first presented in 2000 and published in 2002 [1] - have been fulfilled in 2013 and which might be the reasons for match or mismatch. Twenty international experts in biomedical and health informatics met in May 2013 in a workshop to discuss match or mismatch of each of the 71 prognoses. After this meeting a web-based survey among workshop participants took place. Thirty-three prognoses were assessed matching; they reflect e.g. that there is good progress in storing patient data electronically in health care institutions. Twenty-three prognoses were assessed mismatching; they reflect e.g. that telemedicine and home monitoring as well as electronic exchange of patient data between institutions is not established as widespread as expected. Fifteen prognoses were assessed neither matching nor mismatching. ICT tools have considerably influenced health care in the last decade, but in many cases not as far as it was expected by Haux et al. in 2002. In most cases this is not a matter of the availability of technical solutions but of organizational and ethical issues. We need innovative and modern information system architectures which support multiple use of data for patient care as well as for research and reporting and which are able to integrate data from home monitoring into a patient centered health record. Since innovative technology is available the efficient and wide-spread use in health care has to be enabled by systematic information management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e46","authors":["Petra Knaup","Elske Ammenwerth","Carl Dujat","Andrew Grant","Arie Hasman","Andreas Hein","Achim Hochlehnert","Casimir Kulikowski","John Mantas","Victor Maojo","Michael Marschollek","Lincoln Moura","Maik Plischke","Rainer R\u00f6hrig","J\u00fcrgen Stausberg","Katsuhiko Takabayashi","Frank Uckert","Alfred Winter","Klaus-Hendrik Wolf","Reinhold Haux","Frank \u00dcckert","Knaup P","Ammenwerth E","Dujat C","Grant A","Hasman A","Hein A","Hochlehnert A","Kulikowski C","Mantas J","Maojo V","Marschollek M","Moura L","Plischke M","R\u00f6hrig R","Stausberg J","Takabayashi K","Uckert F","Winter A","Wolf KH","Haux R"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10916-014-0073-6","first_seen_on":"2014-06-24T10:55:00+00:00","issns":["0148-5598","1573-689X"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Medical Systems","last_mentioned_on":1407959855,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24952606?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10916-014-0073-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24952606"],"pmid":"24952606","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer New York LLC","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Assessing the prognoses on health care in the information society 2013 - thirteen years after.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-prognoses-health-care-information-society-2013-thirteen-years-after"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":620171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3884752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107607,"mean":7.802520974667,"rank":18132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":89384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107607,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":1.6176206896552,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.3785714285714,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
