A detailed bio-reduction analysis of redox-sensitive albumin conjugates in two FcRn-expressing cell lines has been performed. The obtained results indicate that the FcRn-mediated recycling pathway is not (or is only poorly) bio-reducing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Br\u00fclisauer L","Valentino G","Morinaga S","Cam K","Thostrup Bukrinski J","Gauthier MA","Leroux JC","Br\u00fclisauer, Lorine","Valentino, Gina","Morinaga, Sakura","Cam, K\u00fcbra","Thostrup\u2005Bukrinski, Jens","Gauthier, Marc A.","Leroux, Jean\u2010Christophe","Lorine Br\u00fclisauer","Gina Valentino","Sakura Morinaga","K\u00fcbra Cam","Jens Thostrup Bukrinski","Marc A.
