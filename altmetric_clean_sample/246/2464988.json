Praziquantel based chemotherapy and morbidity control for this disease adopted currently necessitate viable and efficient diagnostic technologies. Fortunately, those \"-omics\" researches, which rely on high-throughput experimental technologies to produce massive amounts of informative data, have substantially contributed to the exploitation and innovation of diagnostic tools of schistosomiasis. In its first section, this review provides a concise conclusion on the progresses pertaining to schistosomal \"-omics\" researches to date, followed by a comprehensive section on the diagnostic methods of schistosomiasis, especially those innovative ones based on the detection of antibodies, antigens, nucleic acids, and metabolites with a focus on those achievements inspired by \"-omics\" researches. Finally, suggestions about the design of future diagnostic tools of schistosomiasis are proposed, in order to better harness those data produced by \"-omics\" studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Hu, Wei","Wang, Shuqi"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00313","first_seen_on":"2014-06-26T21:11:42+00:00","issns":["","1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1403805441,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00313\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fmicb.2014.00313\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4072072","pmid":"25018752","pubdate":"2014-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Development of \u201c-omics\u201d research in Schistosoma spp. and -omics-based new diagnostic tools for schistosomiasis","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-omics-research-schistosoma-spp-omicsbased-new-diagnostic-tools-schistosomiasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107362,"mean":7.8427269306362,"rank":83113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107362,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2654,"mean":2.726342254052,"rank":2012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2654,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":4.1088148148148,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
