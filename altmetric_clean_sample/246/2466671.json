The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown but store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) components participate in calcium homeostasis, potentially playing a significant role in chronic pain pathologies. Most G protein-coupled receptors activated by inflammatory mediators trigger calcium-dependent signaling pathways and stimulate SOCE in primary afferents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TRPC3, a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel coupled to phospholipase C and highly expressed in DRG, as a link between activation of pro-inflammatory metabotropic receptors and SOCE in nociceptive pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000875","doi":"10.1186\/1744-8069-10-43","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T00:34:58+00:00","issns":["1744-8069"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Pain","last_mentioned_on":1426295406,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularpain.com\/content\/10\/1\/43\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24965271?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularpain.com\/content\/pdf\/1744-8069-10-43.pdf","pmid":"24965271","pubdate":"2014-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["molecularbiology","psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Contribution of TRPC3 to store-operated calcium entry and inflammatory transductions in primary nociceptors.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-trpc3-storeoperated-calcium-entry-inflammatory-transductions-primary-nociceptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4868490,"mean":5.7954838530026,"rank":2414101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2307425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4868490,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120418,"mean":7.9660149314467,"rank":54439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":61465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120418,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":2.6474413793103,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.279,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
