One member of this protein family, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9, is increasingly being investigated as therapeutic target for infectious diseases and cancer. Double-Stem Loop ImmunoModulator (dSLIM) is a new TLR-9 agonist in clinical development for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Compared with other TLR-9 ligands developed as immunomodulators, dSLIM comprises single- and double-stranded DNA, is covalently closed, and consists of natural nucleotide components only. All investigated biologic effects of dSLIM are strongly dependent on CG motifs, and the relevant cellular activation profile of dSLIM is distinct to that of other TLR-9 agonists. Here we describe the structure and biologic profile of dSLIM: in isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), dSLIM induced a unique pattern of cytokine secretion, activated within the PBMC pool particular cell subpopulations, and exhibited specific cytotoxicity on target cells. Using cellular isolation and depletion setups, the mechanism of immunoactivation by dSLIM was deduced to be dependent on, but not restricted to, TLR-9-bearing plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The dSLIM-promoted cellular stimulation directs systemic activation of the immune response as revealed in cancer patients. The observed cellular activation cascades are discussed in the context of cancer therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"5524eb302a83eef6558b4567","authors":["Kerstin Kapp","Christiane Kleuss","Matthias Schroff","Burghardt Wittig"],"doi":"10.1038\/mtna.2014.28","first_seen_on":"2014-06-25T12:35:52+00:00","issns":["2162-2531"],"journal":"Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids","last_mentioned_on":1403699627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24959843?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24959843","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Genuine Immunomodulation With dSLIM.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genuine-immunomodulation-dslim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3943238,"mean":5.0286812580263,"rank":2197907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1019662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3943238,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97624,"mean":7.620054517517,"rank":51600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97624,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.1517857142857,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
