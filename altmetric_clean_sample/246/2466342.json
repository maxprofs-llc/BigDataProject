Pharmacoepidemiologic studies that rely on administrative claims data in older adults are limited by confounding due to unmeasured frailty. A claims-based frailty score may be useful to minimize confounding by frailty in such databases. We provide an overview of definitions and measurement of frailty, evaluated the claims-based models of frailty in literature, and recommend ways to improve frailty adjustment in claims analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100066ef","authors":["Dae Hyun Kim","Sebastian Schneeweiss"],"doi":"10.1002\/pds.3674","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T00:07:15+00:00","issns":["1099-1557"],"journal":"Pharmacoepidemiology & Drug Safety","last_mentioned_on":1411046554,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24962929?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24962929"],"pmid":"24962929","pubdate":"2014-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Measuring frailty using claims data for pharmacoepidemiologic studies of mortality in older adults: evidence and recommendations.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-frailty-using-claims-data-pharmacoepidemiologic-studies-mortality-older-adults-evidence-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2234889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107301,"mean":7.7666461323394,"rank":46630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":55875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107301,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":700,"mean":3.1695135908441,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":700,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8951428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
