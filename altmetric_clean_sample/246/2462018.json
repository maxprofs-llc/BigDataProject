These new phases contain sheets or chains of apex-linked V(3+)O4 squares stacked with SrH layers\/chains, such that the n=\u221e member, SrVO2H, can be considered to be analogous to \"infinite-layer\" phases, such as Sr(1-x)Ca(x)CuO2 (the parent phase of the high-T(c) cuprate superconductors), but with a d(2) electron count. All three oxide-hydride phases exhibit strong antiferromagnetic coupling, with SrVO2H exhibiting an antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, T(N)>300\u2005K. The strong antiferromagnetic couplings are surprising given they appear to arise from \u03c0-type magnetic exchange.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Denis\u2005Romero, Fabio","Leach, Alice","M\u00f6ller, Johannes S.","Foronda, Francesca","Blundell, Stephen J.","Hayward, Michael A."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201403536","endpage":"7559","first_seen_on":"2014-06-24T23:03:54+00:00","issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"29","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
