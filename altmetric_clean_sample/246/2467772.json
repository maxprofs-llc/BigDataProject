A lengthy pretreatment period with NAC may not be feasible in urgent situations. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an abbreviated, higher dose regimen of NAC for the prevention of CIN after elective and urgent coronary angiography (cath) and\/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0b","authors":["Ochoa A","Pellizzon G","Addala S","Grines C","Isayenko Y","Boura J","Rempinski D","O'Neill W","Kahn J"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1540-8183.2004.09880.x","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T02:08:56+00:00","issns":["0896-4327"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Interventional Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1403746978,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15209578"],"pmid":"15209578","pubdate":"2004-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Abbreviated dosing of N-acetylcysteine prevents contrast-induced nephropathy after elective and urgent coronary angiography and intervention.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abbreviated-dosing-nacetylcysteine-prevents-contrastinduced-nephropathy-after-elective-urgent-corona"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3057635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107302,"mean":7.7665742164567,"rank":71634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107302,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.4189090909091,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":4,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"SA":1,"CA":1,"IR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rx_Ed\/status\/481975878251855872","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2467772],"posted_on":"2014-06-26T01:42:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Ed","url":"https:\/\/medquestreviews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/876661938226315264\/o3XVOtB6_normal.jpg","description":"Board certified infectious diseases specialist & HIV researcher.
