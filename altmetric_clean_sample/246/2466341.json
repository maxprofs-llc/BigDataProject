The clinical translation is that this can improve the care of children with ASD. Chromosome microarray is now the first-tiered genetic investigation for ASD, with a detection rate exceeding conventional cytogenetics and any single gene testing. However, interpretation of the results is challenging and there is no consensus on \"what\" and \"how much\" to disclose. In this article, we will review how CNV studies have improved our understanding of ASD, the clinical applications, and related counseling issues. Future direction of autism genetic research is also discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c90","authors":["Brian Hon-Yin Chung","Victoria Qinchen Tao","Winnie Wan-Yee Tso"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jfma.2013.01.005","first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T00:07:11+00:00","issns":["0929-6646","09296646"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1493516811,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24961180?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24961180","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24961180?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0929664613000570"],"pmid":"24961180","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Taiwan LLC","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Copy number variation and autism: New insights and clinical implications.","type":"article","volume":"113","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/copy-number-variation-autism-new-insights-clinical-implications-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":1857652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6282194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177783,"mean":7.4172224297176,"rank":41514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":135829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177783,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":2.4808604651163,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1730769230769,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
