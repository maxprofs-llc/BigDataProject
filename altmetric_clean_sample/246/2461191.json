In this study, clastogenotoxicity of vinblastine (1.5\u2009mg\/kg b w) and its prevention by caffeine at different doses (25, 50 and 100\u2009mg\/kg b w) administered intraperitoneally was assessed in in vivo mice. It was found that micronucleus level had decreased significantly (up to 28.8%) in 100\u2009mg caffeine treated group at 30\u2009h post treatment. However, it did not exhibit protective effect against chromosomal aberration in spaermatogonial cells at 24\u2009h post treatment. The frequencies of aberrant primary spermatocytes had decreased significantly in 25 and 100\u2009mg caffeine at 4th week of post treatment. Similarly, in 100\u2009mg of caffeine administered, abnormal sperm level had reduced (4.01%) significantly at 8th week post treatment. Thus, caffeine decreased the vinblastine induced chromosomal aberrations and mitotic index in bone marrow cells. In conclusion, this study shows that caffeine exerts protective effect against vinblastin induced cytogenotoxicity. Further studies on molecular mechanism are interesting in order to develop it as an effective drug in cancer chemotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003ba8","authors":["Prakash Geriyol"],"doi":"10.3109\/01480545.2014.928720","first_seen_on":"2014-06-24T19:42:48+00:00","issns":["0148-0545"],"journal":"Drug & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1403626741,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/01480545.2014.928720","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/01480545.2014.928720"],"pmid":"24956935","pubdate":"2014-06-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Protecting effect of caffeine against vinblastine (an anticancer drug) induced genotoxicity in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protecting-effect-caffeine-against-vinblastine-anticancer-drug-induced-genotoxicity-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3041379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":929079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107614,"mean":7.8395916664346,"rank":70920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107614,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":1.7771518324607,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.2833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_Toxicology\/status\/481471565071020032","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2461191],"posted_on":"2014-06-24T16:19:01+00:00","author":{"name":"T&F Toxicology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/668779195099709440\/n6CZC9_R_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with all the latest news and content from Taylor & Francis Toxicology journals.","id_on_source":"IHC_Toxicology","tweeter_id":"26992934","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":2528},"tweet_id":"481471565071020032"}]}}
