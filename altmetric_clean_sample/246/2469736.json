Although irinotecan showed significant survival advantage for patients, a relatively low response rate and severe adverse effects demonstrated the urgent need for biomarkers searching to select the suitable patients who can benefit from irinotecan-based therapy and avoid the adverse effects. In present work, the irinotecan response (IC50 doses) of 20 CRC cell lines were correlated with the basal expression profiles investigated by RNA-seq to figure out genes responsible for irinotecan sensitivity\/resistance. Genes negatively or positively correlated to irinotecan sensitivity were given after biocomputation, and 7 (CDC20, CTNNAL1, FZD7, CITED2, ABR, ARHGEF7, and RNMT) of them were validated in two CRC cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR, several of these 7 genes has been proposed to promote cancer cells proliferation and hence may confer CRC cells resistance to irinotecan. Our work might provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for irinotecan sensitivity in CRC cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2b","authors":["Xin-Xiang Li","Hong-Tu Zheng","Jun-Jie Peng","Li-Yong Huang","De-Bing Shi","Lei Liang","San-Jun Cai"],"first_seen_on":"2014-06-27T10:09:08+00:00","issns":["1936-2625"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1403863649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24966994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24966994","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"RNA-seq reveals determinants for irinotecan sensitivity\/resistance in colorectal cancer cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rnaseq-reveals-determinants-irinotecan-sensitivityresistance-colorectal-cancer-cell-lines"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3569002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107302,"mean":7.7664125217847,"rank":82239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107302,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":836,"mean":0.9551497005988,"rank":450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.72727272727273,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
