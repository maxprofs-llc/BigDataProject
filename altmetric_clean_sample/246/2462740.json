Fifty-three pooled samples were created and subjected to EvaGreen(\u00ae) RealTime PCR assay and HRM analysis for protozoans detection and oocyst quantification. Seven out of 8 sites were contaminated with at least one protozoan species. Twenty-one out of 53 (39.6%) samples tested positive for T.\u00a0gondii, C.\u00a0cayetanensis or both pathogens: 26.4% samples positive for C.\u00a0cayetanensis; 9.4% for T.\u00a0gondii, and 3.8% for both protozoans. The number of oocysts in positive samples ranged from 6 to 30 for T.\u00a0gondii and from 3 to 48 for C.\u00a0cayetanensis. This is the first report of T.\u00a0gondii Type 1, and C.\u00a0cayetanensis in M.\u00a0galloprovincialis, the most consumed shellfish species in Turkey.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f8","doi":"10.1016\/j.fm.2014.05.012","first_seen_on":"2014-06-25T03:30:47+00:00","issns":["07400020"],"journal":"Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1403667008,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S074000201400118X"],"pmid":"25084654","publisher":"Academic Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Detection of Toxoplasma gondii and Cyclospora cayetanensis in Mytilus galloprovincialis from Izmir Province coast (Turkey) by Real Time PCR\/High-Resolution Melting analysis (HRM) ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-toxoplasma-gondii-cyclospora-cayetanensis-mytilus-galloprovincialis-izmir-province-coast-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107275,"mean":7.859716613532,"rank":70547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107275,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":2.6214910714286,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1318181818182,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
