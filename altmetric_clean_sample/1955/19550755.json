Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive disease with dismal prognosis. Currently, surgical resection offers the best chance for extended survival, yet recurrence remains high and is associated with poor outcome. Systemic treatment has evolved from non-specific, cytotoxic chemotherapy to the use of cancer-targeting agents, profoundly changing treatment approaches in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. One promising approach, highlighted in this review, uses the inherent capacity of Salmonella to colonize and eliminate solid tumors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e75","authors":["Ebelt, Nancy D.","Manuel, Edwin R.","Nancy D.
