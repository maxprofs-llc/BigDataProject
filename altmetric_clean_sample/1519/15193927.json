It could have serious consequences for the victim's health if not recognised early, denounced and stopped. Abuse is often undetected by service providers because there is a lack of awareness surrounding the magnitude of the problem. Education and formal training in the signs of abuse are also generally poorly developed, as are reporting procedures which would lead to further investigation.\nThe aim of this study is to review the efficacy and accuracy of tools administered to older people, intended to detect and measure elder abuse.\nSystematic review.\nComprehensive database searches of MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS were undertaken. Screening of 695 articles resulted in 11 included. Appraisal and analysis using PRISMA Statement and STROBE checklist were undertaken.\n11 screening tools have been presented: H-S\/EAST, VASS, EASI, CASE, BASE, E-IOA, EAI, EPAS, CPEABS, OAPAM, OAFEM, all aimed at health care professional or, in some cases, expected to be specifically used by nurses.\nThe fundamental function of any assessment instrument is to guide through a standardised screening process and to ensure that signs of abuse are not missed. Several tools have been tested; some have demonstrated a moderate to good internal consistency and some have been validated to allow an early identification. None have been evaluated against measurable violence or health outcomes.\nNurses and all health care providers should screen patients routinely. However, we are not able to recommend a single tool since the selection and implementation has to be appropriate to the setting. Furthermore, the study population and the possibility of using multiple tools in combination should be taken in consideration, to assess all the aspects of violence.
