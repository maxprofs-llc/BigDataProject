Utilizing genotype data in the absence of a reference genome, however, presents a number of challenges. One major challenge is the tradeoff between splitting alleles at a single locus into separate clusters (loci), creating inflated homozygosity, and lumping multiple loci into a single contig (locus), creating artifacts and inflated heterozygosity. This issue has been addressed primarily through the use of similarity cutoffs in sequence clustering. Here, two commonly employed, post -clustering, filtering methods (read depth and excess heterozygosity) used to identify incorrectly assembled loci are compared with haplotyping, another post-filtering clustering approach. Simulated and empirical data sets were used to demonstrate that each of the three methods separately identified incorrectly assembled loci; more optimal results were achieved when the three methods were applied in combination. The results confirmed that including incorrectly assembled loci in population-genetic datasets inflates estimates of heterozygosity and deflates estimates of population divergence. Additionally, at low levels of population divergence, physical linkage between SNPs within a locus created artificial clustering in analyses that assume markers are independent. Haplotyping SNPs within a locus effectively neutralized the physical linkage issue without having to thin data to a single SNP per locus. We introduce a Perl script that haplotypes polymorphisms, using data from single or paired-end reads, and identifies potentially problematic loci. This article is protected by copyright.
