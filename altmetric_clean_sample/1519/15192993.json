However, only a small number of studies have been conducted in Taiwan to determine the efficacy of acupressure in treating these side effects in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In this quasi-experimental study, we aimed to explore the effects of acupressure on meridian energy as well as nausea and vomiting in 70 lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients were assigned to the experimental or control group based on order of hospital admission. The experimental group received acupressure on \"Neiguan (PC6)\" and \"Gongsun (SP4)\" points, and the control group received sham acupoint patches on \"Houxi (SI3)\" point. The results showed that the mean meridian energy in the experimental group after acupressure was significantly higher than in the control group ( F = 28.71, p < .001). The experimental group had significantly less nausea ( p < .001) and vomiting ( p = .006) during the delayed phase than the control group. In conclusion, acupressure significantly increased the mean meridian energy and effectively decreased the severity of nausea and vomiting in lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We recommend that clinical nurses provide acupressure as an intervention to relieve nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023db","authors":["Shen, Chi-Hsiang","Yang, Li-Yu"],"doi":"10.1177\/1099800416683801","first_seen_on":"2017-01-02T11:53:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1552-4175","1099-8004"],"journal":"Biological Research for Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1487226300,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28024410","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/1099800416683801"],"pmid":"28024410","pubdate":"2017-01-06T23:24:05+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","medicine"],"title":"The Effects of Acupressure on Meridian Energy as well as Nausea and Vomiting in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-acupressure-meridian-energy-nausea-vomiting-lung-cancer-patients-receiving-chemotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4370105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2282101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265585,"mean":12.501520641303,"rank":149302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":89747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265585,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":3.334406779661,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.1383333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":5,"Linguistics":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drouinjulien\/statuses\/815888731840413697","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15192993],"posted_on":"2017-01-02T11:53:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Julien Drouin MD","url":"http:\/\/www.ascensionsante.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/604352666832125952\/gaQndfiy_normal.jpg","description":"Psychotherapist.
