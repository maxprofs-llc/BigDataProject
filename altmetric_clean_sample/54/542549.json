A total of 2319 children enrolled before birth in the KOALA Birth Cohort Study were followed during their first 2 yr of life using repeated questionnaires. Information was obtained on common colds, fever, and diarrhea with fever as well as on wheeze and eczema at ages 3 and 7 months and 1 and 2 yr, respectively. Blood samples were collected from 786 children at age 2 yr for specific immunoglobulin E analyses. Children with a common cold [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.03 95% CI 1.21-3.41] or fever episode (aOR 1.81 95% CI 1.10-2.96) in the first 3 months of life had a higher risk of new onset wheeze in the second year of life compared to children who had not. For children with diarrhea with fever in the first 3 months of life, the aOR for new onset wheeze in the second year of life was 3.94 (95% CI 1.36-11.40) compared to children without diarrhea. Infections becoming clinically manifest during the first 3 months of life may be a general marker for a wheezy phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a8","authors":["Mommers M","Thijs C","Stelma F","Penders J","Reimerink J","van Ree R","Koopmans M"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1399-3038.2010.01042.x","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T14:18:40+00:00","issns":["0905-6157","1399-3038"],"issue":"6","journal":"Pediatric Allergy & Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1292457600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20718929","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1399-3038.2010.01042.x"],"pmid":"20718929","pubdate":"2010-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["pediatrics","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Timing of infection and development of wheeze, eczema, and atopic sensitization during the first 2\u2003yr of life: The KOALA Birth Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/timing-infection-development-wheeze-eczema-atopic-sensitization-during-first-2-yr-life-koala-birth-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289679233405,"rank":2015397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231493,"mean":3.9550408999016,"rank":100635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231493,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":574,"mean":4.2263769633508,"rank":448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":574,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.8248985507246,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
