Transport of \"hot\" particles of different composition resulted in the high activity concentrations of (137)Cs, (238)Pu, (239,240)Pu and (241)Am in the atmosphere in Vilnius at the end of April 1986. The (240)Pu\/(239)Pu atom ratio showed clear evidence of non-global plutonium originating from the Chernobyl accident in the atmosphere over Lithuania. The (240)Pu\/(239)Pu atom ratio ranged from 0.14 to 0.40 in monthly samples in Vilnius in 1995-2003. An increase in activity concentration of (137)Cs by a factor of 100 (up to 300 microBq\/m(3)) was found following forest fires in the Ukraine and Belarus. However, no transport of the Chernobyl plutonium was observed and the (240)Pu\/(239)Pu atom ratio in samples collected during the forest fires was found to be 0.229 and 0.185, respectively. The exponential decrease in the (240)Pu\/(239)Pu atom ratio from 0.30 to 0.19 (mean values) was observed in 1995-2003.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f13cf058f610002d89","authors":["Lujaniene, G","Aninkevicius, V","Lujanas, V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jenvrad.2007.07.015","first_seen_on":"2012-01-02T11:38:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0265-931X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Environmental Radioactivity","last_mentioned_on":1325504165,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17884261\/"],"pmid":"17884261","pubdate":"2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Artificial radionuclides in the atmosphere over Lithuania.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artificial-radionuclides-atmosphere-lithuania"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231697,"mean":3.9301524583941,"rank":100150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231697,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":6.3323705882353,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":16.145714285714,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
