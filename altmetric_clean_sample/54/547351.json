Cytogenetic studies show an abnormal karyotype in 50-60% of the T-cell ALL patients; ABL1 fusions are present in approximately 8% of the cases. Dasatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, directly targets the BCR-ABL gene. We describe a pediatric case of T-cell ALL with amplification of the ABL1 gene in which remission was achieved only after the addition of dasatinib to conventional chemotherapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Crombet, Ofelia","Lastrapes, Kelly","Zieske, Arthur","Morales\u2010Arias, Jaime","Ofelia Crombet","Kelly Lastrapes","Arthur Zieske","Jaime Morales-Arias"],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.23327","first_seen_on":"2012-01-04T18:34:48+00:00","issns":["1545-5009","1545-5017","15455009"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1325701926,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002%2Fpbc.23327"],"pmid":"22689211","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Complete morphologic and molecular remission after introduction of dasatinib in the treatment of a pediatric patient with t\u2010cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and ABL1 amplification","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/pbc.23327","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-morphologic-molecular-remission-after-introduction-dasatinib-treatment-pediatric-patient-tc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4702119,"mean":5.7121287683577,"rank":3335094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":763451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4702119,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235707,"mean":4.4408087447925,"rank":146511,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235707,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1412,"mean":1.8628462083629,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1412,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":0.986,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
