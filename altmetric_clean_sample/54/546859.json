The most stable squaraine rotaxanes have four large stopper groups attached to the ends of the encapsulated squaraine, and two members of this structural class have promise as highly fluorescent tracers with rapid renal clearance and very low tissue uptake in living mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Erin L.
