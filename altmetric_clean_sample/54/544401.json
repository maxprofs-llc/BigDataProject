The interaction mechanisms between three phthalate plasticizers with human serum albumin (HSA) were studied by fluorescence (quenching, synchronous, and three-dimensional), UV-vis absorption, circular dichroism (CD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, in combination with molecular modeling under simulative physiological conditions, respectively. The results obtained from fluorescence quenching data revealed that the plasticizers-HSA interaction altered the conformational strcture of HSA. Meanwhile, the alterations of HSA secondary structure in the presence of phthalate plasticizers were investigated. The binding distances for the plasticizers-HSA system were provided by the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, the thermodynamic analysis implied that hydrophobic forces were the main interaction for the plasticizers-HSA system, which agreed well with the results from the molecular modeling study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Zhou X","L\u00fc W","Su L","Shan Z","Chen X"],"doi":"10.1021\/jf204380r","first_seen_on":"2012-01-02T07:07:59+00:00","issns":["0021-8561"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1325487388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22206277"],"pmid":"22206277","pubdate":"2011-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Binding of phthalate plasticizers to human serum albumin in vitro: A multi-spectroscopic approach and molecular modeling.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binding-phthalate-plasticizers-human-serum-albumin-vitro-multispectroscopic-approach-molecular-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":2325736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1540804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235113,"mean":4.2029035778695,"rank":101483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":97408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235113,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4013,"mean":4.31327666999,"rank":2062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4013,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":3.3534025974026,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
