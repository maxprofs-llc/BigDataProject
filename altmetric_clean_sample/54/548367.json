New Study Shows Typical Peers Benefit Too","Typical peers helping out with #autism interventions can benefit too!"],"citation":{"abstract":"This study examined the social impact of being a typical peer model as part of a social skills intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants were drawn from a randomized-controlled-treatment trial that examined the effects of targeted interventions on the social networks of 60 elementary-aged children with ASD. Results demonstrated that typical peer models had higher social network centrality, received friendships, friendship quality, and less loneliness than non-peer models. Peer models were also more likely to be connected with children with ASD than non-peer models at baseline and exit. These results suggest that typical peers can be socially connected to children with ASD, as well as other classmates, and maintain a strong and positive role within the classroom.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cb4","authors":["Jill Locke","Erin Rotheram Fuller","Connie Kasari"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10803-011-1437-0","endpage":"1905","first_seen_on":"2012-01-05T12:52:10+00:00","funders":["phs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1573-3432","0162-3257"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1439805634,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22215436","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/m8370v1t128247r4\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4188858\/"],"pmid":"22215436","pubdate":"2012-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1895","subjects":["psychiatry","pediatrics"],"title":"Exploring the Social Impact of Being a Typical Peer Model for Included Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-social-impact-typical-peer-model-included-children-autism-spectrum-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5492745,"mean":6.376680732254,"rank":258239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":5232649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5492745,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240337,"mean":4.6158795269957,"rank":8897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":231400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240337,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1895,"mean":8.5715131995776,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1895,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":5.1409433962264,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
