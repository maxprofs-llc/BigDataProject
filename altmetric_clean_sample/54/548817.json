We investigated the roles of Th subsets in cGVHD with the use of a well-defined mouse model of cGVHD. In this model, development of cGVHD was associated with up-regulated Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses. Th1 and Th2 responses were up-regulated early after BM transplantation, followed by a subsequent up-regulation of Th17 cells. Significantly greater numbers of Th17 cells were infiltrated in the lung and liver from allogeneic recipients than those from syngeneic recipients. We then evaluated the roles of Th1 and Th17 in cGVHD with the use of IFN-\u03b3-deficient and IL-17-deficient mice as donors. Infusion of IFN-\u03b3(-\/-) or IL-17(-\/-) T cells attenuated cGVHD in the skin and salivary glands. Am80, a potent synthetic retinoid, regulated both Th1 and Th17 responses as well as TGF-\u03b2 expression in the skin, resulting in an attenuation of cutaneous cGVHD. These results suggest that Th1 and Th17 contribute to the development of cGVHD and that targeting Th1 and Th17 may therefore represent a promising therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating cGVHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","doi":"10.1182\/blood-2011-01-332478","first_seen_on":"2012-01-05T18:41:10+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1325788511,"links":["http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/119\/1\/285.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/119\/1\/285.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org\/content\/119\/1\/285.full.pdf","pmid":"22077062","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Synthetic retinoid Am80 ameliorates chronic graft-versus-host disease by down-regulating Th1 and Th17","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-retinoid-am80-ameliorates-chronic-graftversushost-disease-downregulating-th1-th17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6057655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1078107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249790,"mean":4.9803138649022,"rank":161523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249790,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9718,"mean":5.3613296284862,"rank":7840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9718,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":754,"mean":2.1483612217795,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":754,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
