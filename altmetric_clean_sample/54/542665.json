The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) initiated a prospective phase II trial to investigate the outcome of patients treated with imatinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with AF, or 1 of 10 sarcoma subtypes. Here, we report specifically on the outcome of patients with AF as well as evaluations undertaken to examine the mechanism of imatinib.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Chugh R","Wathen JK","Patel SR","Maki RG","Meyers PA","Schuetze SM","Priebat DA","Thomas DG","Jacobson JA","Samuels BL","Benjamin RS","Baker LH","R.
