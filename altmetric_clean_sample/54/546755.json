Preparation of such engagements sets the stage for engagement activities and thus contributes to their outcomes. Preparation is a demanding task, particularly if the facilitating agent aims for timely engagement related to emerging technologies. Requirements for such preparation include understanding of the emerging science & technology and its dynamics. Multi-level analysis and socio-technical scenarios are two complementary tools for constructing productive engagement. Examination of the emergence of nanotechnologies in the food packaging sector demonstrates how these tools work. In light of recent policy demands for responsible innovation, but also more generally, the role of organizers of engagement activities is one that deserves reflection insofar as it can extend beyond that of preparation and facilitation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034de","authors":["Haico te Kulve","Arie Rip"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11948-011-9304-0","first_seen_on":"2012-01-04T10:14:29+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"Science & Engineering Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1325686805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3242942\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmid":"21898147","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Business, Management and Accounting","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"699","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Constructing Productive Engagement: Pre-engagement Tools for Emerging Technologies","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/constructing-productive-engagement-preengagement-tools-emerging-technologies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3557749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":831122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238224,"mean":4.4790764871572,"rank":148163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43935,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238224,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":6.0443302180685,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":5.475,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
