Metabolites of these compounds in zebrafish after exposure for 24 h were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS, whereby the separation was performed with a Zorbax C-18 column using a gradient elution of 0.05% formic acid acetonitrile-0.05% formic acid water. The quasi-molecular ions of compounds were detected in simultaneous negative and positive ionization modes. Metabolic products of icariin and epimedin C via cleavage of glucose residue instead of rhamnose residues were found, which coincided with the results using regular metabolic analysis methods. In addition, the zebrafish model was used to predict the metabolism of the trace component epimedin A, whose metabolic mechanisms haven't been clearly elucidated with the current metabolism model. The metabolic pathway of epimedin A in zebrafish was similar to those of its homologue icariin and epimedin C. Our study demonstrated that the zebrafish model can successfully imitate the current models in elucidating metabolic pathways of model flavonoids, which has advantages of lower cost, far less amount of compound needed, easy set up and high performance. This novel model can also be applied in quickly predicting the metabolism of Chinese herb components, especially trace compounds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Yingjie Wei"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules17010420","first_seen_on":"2012-01-04T08:13:33+00:00","issns":["1420-3049",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1325663630,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/17\/1\/420\/?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/17\/1\/420\/pdf","pmid":"22217555","pubdate":"2012-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Metabolite Profiling of Four Major Flavonoids of Herba Epimdii in Zebrafish","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolite-profiling-four-major-flavonoids-herba-epimdii-zebrafish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282925,"mean":5.0205658482736,"rank":3398054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282925,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234013,"mean":4.0233818949458,"rank":168401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234013,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1428,"mean":1.7168114926419,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1428,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":0.59412297734628,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
