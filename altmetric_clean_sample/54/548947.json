Here, we uncover a hitherto unrecognized DP transmitter, TGF-\u03b22, which activates Smad2\/3 transiently in HFSCs concomitant with entry into tissue regeneration. This signaling is critical: HFSCs that cannot sense TGF-\u03b2 exhibit significant delays in HF regeneration, whereas exogenous TGF-\u03b22 stimulates HFSCs in vivo and in vitro. By engineering TGF-\u03b2- and BMP-reporter mice, we show that TGF-\u03b22 signaling antagonizes BMP signaling in HFSCs but not through competition for limiting Smad4-coactivator. Rather, our microarray, molecular, and genetic studies unveil Tmeff1 as a direct TGF-\u03b22\/Smad2\/3 target gene, expressed by activated HFSCs and physiologically relevant in restricting and lowering BMP thresholds in the niche. Connecting BMP activity to an SC's response to TGF-\u03b2s may explain why these signaling factors wield such diverse cellular effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1f","authors":["Elaine Fuchs"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.stem.2011.11.005","first_seen_on":"2012-01-05T20:12:19+00:00","funders":["niams"],"issns":["1934-5909"],"journal":"Cell Stem Cell","last_mentioned_on":1445568872,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-stem-cell\/abstract\/S1934-5909(11)00533-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22226356"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/cell-stem-cell\/pdf\/PIIS1934590911005339.pdf","pmid":"22226356","pubdate":"2012-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Paracrine TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Counterbalances BMP-Mediated Repression in Hair Follicle Stem Cell Activation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paracrine-tgf%CE%B2-signaling-counterbalances-bmpmediated-repression-hair-follicle-stem-cell-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6503394,"mean":6.0248163400238,"rank":1180001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5316742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6503394,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243807,"mean":4.685839372288,"rank":42325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":201187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243807,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1264,"mean":26.082913697546,"rank":748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1264,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":7.5913421052632,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Ph.
