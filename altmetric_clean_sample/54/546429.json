The aim of this study was to determine whether statin intake is associated with improved long-term outcomes in these patients. A total of 649 patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms were studied, of whom 147 were taking statins at their first presentation and 502 were not. After a median follow-up period of 3.6 years, 30 patients (20%) taking statins had died, compared with 167 patients (33%) not taking statins (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1, p = 0.049); 87 patients (59%) taking statins reached the composite end point of death, rupture, dissection, or repair compared with 378 patients (75%) not taking statins (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.91, p = 0.006). After adjustments for co-morbidities, the association between statin therapy and the composite end point was driven mainly by a reduction in aneurysm repairs (hazard ratio 0.57 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.83, p = 0.003). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival rate of patients taking statins was significantly better (p = 0.047). In conclusion, the intake of stains was associated with an improvement in long-term outcomes in this cohort of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms. This was driven mainly by a reduction in aneurysm repairs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Jovin IS","Duggal M","Ebisu K","Paek H","Oprea AD","Tranquilli M","Rizzo J","Memet R","Feldman M","Dziura J","Brandt CA","Elefteriades JA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2011.11.038","first_seen_on":"2012-01-04T08:17:43+00:00","issns":["00029149","0002-9149"],"issue":"7","journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1332500321,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSCONTENT&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0002914911034540&_version=1&md5=37effa59390a3ae8a9007033dafdd91d&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(11)03454-0\/abstract"],"pmid":"22221941","pubdate":"2012-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Comparison of the Effect on Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms of Taking Versus Not Taking a Statin Drug.","type":"article","volume":"109","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-effect-longterm-outcomes-patients-thoracic-aortic-aneurysms-taking-versus-not-taking-stat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":1806659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1649398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231534,"mean":3.9110905054574,"rank":83666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":134023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231534,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2363,"mean":3.1003844199831,"rank":1013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2363,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208,"mean":1.9201062801932,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/DavidMayMD\/status\/183145737041883136","citation_ids":[546429],"posted_on":"2012-03-23T10:58:41+00:00","author":{"name":"David May","url":"http:\/\/www.cvscardio.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/697742575290060800\/TbjMDBi7_normal.jpg","description":"Cardiologist\/ PhD Pharmacology: Healthcare delivery Healthcare policy, AUC, EHR, Tweets are my own.","id_on_source":"DavidMayMD","tweeter_id":"487645475","geo":{"lt":32.78306,"ln":-96.80667,"country":"US"},"followers":3990},"tweet_id":"183145737041883136"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CardiologiaF\/status\/154455563550457856","citation_ids":[546429],"posted_on":"2012-01-04T06:54:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
