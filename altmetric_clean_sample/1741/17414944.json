Porous graphitic carbon chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) detection has emerged as a method with a particularly high potential of resolving isomeric oligosaccharides, but little attention has so far been paid to quantitation of the results obtained. In this work, we isolated a range of structures from Man5 to complex type N-glycans with zero to four sialic acids and blended them into an equimolar \"glyco tune mix\". When subjected to liquid chromatography-ESI-MS in positive and negative modes, the glyco tune mix clearly demonstrated the futility of quantitation of N-glycans of different overall composition, different number of sialic acids, and strongly differing size without compensation for their very different molar responses. Relative quantitation of human plasma N-glycans was performed with correction factors deduced from this external glyco tune mix. Addition of just one isotope-coded internal standard with enzymatically added (13)C-galactose led to absolute quantification in the same experiment.
