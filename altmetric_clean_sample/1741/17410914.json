Here, we further examined the anti-HIV effect of IFN-\u03bbs in macrophages. We found that IFN-\u03bbs synergistically enhanced anti-HIV activity of antiretrovirals [azidothymidine (AZT), efavirenz, indinavir, and enfuvirtide] in infected macrophages. Importantly, IFN-\u03bbs could suppress HIV infection of macrophages with the drug-resistant strains, including AZT-resistant virus (A012) and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant virus (TC49). Mechanistically, IFN-\u03bbs were able to induce the expression of several important anti-HIV cellular factors, including myxovirus resistance 2 (Mx2), a newly identified HIV post-entry inhibitor and tetherin, a restriction factor that blocks HIV release from infected cells. These observations provide additional evidence to support the potential use of IFN-\u03bbs as therapeutics agents for the treatment of HIV infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cb02","authors":["Wang, Xu","Wang, He","Liu, Man-Qing","Li, Jie-Liang","Zhou, Run-Hong","Zhou, Yu","Wang, Yi-Zhong","Zhou, Wang","Ho, Wen-Zhe"],"doi":"10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00210","first_seen_on":"2017-03-16T15:49:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-3224"],"journal":"Frontiers in immunology","last_mentioned_on":1489677736,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00210\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FIMMU_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00210\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5337814","pmid":"28321215","pubdate":"2017-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"IFN-\u03bb Inhibits Drug-Resistant HIV Infection of Macrophages","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fimmu.2017.00210\/full","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ifn-inhibits-drugresistant-hiv-infection-macrophages"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":7232069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243629,"mean":13.608623434088,"rank":202672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243629,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3674,"mean":3.0738442689899,"rank":2966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3674,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":4.2409855072464,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Student  > Ph.
