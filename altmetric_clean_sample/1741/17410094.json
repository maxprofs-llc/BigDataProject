We illustrate its performance by recording time-resolved difference spectra of bacteriorhodopsin in the carboxylic range (1800-1700cm(-1)) and on the CO rebinding reaction of myoglobin (1960-1840cm(-1)), at a spectral resolution of 1cm(-1). The spectrometric setup covers the time range from 4ns to nearly a second with a response time of 10-15ns. Absorption changes as low as 1\u00d710(-4) are detected in single-shot experiments at t>1\u03bcs, and of 5\u00d710(-6) in kinetics obtained after averaging 100 shots. While previous time-resolved IR experiments have mostly been conducted on hydrated films of proteins, we demonstrate here that the brilliance of tunable quantum cascade lasers is superior to perform ns time-resolved experiments even in aqueous solution (H2O).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000359f","authors":["Bernd-Joachim Schultz","Hendrik Mohrmann","Victor A.
