Insect GABA-gated cation channels have also been described. The sequencing of insect genomes has enhanced our understanding of the subunits that make up GABA receptor gene families of many species, including a genetic model organism (Drosophila melanogaster) as well as pest, vector and beneficial (pollinator) species. Individual GABA-gated chloride channel subunits can be subject to alternative splicing and RNA editing. These post-transcriptional modifications can add to the diversity of GABA-gated chloride channel subtypes. Insecticides acting on GABA-gated chloride channels include polychlorocycloalkanes, cyclodienes, macrocyclic lactones, phenylpyrazoles, isoxazolines and metadiamides. Structural studies are not yet available for invertebrate GABA receptors but are available for an invertebrate L-glutamate-gated chloride channel and a vertebrate (human) ionotropic GABA-gated chloride channel \u03b23 subunit, thereby facilitating the modelling of insect GABA-gated chloride channels. Repeated applications of cyclodienes in the post-war years resulted in high levels of resistance, the molecular investigation of which led to the identification of the Rdl (resistance-to-dieldrin) locus, encoding a GABA-gated chloride channel subunit. A single channel-lining mutation was associated with dieldrin resistance. Understanding the molecular basis of resistance has accelerated the development of field diagnostic tests. Toxicity issues relating to insecticides targeting GABA-gated chloride channels are addressed, including the impact on beneficial insect species (pollinators), mammals and wildlife.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002693","authors":["Buckingham, Steven","Ihara, Makoto","Sattelle, David B","Matsuda, Kazuhiko"],"doi":"10.2174\/0929867324666170613075736","first_seen_on":"2017-06-14T10:12:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1875-533X"],"journal":"Current Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1497532385,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28606041?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28606041","pubdate":"2017-06-14T22:10:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Mechanisms of action, resistance and toxicity of insecticides targeting GABA receptors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-action-resistance-toxicity-insecticides-targeting-gaba-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":3972891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4214073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242257,"mean":12.646140454725,"rank":112971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":122030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242257,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1056,"mean":3.1203526066351,"rank":506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1056,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.7794827586207,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ir_papers\/statuses\/874932446676094977","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21053823],"posted_on":"2017-06-14T10:12:05+00:00","author":{"name":"IRpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"ir_papers","tweeter_id":"4730901436","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4},"tweet_id":"874932446676094977"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/poll_papers\/statuses\/874936986921861120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21053823],"posted_on":"2017-06-14T10:30:07+00:00","author":{"name":"PollinationPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/546839695229870080\/PwDhY8nS_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous updates from PubMed for pollination and plant mating.
