In this sense it has been shown that highly galactosylated but not agalactosylated IgG1 immune complexes (ICs) inhibit C5aR-mediated pro-inflammatory immune responses via the assembly of Fc\u03b3RIIB-Dectin-1 receptor complexes. In this study we demonstrated that Galectin-3, a galactose-binding lectin that is known to cross-link proteins on cell-surfaces via binding their N-glycans, bound to highly-galactosylated, but not agalactosylated IgG1. Further, Galectin-3 was essential for the IC-mediated inhibition of C5a-induced neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro. Taken together our results indicate that Galectin-3 mediates the interaction of ICs with the Fc\u03b3RIIB-Dectin-1 receptor complex for delivering immunoregulatory signals to inhibit C5aR-mediated immune responses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Kerstin A.
