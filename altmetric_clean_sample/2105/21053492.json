Pilot test were conducted in flasks to demonstrate that a mixture of three mononitrophenols at 0.5 mM each could be mineralized by this microbial consortium within 84 hours. Interestingly, neither ONP nor MNP was degraded until PNP was almost consumed by strain WBC-3. By immobilizing this consortium into polyurethane cubes, all three mononitrophenols were continuously degraded in lab-scale sequential reactors for 6 batch cycles over 18 days. Total concentrations of ONP, MMP and PNP being degraded were 2.8 mM, 1.5 mM and 2.3 mM during this time course, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that each member in the microbial consortium was relatively stable during the entire degradation process. This study provides a novel approach to treat polluted water, particularly with a mixture of co-existed isomers. This article is protected by copyright.
