It has been proposed that many of these SNSs arise during organismal aging, prior to transformation of a normal cell into a precancerous\/cancer cell. Here, we isolated single intestinal crypts derived from normal tissue or from adenomas of Apc(min\/+) mice, expanded them minimally in\u00a0vitro as organoids, and performed exome sequencing to identify point mutations that had been acquired in\u00a0vivo at the single-cell level. SNSs, most of them being CpG-to-TpG substitutions, were at least ten times more frequent in adenoma than normal cells. Thus, contrary to the view that substitutions of this\u00a0type are present due to normal-cell aging, the acquisition of point mutations increases upon transformation of a normal intestinal cell into a precancerous cell.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Lugli, Natalia","Dionellis, Vasilis S.","Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez-Mor\u00e1n, Paloma","Kamileri, Irene","Sotiriou, Sotirios K.","Huelsken, Joerg","Halazonetis, Thanos D."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.celrep.2017.05.051","first_seen_on":"2017-06-14T13:00:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2211-1247","22111247"],"issue":"11","journal":"Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1497546366,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/fulltext\/S2211-1247(17)30708-8?sf88277920=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28614706?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28614706","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Enhanced Rate of Acquisition of Point Mutations in Mouse Intestinal Adenomas Compared to Normal Tissue","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-rate-acquisition-point-mutations-mouse-intestinal-adenomas-compared-normal-tissue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":4.5,"6m":4.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":1761199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6599049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242259,"mean":12.645961751521,"rank":66337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":175677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242259,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3970,"mean":22.828733182162,"rank":2193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3970,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247,"mean":28.761317073171,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":8,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
