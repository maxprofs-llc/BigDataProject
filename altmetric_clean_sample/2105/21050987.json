The gut microbiota provides numerous functional benefits that are crucial for human health but in the setting of a disturbed equilibrium, the microbial community can cause deleterious outcomes such as diseases and cancers. Characterization of the functional activities of human gut microbiota is fundamental to understand their roles in human health and disease. Metaproteomics, which refers to the study of the entire protein collection of the microbial community in a given sample is an emerging area of research that provides informative details concerning functional aspects of the microbiota. In this mini review, we present a summary of the progress of metaproteomic analysis for studying the functional role of gut microbiota. This is followed by an overview of the experimental approaches focusing on fecal specimen for metaproteomics and is concluded by a discussion on the challenges and future directions of metaproteomic research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000847","authors":["Pey Yee Lee","Siok-Fong Chin","Hui-min Neoh","Rahman Jamal","Lee, Pey Yee","Chin, Siok-Fong","Neoh, Hui-min","Jamal, Rahman"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12929-017-0342-z","first_seen_on":"2017-06-14T08:12:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1423-0127"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Science","last_mentioned_on":1503508875,"links":["http:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0342-z","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28606141?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0342-z?utm_content=bufferb9f24&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28606141","https:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0342-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12929-017-0342-z?site=jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28606141","pubdate":"2017-06-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"36","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Metaproteomic analysis of human gut microbiota: where are we heading?","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metaproteomic-analysis-human-gut-microbiota-we-heading"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.08,"score_history":{"1y":10.08,"6m":10.08,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":861214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7556681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244360,"mean":12.712344926931,"rank":39226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":205092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244360,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":4.2845714285714,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
