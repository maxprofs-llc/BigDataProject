They are amphiphilic proteins involved in the formation of aerial structures such as spores or fruiting bodies. They form chemically robust layers which can only be dissolved in strong acids. These layers adhere to different surfaces, changing their wettability, and allow the binding of other proteins. Herein, the modification of diverse types of surfaces with Class I hydrophobins is reported, highlighting the applications of the coated surfaces. Indeed, these coatings can be exploited in several fields, spanning from biomedical to industrial applications, which include biosensing and textile manufacturing.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef742a83ee09648b51a3","authors":["Alessandra Piscitelli","Paola Cicatiello","Alfredo Maria Gravagnuolo","Ilaria Sorrentino","Cinzia Pezzella","Paola Giardina","Piscitelli, Alessandra","Cicatiello, Paola","Gravagnuolo, Alfredo Maria","Sorrentino, Ilaria","Pezzella, Cinzia","Giardina, Paola"],"doi":"10.3390\/biom7030045","first_seen_on":"2017-06-26T13:30:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2218-273X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biomolecules","last_mentioned_on":1499257028,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-273X\/7\/3\/45?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28672843?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2218-273X\/7\/3\/45\/pdf","pmid":"28672843","pubdate":"2017-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Applications of Functional Amyloids from Fungi: Surface Modification by Class I Hydrophobins","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applications-functional-amyloids-fungi-surface-modification-class-i-hydrophobins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166903,"mean":6.9134132553505,"rank":5911656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1964536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166903,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193640,"mean":11.738708720867,"rank":124225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":57909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193640,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":4.7944700460829,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.055,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RamonElizaldeN\/statuses\/879330933433802753","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21349405],"posted_on":"2017-06-26T13:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Ramon Humberto","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/879108639642058752\/Z-OQgpTN_normal.jpg","description":"Hay una fuerza motriz m\u00e1s poderosa que el vapor, la electricidad y la energ\u00eda at\u00f3mica: la voluntad.\n@AlbertEinstein","id_on_source":"RamonElizaldeN","tweeter_id":"792248012651102208","geo":{"lt":29.0971,"ln":-110.95749,"country":"MX"},"followers":290},"tweet_id":"879330933433802753"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/882574060139331584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21349405],"posted_on":"2017-07-05T12:17:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
