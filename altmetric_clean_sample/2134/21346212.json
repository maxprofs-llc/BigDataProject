Major hurdles include limited awareness among health care workers, poor integration of TB into maternal and child health approaches, diagnostic difficulties and a lack of child-friendly treatment options. Accurate disease diagnosis is particularly difficult in young and vulnerable children who tend to develop paucibacillary disease and are unable to produce an expectorated sputum sample. In addition, access to chest radiography is problematic in resource-limited settings. Differentiating between TB exposure and M. tuberculosis infection, and especially between M. tuberculosis infection and TB disease is crucial to guide clinical management. TB represents a dynamic continuum from well-contained \"latent\" infection to incipient and ultimately severe disease. The clinical spectrum of disease in children is broad and can be confused with a myriad of common infections. We provide a pragmatic 4-step approach to diagnose intra-thoracic TB in children and demonstrate how classifying clinical, radiological and laboratory findings into recognised clinical syndromes may provide a more refined diagnostic approach, even in resource-limited settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c4","authors":["Perez-Velez, Carlos M.","Roya-Pabon, Claudia L.","Marais, Ben J."],"doi":"10.1016\/s0163-4453(17)30195-0","first_seen_on":"2017-06-26T10:06:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0163-4453","1532-2742"],"journal":"Journal of Infection","last_mentioned_on":1498471570,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28646966?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28646966","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"A systematic approach to diagnosing intra-thoracic tuberculosis in children","type":"article","volume":"74 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-approach-diagnosing-intrathoracic-tuberculosis-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":7280615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237009,"mean":12.951157100182,"rank":194250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237009,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":3.4306184738956,"rank":883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":4.2602564102564,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Staff_pubs_test\/statuses\/879279610805886976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21346212],"posted_on":"2017-06-26T10:06:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Staff pubs test","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Staff_pubs_test","tweeter_id":"781703370457448449","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"879279610805886976"}]}}
