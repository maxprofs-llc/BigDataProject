The current study was aimed to study the possible anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the methanolic extract of Agaricus blazei (A. blazei) against rotenone-induced PD in mice. Male Albino mice were randomized and divided into the following groups: control, treated with rotenone (1\u2005mg\/kg\/day), co-treated with rotenone and A. blazei (50, 100, and 200\u2005mg\/kg b.w.), and treated with A. blazei alone (200\u2005mg\/kg b.w.). After the end of the experimental period, behavioral studies, biochemical estimations, and protein expression patterns of inflammatory markers were studied. Rotenone treatment exhibited enhanced motor impairments, neurochemical deficits, oxidative stress, and inflammation, whereas oral administration of A. blazei extract attenuated the above-said indices. Even though further research is needed to prove its efficacy in clinical studies, the results of our study concluded that A. blazei extract offers a promising and new therapeutic lead for treatment of PD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003221","authors":["Veerappan Venkatesh Gobi","Srinivasagam Rajasankar","Muthu Ramkumar","Chinnasamy Dhanalakshmi","Thamilarasan Manivasagam","Arokiasamy Justin Thenmozhi","Musthafa Mohamed Essa","Ranganathan Chidambaram","Ameer Kalandar","Venkatesh Gobi, Veerappan","Rajasankar, Srinivasagam","Ramkumar, Muthu","Dhanalakshmi, Chinnasamy","Manivasagam, Thamilarasan","Justin Thenmozhi, Arokiasamy","Essa, Musthafa Mohamed","Chidambaram, Ranganathan","Kalandar, Ameer"],"doi":"10.1080\/1028415x.2017.1337290","first_seen_on":"2017-06-26T02:10:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1028-415X","1476-8305"],"journal":"Nutritional Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1505804930,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/1028415X.2017.1337290#.WVBsp2joOv4.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28628424"],"pmid":"28628424","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Agaricus blazei extract abrogates rotenone-induced dopamine depletion and motor deficits by its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in Parkinsonic mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agaricus-blazei-extract-abrogates-rotenoneinduced-dopamine-depletion-motor-deficits-antioxidative-an"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":3668321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4646886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237568,"mean":12.96120392142,"rank":98057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":135579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237568,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":11.66650310559,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":31.460625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
