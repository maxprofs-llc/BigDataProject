There was no difference in the micronucleus frequency of mice on normal diet (cereal-based, non-purified diet) and mice on normal diet supplemented with microwaved meat. However, supplementing the normal diet with well-done pan-fried meat or rare charcoal-barbecued meat or well-done charcoal-barbecued meat produced significant increments in the micronucleus frequency of polychromatic erythrocytes--the increments were of the order of 73% (p = 0.045), 90% (p = 0.047) and 136% (p = 0.001) respectively and they were observed after a 21-day feeding trial. These results suggest that ingestion of well-done pan-fried or barbecued meat may increase genetic damage, however, the accompanying decreased intake of vegetable constituents may have also contributed to the observed changes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","authors":["Fenech, M","Neville, S"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T21:26:57+00:00","issns":["0027-5107"],"issue":"1","journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1466457998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1371588"],"pmid":"1371588","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Micronucleus induction in bone-marrow cells following consumption of cooked beef in mice.
