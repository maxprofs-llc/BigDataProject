The purpose of this article is to better understand the dynamics of older people's demand for hospital care over time in a cross-country setting.\nWe used data from the Survey on Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), in 10 countries between 2004 and 2011.\nWe estimated a dynamic panel model of hospital admission for respondents aged 50 years or more.\nFollowing prior research, we found evidence of state dependence in hospital use over time. We also found that rise in frailty-among other health covariates-is a strong predictor of increased hospital use. Progression by one point on the frailty scale [0;5] is associated with an additional risk of about 2.1 percent on average.\nOur results support promotion of early detection of frailty in primary care, and improvement of coordination between actors within the health system, as potential strategies to reduce avoidable or unnecessary hospital use among frail elderly.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029c5","authors":["Sirven, Nicolas","Rapp, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1111\/1475-6773.12518","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T22:50:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1475-6773"],"journal":"Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1469693707,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/1475-6773.12518#.V2hzJ3rZ5io.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1475-6773.12518\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1475-6773.12518\/pdf","pmid":"27319798","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"The Dynamics of Hospital Use among Older People Evidence for Europe Using SHARE Data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamics-hospital-among-older-people-evidence-europe-using-share-data-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":3520260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4512957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264170,"mean":11.669389481733,"rank":104868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":154608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264170,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1224,"mean":11.225156173344,"rank":907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1224,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":21.487473684211,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CathyFarrow1\/statuses\/745026037961023489","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8933256],"posted_on":"2016-06-20T22:50:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Cathy Farrow","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/878245127222837250\/0OlZtSrZ_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets about Gerontology, Ovarian Cancer, Indigenous Health, Healthcare Education & Safety, & Global Health (including eliminating FGM) and the occasional fun.","id_on_source":"CathyFarrow1","tweeter_id":"588330753","geo":{"lt":50.36386,"ln":-119.34997,"country":"CA"},"followers":366},"tweet_id":"745026037961023489"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSR_HRET\/statuses\/748501620149919744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8933256],"posted_on":"2016-06-30T13:01:07+00:00","author":{"name":"HealthServResearch","url":"http:\/\/www.hsr.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/449619609079914496\/L94ZYA2R_normal.jpeg","description":"Health Services Research (HSR ) is HRET's flagship publication and an official journal of AcademyHealth","id_on_source":"HSR_HRET","tweeter_id":"2290450088","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":599},"tweet_id":"748501620149919744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/grimonprezf\/statuses\/758576507304292353","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8933256],"posted_on":"2016-07-28T08:15:07+00:00","author":{"name":"F\u044fan\u00e7ois G\u044fimonp\u044fez","url":"http:\/\/fr.linkedin.com\/in\/grimonprezf","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778972053563121664\/hRY9n2sy_normal.jpg","description":"Directeur \u00e0 l'Agence R\u00e9gionale de #Sant\u00e9 @ars_pdl | Director at Regional #Health Agency  | Engineer & Health #Economist | #VBHC #eHealth #Innovation #Dissensus","id_on_source":"grimonprezf","tweeter_id":"433227990","geo":{"lt":47.21725,"ln":-1.55336,"country":"FR"},"followers":1983},"tweet_id":"758576507304292353"}]}}
