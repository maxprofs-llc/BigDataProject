Our aim was to determine the optimal dose of calcium for treatment of children with rickets. Sixty-five Nigerian children with radiographically-confirmed rickets were randomized to daily supplemental calcium intake of 500\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u200921), 1000\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u200923), or 2000\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u200921). Venous blood, radiographs, and forearm areal bone density (aBMD) were obtained at baseline and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks after enrollment. The primary outcome was radiographic healing, using a 10-point radiographic severity score. The radiographic severity scores improved in all three groups, but the rate of radiographic healing (points per month) was significantly more rapid in the 1000\u2009mg (-0.29; 95%CI -0.13 to -0.45) and 2000\u2009mg (-0.36; -0.19 to -0.53) supplementation groups relative to the 500\u2009mg group. The 2000\u2009mg group did not heal more rapidly than the 1000\u2009mg group. After 24 weeks, 12 (67%), 20 (87%), and 14 (67%) in the 2000\u2009mg, 1000\u2009mg, and 500\u2009mg groups, respectively, had achieved a radiographic score of 1.5 or less (P\u2009=\u20090.21).Serum alkaline phosphatase decreased and calcium increased similarly in all groups. Forearm diaphyseal aBMD improved significantly more rapidly in the 2000\u2009mg group than in the 500\u2009mg and 1000\u2009mg groups (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Daily calcium intakes of 1000\u2009mg or 2000\u2009mg produced more rapid radiographic healing of rickets than 500\u2009mg, but 2000\u2009mg did not have greater benefit than 1000\u2009mg. Some children require longer than 24 weeks for complete healing of nutritional rickets. This article is protected by copyright.
