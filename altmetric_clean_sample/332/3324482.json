Barriers to fragmentation as well as the associated overall energy differences are computed for the observed Calpha-C backbone bond cleavage as well as for side-chain loss for a variety of side chains (valine, arginine, glutamic acid, and tyrosine). It is found that Calpha-C bond cleavage is favored over side-chain loss, although loss of a tyrosine side chain may compete with Calpha-C cleavage because the tyrosine radical formed can delocalize its unpaired electron over its aromatic ring. In addition, it is found that fragmentation of the nitrogen-centered radicals formed in EDD results in cleavage to produce so-called a*\/x fragments rather than a\/x* fragments both because producing the former involves a significantly smaller barrier and is nearly thermoneutral, while cleavage to yield a\/x* is significantly endothermic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Iwona Anusiewicz,\u2020,\u2021","Anusiewicz I","Jasionowski M","Skurski P","Simons J"],"doi":"10.1021\/jp055018g","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T20:14:14+00:00","issns":["1089-5639"],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1258810890,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp055018g","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16331920"],"pmid":"16331920","pubdate":"2005-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
