An injectable formulation is already marketed for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced breast cancer (ABC). A new oral form has been developed and its file registration is being submitted. As part of its development, a clinical study was conducted to determine the absolute bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of oral vinorelbine administered as softgel capsules, and to evaluate its safety profile compared with intravenous administration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","authors":["M.
