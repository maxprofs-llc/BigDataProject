Detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of these enzymes can be expected to guide the design of new antibacterial compounds resistant to their action. A number of high-resolution structures are available for class A beta-lactamases, whose catalytic mechanism involves the acylation of a serine residue at the active site. The identity of the general base which participates in the activation of this serine residue during catalysis has been the subject of controversy, both a lysine residue and a glutamic acid residue having been proposed as candidates for this role. We have used the pH dependence of chemical modification of epsilon-amino groups by 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzenesulfonate and the pH dependence of the epsilon-methylene 1H and 13C chemical shifts (in enzyme selectively labeled with [epsilon-13C]lysine) to estimate the pKa of the relevant lysine residue, lysine-73, of TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Both methods show that the pKa of this residue is > 10, making it very unlikely that this residue could act as a proton acceptor in catalysis. An alternative mechanism in which this role is performed by glutamate-166 through an intervening water molecule is described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1996PNAS...93.1747D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["C Damblon","X Raquet","L Y Lian","J Lamotte-Brasseur","E Fonze","P Charlier","G C Roberts","J M Fr\u00e8re"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.93.5.1747","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T21:53:39+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1382887682,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.93.5.1747","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8700829"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/5\/1747.full.pdf","pmid":"8700829","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catalytic-mechanism-betalactamases-nmr-titration-activesite-lysine-residue-tem1-enzyme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94240,"mean":8.094532942837,"rank":24433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94240,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33585,"mean":13.629233444497,"rank":12994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33585,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":38.454532894737,"rank":554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
