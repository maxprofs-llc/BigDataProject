The presence of tracks unambiguously confirms the extraterrestrial nature of IDP's, and the high track densities (10(10) to 10(11) per square centimeter) suggest an exposure age of approximately 10(4) years within the inner solar system. Tracks also provide an upper temperature limit for the heating of IDP's during atmospheric entry, thereby making it possible to distinguish between pristine and thermally modified micrometeorites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1984Sci...226.1432B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["J.
