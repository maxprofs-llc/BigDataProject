Thick blood film examinations indicated that 48.5% of children (49\/101) and 32.4% of adults (34\/105) were infected at least once by Plasmodium ovale during the study period; 148 distinct episodes of patent parasitaemia were observed, with estimated maximum durations of 3-115 d. The mean duration at first decreased significantly with age, from 11.4 d in children under 5 years old to 4.2 d in adults aged 40-59 years, but then increased in older adults to 7.0 d. In all age groups, most infections were asymptomatic. Only high parasitaemias were significantly associated with fever; 3 clinical malaria attacks due to P. ovale were seen during the study period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005d24","authors":["Farba B.K.
