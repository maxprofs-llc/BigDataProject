These stimuli are sensed by two kinds of receptors: osmoreceptor-Na+ receptors and volume or pressure receptors. This information is conveyed to specific areas of the central nervous system responsible for an integrated response, which depends on the integrity of the anteroventral region of the third ventricle, e.g., organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, and subfornical organ. The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of body fluid homeostasis by secreting vasopressin and oxytocin in response to osmotic and nonosmotic stimuli. Since the discovery of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a large number of publications have demonstrated that this peptide provides a potent defense mechanism against volume overload in mammals, including humans. ANP is mostly localized in the heart, but ANP and its receptor are also found in hypothalamic and brain stem areas involved in body fluid volume and blood pressure regulation. Blood volume expansion acts not only directly on the heart, by stretch of atrial myocytes to increase the release of ANP, but also on the brain ANPergic neurons through afferent inputs from baroreceptors. Angiotensin II also plays an important role in the regulation of body fluids, being a potent inducer of thirst and, in general, antagonizes the actions of ANP. This review emphasizes the role played by brain ANP and its interaction with neurohypophysial hormones in the control of body fluid homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037c7","authors":["JOS\u00c9 ANTUNES-RODRIGUES","MARGARET DE CASTRO","LUCILA L.
