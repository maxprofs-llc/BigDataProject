Two samples of extracted primary molars (sample 1, n = 38; sample 2, n = 69) were evaluated independently by 2 examiners. In this in vitro study, evaluation of plaque in the Nyvad system was not possible. Histology (sample 2) was used to validate lesion depth. Area under ROC curves (A(z)), sensitivity, specificity and percent agreement of both systems were calculated at D1, D2 and D3 thresholds. Both systems showed kappa for intra- and inter-examiner agreement >0.86 and good correlation with histology: Spearman rho = 0.73 (Nyvad) and 0.78 (ICDAS-II). They presented similar performances except that ICDAS-II showed significantly higher sensitivity (Nyvad 0.89; ICDAS 0.92) and A(z) (Nyvad 0.85; ICDAS 0.90) for the D1 threshold. The correlation between the systems for lesion activity (Cramer's V) was 0.71. Therefore, both visual systems are reliable and can estimate caries lesion depth on primary teeth. Under in vitro conditions, there is no major difference between the Nyvad system and Lesion Activity Assessment in assessing caries activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024b4","authors":["Braga, M.M.","Mendes, F.M.","Martignon, S.","Ricketts, D.N.J.","Ekstrand, K.R."],"doi":"10.1159\/000239755","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T21:44:23+00:00","issns":["1421-976X"],"journal":"Caries Research","last_mentioned_on":1423067396,"links":["http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Abstract\/239755"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.karger.com\/Article\/Pdf\/239755","pmid":"19776572","pubdate":"2009-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"In vitro Comparison of Nyvad\u2019s System and ICDAS-II with Lesion Activity Assessment for Evaluation of Severity and Activity of Occlusal Caries Lesions in Primary Teeth","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-comparison-nyvads-system-icdasii-lesion-activity-assessment-evaluation-severity-activity-occlu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715210,"mean":5.6976580270372,"rank":2507792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1565177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715210,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164530,"mean":8.7702932978384,"rank":86933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164530,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230,"mean":3.061711790393,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.659375,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
