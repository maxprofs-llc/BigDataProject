The genetic defect in SDS has recently been identified; causative mutations have been shown in the SBDS gene. The aims of this study were to characterize the nature, frequency, and age-related changes of radiographic skeletal abnormalities in patients with SBDS mutations and to assess genotype-phenotype correlation. Fifteen patients (mean age 9.7 years) with a clinical diagnosis of SDS and documented SBDS gene mutations were included. Review of their skeletal radiographs showed abnormalities in all patients. The skeletal changes were variable, even in patients with identical genotypes. The typical features were (1) delayed appearance of secondary ossification centers, (2) variable widening and irregularity of the metaphyses in early childhood, followed by progressive thickening and irregularity of the growth plates, and (3) generalized osteopenia. There was a tendency towards normalization of the epiphyseal maturation defect and progression of the metaphyseal changes with age. The results suggest that the characteristic skeletal changes are present in all patients with SDS and SBDS mutations, but their severity and localization varies with age. No phenotype-genotype correlation was observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002559","authors":["M\u00e4kitie O","Ellis L","Durie PR","Morrison JA","Sochett EB","Rommens JM","Cole WG"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T19:55:15+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1262884220,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14984468"],"pmid":"14984468","pubdate":"2004-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Skeletal phenotype in patients with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and mutations in SBDS.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skeletal-phenotype-patients-schwachmandiamond-syndrome-mutations-sbds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3992024,"mean":5.0370515321327,"rank":917675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2527392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3992024,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124228,"mean":8.9963051423237,"rank":37440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124228,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":891,"mean":2.3958898876404,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":891,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.2866666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
