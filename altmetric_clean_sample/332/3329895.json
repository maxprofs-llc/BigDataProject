Closed patch tests with all the ingredients of the cream revealed positive reactions to cetyl alcohol 30% to 5% pet. Gas chromatographic analysis of the cetyl alcohol in the cream base detected stearyl alcohol (C18), myristyl alcohol (C14) and lauryl alcohol (C12) in addition to the main component of cetyl alcohol (C16). Patch testing with 99% pure analytical reagent grade saturated alcohols (C10, C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C17, C18, C19, C20) showed negative reactions. Thus, it is concluded that some minor impurities in cetyl alcohol not detected by gas chromatography might be the cause of this dermatitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000260f","authors":["H Komamura","T Doi","S Inui","K Yoshikawa"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T22:19:33+00:00","issns":["0105-1873"],"issue":"1","journal":"Contact Dermatitis (01051873)","last_mentioned_on":1348064103,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9034687"],"pmid":"9034687","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"A case of contact dermatitis due to impurities of cetyl alcohol.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-contact-dermatitis-due-impurities-cetyl-alcohol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":816833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94005,"mean":8.0726803114763,"rank":24330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94005,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.23624,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.9409090909091,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cetyl alcohol","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=513537387#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3329894,3329895],"posted_on":"2012-09-19T14:15:03+00:00","summary":"Cetyl alcohol, also known as 1-hexadecanol and palmityl alcohol, is a fatty alcohol with the formula CH3(CH2)15OH.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=2394627","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Edgar181","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Edgar181"}}]}}
