The crystal structure of the enzyme from chicken muscle has been determined at a resolution of 2.5 A, and an independent determination of the structure of the yeast enzyme has just been completed at 3 A resolution. The conformation of the polypeptide chain is essentially identical in the two structures, and consists of an inner cylinder of eight strands of parallel beta-pleated sheet, with mostly helical segments connecting each strand. The active site is a pocket containing glutamic acid 165, which is believed to act as a base in the reaction. Crystallographic studies of the binding of DHAP to both the chicken and the yeast enzymes reveal a common mode of binding and suggest a mechanisms for catalysis involving polarization of the substrate carbonyl group.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1981RSPTB.293..159A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032f2","authors":["T.
