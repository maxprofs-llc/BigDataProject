Not only can RYGB result in vitamin D malabsorption, but also the bypassed duodenum and proximal jejunum are the predominant sites of active, transcellular, 1,25(OH)2 D-mediated calcium (Ca) uptake. However, Ca absorption occurs throughout the intestine, and those who undergo RYGB might maintain sufficient Ca absorption, particularly if vitamin D status and Ca intake are robust. We determined the effects of RYGB on intestinal fractional Ca absorption (FCA) while maintaining ample 25OHD levels (goal \u226530\u2009ng\/mL) and Ca intake (1200\u2009mg daily) in a prospective cohort of 33 obese adults (BMI 44.7\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\u2009kg\/m(2) ). FCA was measured pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively with a dual stable isotope method. Other measures included calciotropic hormones, bone turnover markers, and BMD by DXA and QCT. Mean 6-month weight loss was 32.5\u2009\u00b1\u20098.4\u2009kg (25.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2% of pre-operative weight). FCA decreased from 32.7%\u2009\u00b1\u200914.0% pre-operatively to 6.9%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8% post-operatively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), despite median (interquartile range) 25OHD levels of 41.0 (33.1-48.5) and 36.5 (28.8-40.4) ng\/mL, respectively. Consistent with the FCA decline, 24-hour urinary Ca decreased, PTH increased, and 1,25(OH)2 D increased (p\u22640.02). Bone turnover markers increased markedly, areal BMD decreased at the proximal femur, and volumetric BMD decreased at the spine (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Those with lower post-operative FCA had greater increases in serum CTx (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009-0.43, p\u2009=\u20090.01). Declines in FCA and BMD were not correlated over the 6 months. In conclusion, FCA decreased dramatically after RYGB, even with most 25OHD levels \u226530\u2009ng\/mL and with recommended Ca intake. RYGB patients may need high Ca intakes to prevent perturbations in Ca homeostasis, although the approach to Ca supplementation needs further study. Decline in FCA could contribute to the decline in BMD after RYGB, and strategies to avoid long-term skeletal consequences should be investigated. This article is protected by copyright.
