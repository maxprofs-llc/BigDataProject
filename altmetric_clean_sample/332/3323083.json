To initiate investigations during pregnancy, 16 healthy pregnant women scheduled for cesarean delivery received a single application of TFV gel preoperatively. Maternal serum drug concentrations were determined and fetal cord blood, amniotic fluid, placental tissue, and endometrial tissue specimens were collected. The median maternal peak concentration and cord blood TFV concentrations were 4.3 and 1.9 ng\/mL, respectively (\u223c100- and 40-fold lower than after TFV oral dosing, respectively). No adverse events were related to the use of TFV gel. These findings support ongoing and future investigations of TFV gel in pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Beigi R","Noguchi L","Parsons T","Macio I","Kunjara Na Ayudhya RP","Chen J","Hendrix CW","M\u00e2sse B","Valentine M","Piper J","Watts DH"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jir562","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T19:24:19+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1423070775,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21930612"],"pmid":"21930612","pubdate":"2011-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Pharmacokinetics and placental transfer of single-dose tenofovir 1% vaginal gel in term pregnancy.","type":"article","volume":"204","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetics-placental-transfer-singledose-tenofovir-1-vaginal-gel-term-pregnancy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4755476,"mean":5.7098704369194,"rank":3180923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1386982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4755476,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167986,"mean":8.6937413459537,"rank":109599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":50850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167986,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3432,"mean":5.8717400174876,"rank":2555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3432,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":3.3982580645161,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"CZ":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/astuebe\/status\/563022425999552512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3323083],"posted_on":"2015-02-04T17:13:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Alison Stuebe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/830506210747174914\/Y4CoQM_V_normal.jpg","description":"High risk obstetrician, aspiring midwife, breastfeeding researcher and advocate, mom of three.
