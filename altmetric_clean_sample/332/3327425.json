Because the nucleocapsid proteins (N) interact with 6 nucleotides, an exact nucleotide-N match at the RNA 3'-OH end (3'-OH congruence) may be required for recognition of an active replication promoter. Alternatively, assuming that the six positions for the interaction of N with the nucleotides are not equivalent, the nucleotide position relative to N may be critical (N phase context). The replication abilities of various minireplicons, designed so that the 3'-OH congruence could be discriminated from the N phase context, were studied. The results strongly suggest that the application of the rule of six depends on the recognition of nucleotides positioned in the proper N phase context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Diane Vulli\u00e9moz","Laurent Roux"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.75.10.4506-4518.2001","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T21:23:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1098-5514","0022-538X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1332357253,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.75.10.4506-4518.2001","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11312321","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC114204"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/75\/10\/4506.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC114204","pmid":"11312321","pubdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"\u201cRule of Six\u201d: How Does the Sendai Virus RNA Polymerase Keep Count?","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rule-six-sendai-virus-rna-polymerase-keep-count"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624910,"mean":4.93387576623,"rank":816582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93196,"mean":7.419678695209,"rank":23716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93196,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4377,"mean":3.0083404936015,"rank":618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4377,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.6787021276596,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
