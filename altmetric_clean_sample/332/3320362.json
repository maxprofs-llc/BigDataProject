This seems to be the first case of successful treatment of keratomycosis with thiabendazole. All other reported cases treated with this drug either had their eyes removed or did not retain any useful vision. Its ability to penetrate ocular tissues, ability to remain in concentrations higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration of many fungi, and broad spectrum of activity make it a worthwhile drug for further investigation in keratomycosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244f","authors":["M P Upadhyay","E P West","A P Sharma"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjo.64.1.30","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T15:45:50+00:00","issns":["1468-2079","0007-1161"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1235433356,"links":["http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6766732","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bjo.64.1.30","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6766732","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1039343"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/64\/1\/30.full.pdf","pmid":"6766732","pubdate":"1980-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"30","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Keratitis due to Aspergillus flavus successfully treated with thiabendazole.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/keratitis-due-aspergillus-flavus-successfully-treated-thiabendazole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94483,"mean":8.109720073665,"rank":24553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94483,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1385,"mean":2.2996690751445,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1385,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.8666666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
