On the basis of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequence, the strain was identified as Bacillus safensis DVL-43 (Gen-bank accession number KC156603). Optimization of fermentation medium using Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology led to 11.4-fold increase in lipase production. The lipase from B. safensis DVL-43 exhibited excellent stability in various organic solvents. The enzyme retained 100% activity after 24h incubation in xylene, DMSO and toluene, each solvent being used at a concentration of 25% (v\/v). The use of partially purified DVL-43 lipase as catalyst in the synthesis of ethyl laurate, an esterification product of lauric acid and ethanol, resulted in 80% esterification in 12h under optimized conditions. The formation of ethyl laurate was confirmed using TLC and (1)H NMR. Organic solvent stable lipases exhibiting potential application in enzymatic esterification are in great demand in flavor, fine chemicals and pharma industries. We could not find any report on lipase production from B. safensis strain and its application in esterification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b27","authors":["Kumar D","Parshad R","Gupta VK"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijbiomac.2014.02.015","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T20:52:23+00:00","issns":["0141-8130"],"journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1399833576,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijbiomac.2014.02.015"],"pmid":"24534493","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Application of a statistically enhanced, novel, organic solvent stable lipase from Bacillus safensis DVL-43.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-statistically-enhanced-novel-organic-solvent-stable-lipase-bacillus-safensis-dvl43"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3736810,"mean":4.9815094824789,"rank":849743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2363552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3736810,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109557,"mean":8.7789986673483,"rank":31643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":76654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109557,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267,"mean":1.6776616541353,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.0458333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
