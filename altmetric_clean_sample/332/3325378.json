(Z.

This catalyst exhibits a higher intrinsic OER activity, a smaller Tafel slope and better stability than the state-of-the-art precious-metal IrO2 catalyst and the well-known BSCF perovskite. The mass activity and stability are further improved by ball milling. Several factors including the optimized eg orbital filling, good ionic and charge transfer abilities, as well as high OH(-) adsorption and O2 desorption capabilities possibly contribute to the excellent OER activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Zhu, Yinlong","Zhou, Wei","Chen, Zhi\u2010Gang","Chen, Yubo","Su, Chao","Tad\u00e9, Moses O.","Shao, Zongping","Yinlong Zhu","Wei Zhou","Zhi-Gang Chen","Yubo Chen","Chao Su","Moses O.
