Effective rehabilitation programmes need to be developed and therapeutic aspects understood.\nTo explore and describe how persons with stroke experience their RTW process while participating in a person-centred rehabilitation programme focusing on RTW.\nSeven persons with mild or moderate stroke were interviewed twice during the intervention in the vocational training phase using semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using grounded theory.\nHaving a coordinator by their side gave support and guidance during the RTW process. Knowledge of stroke, strategies and a straightforward communication created a structure for the RTW process. Expressing one's own wishes increased opportunities to influence and decide which path to follow in order to reach the goal.\nStraightforward, open and recurring communication facilitated the possibility to adapt to the situation. These aspects increased insight and awareness which facilitated the RTW process.\nThe findings indicate that a precondition for a fruitful RTW process was that suitable platforms at work were created in which the actors involved could cooperate. This knowledge might also be valuable in the RTW process for people with other diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f61000458e","authors":["\u00d6st Nilsson, Annika","Eriksson, Gunilla","Johansson, Ulla","Hellman, Therese","Annika \u00d6st Nilsson","Gunilla Eriksson","Ulla Johansson","Therese Hellman"],"doi":"10.1080\/11038128.2016.1249404","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-11-20T06:09:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-2014","1103-8128"],"journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1486224303,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/11038128.2016.1249404","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/11038128.2016.1249404?af=R"],"pmid":"27835933","pubdate":"2016-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Experiences of the return to work process after stroke while participating in a person-centred rehabilitation programme","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/11038128.2016.1249404","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experiences-return-work-process-after-stroke-while-participating-personcentred-rehabilitation-progra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":4087976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3864934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267964,"mean":12.057998499792,"rank":135994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":122669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267964,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":2.4693298429319,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.8857142857143,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
