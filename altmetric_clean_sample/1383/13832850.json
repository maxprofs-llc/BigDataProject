The condition was refractory to phenobarbital, pyridoxine, pyridoxal phosphate and levetiracetam, but a dramatic response to an intravenous loading dose of phenytoin was documented by video-EEG monitoring. Over weeks phenytoin was successfully switched to carbamazepine to prevent seizure relapses associated with difficulty in maintaining proper blood levels of phenytoin. Genetic analysis identified a novel de novo heterozygous mutation (c.[4633A>G]p.[Met1545Val]) in SCN2A. At two years and three months of age the patient is still seizure-free on carbamazepine, although a developmental delay is evident.\nSodium channel blockers represent the first-line treatment for confirmed or suspected SCN2A-related epileptic encephalopathies. In severe cases with compatible electro-clinical features we propose a treatment algorithm based on a test trial with high dose intravenous phenytoin followed in case of a positive response by carbamazepine, more suitable for long-term maintenance treatment. Because of their rarity, collaborative studies are needed to delineate shared therapeutic protocols for EIEE based on the electro-clinical features and the presumed underlying genetic substrate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Robertino Dilena","Pasquale Striano","Elena Gennaro","Laura Bassi","Sara Olivotto","Laura Tadini","Fabio Mosca","Sergio Barbieri","Federico Zara","Monica Fumagalli","Dilena, Robertino","Striano, Pasquale","Gennaro, Elena","Bassi, Laura","Olivotto, Sara","Tadini, Laura","Mosca, Fabio","Barbieri, Sergio","Zara, Federico","Fumagalli, Monica"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2016.10.015","first_seen_on":"2016-11-20T06:02:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03877604","1872-7131","0387-7604"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1491010686,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S038776041630184X&_version=1&md5=987bd826d0d08b637c8ebc1fbcb4a228","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27876397","http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S0387-7604%2816%2930184-X\/fulltext#.WKGHrkxaHZI.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27876397?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.brainanddevelopment.com\/article\/S038776041630184X\/pdf","pmid":"27876397","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Efficacy of sodium channel blockers in SCN2A early infantile epileptic encephalopathy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S038776041630184X","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-sodium-channel-blockers-scn2a-early-infantile-epileptic-encephalopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":3335469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5073791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284138,"mean":11.836226355596,"rank":100751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":181358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284138,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":2.2227303543914,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.97962962962963,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
