In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo studies show that GBA1 mutations reduce glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity and are associated with increased \u03b1-synuclein levels, reflecting similar changes seen in idiopathic PD brain. We have developed a neural crest stem cell-derived dopaminergic neuronal model that recapitulates biochemical abnormalities in GBA1 mutation-associated PD. Cells showed reduced GCase protein and activity, impaired macroautophagy, and increased \u03b1-synuclein levels. Advantages of this approach include easy access to stem cells, no requirement to reprogram, and retention of the intact host genome. Treatment with a GCase chaperone increased GCase protein levels and activity, rescued the autophagic defects, and decreased \u03b1-synuclein levels. These results provide the basis for further investigation of GCase chaperones or similar drugs to slow the progression of PD.","altmetric_jid":"52d5438d3cf05876028b4567","authors":["Shi-Yu Yang","Michelle Beavan","Kai-Yin Chau","Jan-Willem Taanman","Anthony H.V.
