Our meta-analysis revealed that IL-17 levels were significantly higher in the RA group than in the control group (p=3.1\u00d710(-6)). Subgroup analysis using sample size showed increased IL-17 levels in samples from both small (n\u2264100) and large (n>100) RA groups (p=1.1\u00d710(-4) and p=0.008, respectively). We found evidence of associations between RA and alleles from the IL-17A rs2275913 and IL-17F rs763780 polymorphisms in Caucasians (p=0.003 and p=0.037, respectively). In addition, we found an association between RA and alleles of the IL-17A rs3819024 polymorphism in the pooled RA cohort compared with matched controls (p=0.033). However, no evidence of association was found between the IL-17F rs2397084, IL-17A rs4711998 and IL-17A rs8193036 polymorphisms and RA susceptibility.\nOur meta-analysis revealed significantly higher circulating IL-17 levels in patients with RA, and found evidence of associations between the IL-17A rs2275913, IL-17F rs763780 and IL-17A rs3819024 polymorphisms and pathogenesis of RA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003370","authors":["Young Ho Lee","Sang-Cheol Bae"],"doi":"10.1136\/postgradmedj-2016-134637","first_seen_on":"2017-01-13T17:21:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-0756"],"journal":"Postgraduate Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1484339862,"links":["http:\/\/pmj.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/01\/09\/postgradmedj-2016-134637?utm_content=bufferb9770&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/pmj.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/01\/09\/postgradmedj-2016-134637?utm_content=bufferbc130&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pmj.bmj.com\/content\/postgradmedj\/early\/2017\/01\/09\/postgradmedj-2016-134637.full.pdf","pmid":"28069745","pubdate":"2017-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"postgradmedj-2016-134637","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Associations between circulating IL-17 levels and rheumatoid arthritis and between IL-17 gene polymorphisms and disease susceptibility: a meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-circulating-il17-levels-rheumatoid-arthritis-between-il17-gene-polymorphisms-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":4268079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2237612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255048,"mean":12.814899708681,"rank":144190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":85870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255048,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1474,"mean":7.9939293957909,"rank":1033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1474,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":9.88125,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
