We solved the crystal structure of this acetylated MnSOD (MnSODLys68AcK), thus revealing the structural and electrostatic basis for the significant activity decrease upon Lys68 acetylation. On the basis of an assay we developed for the SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of MnSODLys68AcK, we identified a novel SIRT3 activator, 7-hydroxy-3-(4'-methoxyphenyl) coumarin, which binds to SIRT3 with high affinity and can promote the deacetylation and activation of MnSOD. C12 adds to the current repertoire of extremely few SIRT3 activators, which are potentially valuable for treating a wide array of diseases via modulating the cellular acetylome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002911","authors":["Jiaqi Lu","Hua Zhang","Xian Chen","Yong Zou","Jiasong Li","Li Wang","Minhao Wu","Jianye Zang","Yang Yu","Wei Zhuang","Qing Xia","Jiangyun Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.freeradbiomed.2017.07.012","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T19:27:23+00:00","issns":["08915849"],"journal":"Free Radical Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506626830,"links":["https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891584917306846?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb&dgcid=raven_sd_via_email"],"pmid":"28711502","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biochemistry"],"title":"A small molecule activator of SIRT3 promotes deacetylation and activation of manganese superoxide dismutase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/small-molecule-activator-sirt3-promotes-deacetylation-activation-manganese-superoxide-dismutase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0.5,"6d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":6420835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113839,"mean":11.508582564697,"rank":79740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":21330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113839,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1817,"mean":4.6029063876652,"rank":1274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1817,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":12.066636363636,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RickDomann\/statuses\/913485250440949762","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26712186],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T19:27:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Rick Domann","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/455817707233869824\/eZ_Zwv30_normal.jpeg","description":"Man in the Maize","id_on_source":"RickDomann","tweeter_id":"2436028716","geo":{"lt":42.00027,"ln":-93.50049,"country":"US"},"followers":708},"tweet_id":"913485250440949762"}]}}
