This study aimed to estimate the association between \u03b2-cell dysfunction and prognosis of nondiabetic patients with ischemic stroke.\nPatients with ischemic stroke without a history of diabetes mellitus in the ACROSS-China (Abnormal Glucose Regulation in Patients with Acute Stroke across China) registry were included. Disposition index was estimated as computer-based model of homeostatic model assessment 2-\u03b2%\/homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance based on fasting C-peptide level. Outcomes included stroke recurrence, all-cause death, and dependency (modified Rankin Scale, 3-5) at 12 months after onset.\nAmong 1171 patients, 37.2% were women with a mean age of 62.4 years. At 12 months, 167 (14.8%) patients had recurrent stroke, 110 (9.4%) died, and 184 (16.0%) had a dependency. The first quartile of the disposition index was associated with an increased risk of stroke recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.57; 95% confidence interval, 2.13-5.99) and dependency (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.38); both the first and second quartiles of the disposition index were associated with an increased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 5.09; 95% confidence interval, 2.51-10.33; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.03) compared with the fourth quartile. Using a multivariable regression model with restricted cubic spline, we observed an L-shaped association between the disposition index and the risk of each end point.\nIn this large-scale registry, \u03b2-cell dysfunction was associated with an increased risk of 12-month poor prognosis in nondiabetic patients with ischemic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["Yuesong Pan","Weiqi Chen","Jing Jing","Huaguang Zheng","Qian Jia","Hao Li","Xingquan Zhao","Liping Liu","Yongjun Wang","Yan He","Yilong Wang"],"doi":"10.1161\/strokeaha.117.018203","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T20:00:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0039-2499","1524-4628"],"journal":"Stroke","last_mentioned_on":1506704732,"links":["http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2017\/09\/27\/STROKEAHA.117.018203"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org\/content\/strokeaha\/early\/2017\/09\/27\/STROKEAHA.117.018203.full.pdf","pmid":"28954919","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Pancreatic \u03b2-Cell Function and Prognosis of Nondiabetic Patients With Ischemic Stroke","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":0.75,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4523127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113854,"mean":11.512140760454,"rank":60769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":41121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113854,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5967,"mean":10.652123365739,"rank":4090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5967,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":8.352380952381,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StrokeAHA_ASA\/statuses\/913493664315461634","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26713103],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T20:00:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Stroke AHA\/ASA","url":"http:\/\/stroke.ahajournals.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/660165179758542849\/LPox9mzx_normal.png","description":"Stroke publishes peer-reviewed research for academics & clinicians.
