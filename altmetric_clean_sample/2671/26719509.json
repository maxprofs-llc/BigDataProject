In rats, frequency modulated 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (hedonic 50\u2009kHz) reflect a positive affective state and are best elicited by rough-and-tumble play. A well-established rat chronic unpredictable stress paradigm was used to produce a robust and long-lasting decrease in positive affect, increase in negative affect, and learned helplessness in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rough-and-tumble play (3\u2009min every 3 days) reversed stress-induced effects of chronic unpredictable stress in the Porsolt forced swim test, novelty-induced hypophagia, sucrose preference, and ultrasonic vocalization assays compared with a light touch control group. These data demonstrate that positive affect induces resilience to stress effects in rats, and that rough-and-tumble play can be used to explore the biological basis of resilience that may lead to the development of new therapeutics for stress-related disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082af","authors":["Burgdorf, Jeffrey","Kroes, Roger A.","Moskal, Joseph R."],"doi":"10.1097\/wnr.0000000000000864","first_seen_on":"2017-09-28T23:12:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0959-4965","1473-558X"],"journal":"NeuroReport","last_mentioned_on":1506640354,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Rough_and_tumble_play_induces_resilience_to_stress.98489.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/9000\/00000\/Rough_and_tumble_play_induces_resilience_to_stress.98489.pdf","pmid":"28957945","pubdate":"2017-09-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Rough-and-tumble play induces resilience to stress in rats.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/neuroreport\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Rough_and_tumble_play_induces_resilience_to_stress.98489.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":7311920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113847,"mean":11.508553853451,"rank":92513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113847,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1702,"mean":3.9694485596708,"rank":1462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1702,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.7244736842105,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroReport\/statuses\/913541974182916096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26719509],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T23:12:34+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroReport","url":"http:\/\/www.neuroreport.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/826084196036857861\/YhtvNa9Z_normal.jpg","description":"NeuroReport is a channel for rapid communication of new findings in neuroscience.","id_on_source":"NeuroReport","tweeter_id":"482085355","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":941},"tweet_id":"913541974182916096"}]}}
