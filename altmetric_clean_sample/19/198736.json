Nevertheless, a single algorithm only, the Branching Index (BI), has been developed for this task so far. Moving along the genome of a query sequence in a sliding window, the BI computes a ratio quantifying how closely the query sequence clusters with a subtype clade. In its current version, however, the BI does not provide predicted boundaries of unknown fragments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Thomas Unterthiner","Thomas Unterthiner","Anne-Kathrin Schultz","Jan Bulla","Burkhard Morgenstern","Mario Stanke","Ingo Bulla"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-12-93","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T13:51:55+00:00","issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1311752400,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/12\/93"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-12-93.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3086866","pmid":"21481263","pubdate":"2011-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"93","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Detection of viral sequence fragments of HIV-1 subfamilies yet unknown","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-viral-sequence-fragments-hiv1-subfamilies-unknown"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.04,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.04},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":602340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3082232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54747,"mean":4.5731048478428,"rank":9771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":44967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54747,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2307,"mean":4.2566947094536,"rank":540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2307,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":3.5784,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
