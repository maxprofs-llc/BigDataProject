Little is known about how heterogeneous permeability develops, or how it varies among individual metastases. Understanding the BBB's role in metastasis will be crucial to the development of new, more effective therapies. In this article, we developed the first magnetic resonance imaging-based strategy to detect and measure the volumes of BBB permeable and nonpermeable metastases and studied the development of altered BBB permeability in metastases in vivo, over time in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to the brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a7a","authors":["Percy DB","Ribot EJ","Chen Y","McFadden C","Simedrea C","Steeg PS","Chambers AF","Foster PJ"],"doi":"10.1097\/rli.0b013e318226c427","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T14:27:21+00:00","issns":["1536-0210","0020-9996"],"issue":"11","journal":"Investigative Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1320387365,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21788908?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/investigativeradiology\/Abstract\/2011\/11000\/In_Vivo_Characterization_of_Changing_Blood_Tumor.8.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21788908"],"pmid":"21788908","pubdate":"2011-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"In Vivo Characterization of Changing Blood-Tumor Barrier Permeability in a Mouse Model of Breast Cancer Metastasis: A Complementary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Approach","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-characterization-changing-bloodtumor-barrier-permeability-mouse-model-breast-cancer-metastasis-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770903,"mean":5.7215656817113,"rank":1831305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2901382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770903,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58569,"mean":5.3309998292583,"rank":19358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":38404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58569,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":838,"mean":1.1682891278375,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":838,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
