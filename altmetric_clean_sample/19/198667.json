High-throughput screening (HTS) in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ToxCast\u2122 project provides vast data on an expanding chemical library currently consisting of > 1,000 unique compounds across > 500 in vitro assays in phase I (complete) and Phase II (under way). This public data set can be used to evaluate concentration-dependent effects on many diverse biological targets and build predictive models of prototypical toxicity pathways that can aid decision making for assessments of human developmental health and disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","doi":"10.1289\/ehp.1103412","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T11:35:16+00:00","issns":["1552-9924"],"journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1311764916,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21788198?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21788198","pubdate":"2011-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Environmental Impact on Vascular Development Predicted by High Throughput Screening.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/environmental-impact-vascular-development-predicted-highthroughput-screening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59703,"mean":5.4235958594352,"rank":51834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59703,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2698,"mean":10.727858361142,"rank":2462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2698,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":10.018541666667,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
