Not according to this #study"],"citation":{"abstract":"A leading notion is that language skill acquisition declines between childhood and adulthood. While several lines of evidence indicate that declarative (\"what\", explicit) memory undergoes maturation, it is commonly assumed that procedural (\"how-to\", implicit) memory, in children, is well established. The language superiority of children has been ascribed to the childhood reliance on implicit learning. Here we show that when 8-year-olds, 12-year-olds and young adults were provided with an equivalent multi-session training experience in producing and judging an artificial morphological rule (AMR), adults were superior to children of both age groups and the 8-year-olds were the poorest learners in all task parameters including in those that were clearly implicit. The AMR consisted of phonological transformations of verbs expressing a semantic distinction: whether the preceding noun was animate or inanimate. No explicit instruction of the AMR was provided. The 8-year-olds, unlike most adults and 12-year-olds, failed to explicitly uncover the semantic aspect of the AMR and subsequently to generalize it accurately to novel items. However, all participants learned to apply the AMR to repeated items and to generalize its phonological patterns to novel items, attaining accurate and fluent production, and exhibiting key characteristics of procedural memory. Nevertheless, adults showed a clear advantage in learning implicit task aspects, and in their long-term retention. Thus, our findings support the notion of age-dependent maturation in the establishment of declarative but also of procedural memory in a complex language task. In line with recent reports of no childhood advantage in non-linguistic skill learning, we propose that under some learning conditions adults can effectively express their language skill acquisition potential. Altogether, the maturational effects in the acquisition of an implicit AMR do not support a simple notion of a language skill learning advantage in children.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010PLoSO...513648F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sara Ferman","Avi Karni"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0013648","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T02:11:30+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1502472124,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0013648","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0013648","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0013648#s3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0013648.pdf","pmid":"21048965","pubdate":"2010-10-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e13648","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"No Childhood Advantage in the Acquisition of Skill in Using an Artificial Language Rule","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/childhood-advantage-acquisition-skill-using-artificial-language-rule"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.988,"score_history":{"1y":24,"6m":24,"3m":24,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.988},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":262712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8092583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73109,"mean":6.1554080264814,"rank":2087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":71022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73109,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115457,"mean":10.618014932096,"rank":6253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":109204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115457,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1610,"mean":9.0552541951523,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1610,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
