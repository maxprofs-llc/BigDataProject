Here, we identify a novel Arabidopsis gene, ORGAN SIZE RELATED1 (OSR1), that is involved in regulation of organ growth and overall organ size. \u2022 A combination of genetic, cytological and molecular approaches was used to characterize the expression profile, subcellular localization and roles of OSR1 during organ growth. \u2022 Ectopic expression of OSR1 in Arabidopsis resulted in enlarged organs, as a consequence of increases in both cell number and cell size. OSR1 shares a conserved OSR domain with ARGOS and ARGOS-LIKE (ARL), which is sufficient for their functions in promoting organ growth. OSR1 is a plant hormone-responsive gene and appears to act redundantly with ARGOS and ARL during organ growth. The OSR proteins are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. \u2022 Our results suggest that three co-evolved members of the OSR family may act coordinately to orchestrate growth signals and cell proliferation and expansion, thereby affecting organ growth and final organ size.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Feng, Guanping","Qin, Zhixiang","Yan, Jingzhou","Zhang, Xiaoran","Hu, Yuxin"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2011.03710.x","endpage":"646","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T16:10:36+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1469-8137","0028-646X"],"issue":"3","journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1311868928,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2011.03710.x\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2011.03710.x\/pdf","pmid":"21457262","pubdate":"2011-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"635","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Arabidopsis ORGAN SIZE RELATED1 regulates organ growth and final organ size in orchestration with ARGOS and ARL","type":"article","volume":"191","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arabidopsis-organ-size-related1-regulates-organ-growth-final-organ-size-orchestration-argos-arl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2126266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2211178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57689,"mean":5.0418359104146,"rank":24356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":31298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57689,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2438,"mean":5.2905703734099,"rank":1711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2438,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.5005,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
