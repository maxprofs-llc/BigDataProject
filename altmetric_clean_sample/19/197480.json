CDK8 is involved in the regulation of mRNA transcription and was identified as a potent oncogene in colon cancerogenesis. We have solved the 2.2-\u00c5 crystal structure of CDK8\/CycC in complex with sorafenib, an anti-cancer drug of clinical relevance. The CDK8 structure reveals a unique CycC recognition helix that explains the specificity of the CDK8\/CycC pair and discrimination among the highly promiscuous binding in the CDK\/cyclin family. In contrast to all CDKs, the CDK8 activation loop appears not to be phosphorylated. Based on the structure, we discuss an alternate mode of CDK8 activation to the general CDK activation by T-loop phosphorylation. Sorafenib binds to the catalytic cleft of CDK8. It displays a deep pocket binding mode and is the first small molecule to induce a DFG-out conformation in the CDK family, which is actually DMG-out in CDK8.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2011.07.020","first_seen_on":"2011-07-26T07:18:07+00:00","issns":["00222836"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1311664034,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022283611007741","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21806996"],"pmid":"21806996","pubdate":"2011-07-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The structure of CDK8\/CycC implicates specificity in the CDK\/Cyclin family and reveals the interaction with a deep pocket binder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-cdk8cycc-implicates-specificity-cdkcyclin-family-reveals-interaction-deep-pocket-binder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5098145,"mean":6.0405697540146,"rank":2693429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1740157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5098145,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60100,"mean":5.4506952528328,"rank":29151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":20114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60100,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3435,"mean":2.9902550960978,"rank":2475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3435,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.7394761904762,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":23,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
