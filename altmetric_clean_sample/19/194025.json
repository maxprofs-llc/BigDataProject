Cannabis impacts the formation and functions of neuronal circuitries by targeting cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoid signaling emerges as a signaling cassette that orchestrates neuronal differentiation programs through the precisely timed interaction of endocannabinoid ligands with their cognate cannabinoid receptors. By indiscriminately prolonging the 'switched-on' period of cannabinoid receptors, cannabis can hijack endocannabinoid signals to evoke molecular rearrangements, leading to the erroneous wiring of neuronal networks. Here, we formulate a hierarchical network design necessary and sufficient to describe the molecular underpinnings of cannabis-induced neural growth defects. We integrate signalosome components, deduced from genome- and proteome-wide arrays and candidate analyses, to propose a mechanistic hypothesis of how cannabis-induced ectopic cannabinoid receptor activity overrides physiological neurodevelopmental endocannabinoid signals, affecting the timely formation of synapses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b4","authors":["Erik Keimpema","Ken Mackie","Tibor Harkany"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tips.2011.05.004","first_seen_on":"2011-07-21T17:42:57+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["01656147"],"journal":"Trends in Pharmacological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1504288020,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/pharmacological-sciences\/abstract\/S0165-6147(11)00092-7","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.tips.2011.05.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21757242","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3159827"],"pmid":"21757242","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Molecular model of cannabis sensitivity in developing neuronal circuits","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-model-cannabis-sensitivity-developing-neuronal-circuits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":8,"3m":8,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":779708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7672533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72577,"mean":6.1960634369489,"rank":7668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":64838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72577,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":849,"mean":7.0957429245283,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":849,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.9414545454545,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
