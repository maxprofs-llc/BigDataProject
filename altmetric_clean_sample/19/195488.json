In this study, we analyzed for the first time the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 in two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines HuH7 and PLC\/PRF\/5 (PLC) in cell culture and in tumor xenograft models. By viral proliferation assays and cell survival tests, we demonstrated that GLV-1h68 efficiently colonized, replicated in, and did lyse these cancer cells in culture. Experiments with HuH7 and PLC xenografts have revealed that a single intravenous injection (i.v.) of mice with GLV-1h68 resulted in a significant reduction of primary tumor sizes compared to uninjected controls. In addition, replication of GLV-1h68 in tumor cells led to strong inflammatory and oncolytic effects resulting in intense infiltration of MHC class II-positive cells like neutrophils, macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells and in up-regulation of 13 pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, GLV-1h68 infection of PLC tumors inhibited the formation of hemorrhagic structures which occur naturally in PLC tumors. Interestingly, we found a strongly reduced vascular density in infected PLC tumors only, but not in the non-hemorrhagic HuH7 tumor model. These data demonstrate that the GLV-1h68 vaccinia virus may have an enormous potential for treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma in man.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0022069","first_seen_on":"2011-07-23T10:44:05+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1311416492,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21779374?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21779374","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Efficient Colonization and Therapy of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Using the Oncolytic Vaccinia Virus Strain GLV-1h68.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-colonization-therapy-human-hepatocellular-carcinoma-hcc-using-oncolytic-vaccinia-virus-str"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":981257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57166,"mean":4.9523912184029,"rank":37858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":11654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57166,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80034,"mean":8.2711350817788,"rank":55593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":17185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80034,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1501,"mean":6.9609493333333,"rank":1045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1501,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
