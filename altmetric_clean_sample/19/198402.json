However, the long-term consequences of repeated influenza vaccination are unknown. We used a simple model of recurrent influenza infection to assess the likely impact of various repeated influenza vaccination scenarios. The model was based on a Markovian framework and was fitted on annual incidence rates of influenza infection by age. We found that natural influenza infection reduced the risk of being re-infected by 15.4% (95% confidence interval 7.1-23.0). Various scenarios of repeated influenza vaccination were then simulated and compared with a reference scenario where vaccination is given from age 65 years onwards. We show that repeated vaccination at a young age substantially increases the risk of influenza in older age, by a factor ranging between 1.2 (vaccination after 50 years) to 2.4 (vaccination from birth). These findings have important implications for influenza vaccination policies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006544","doi":"10.1017\/s0950268805005479","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T04:17:10+00:00","issns":["1469-4409"],"issue":"01","journal":"Epidemiology & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1317895771,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=369945"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0950268805005479","pmid":"16409652","pubdate":"2006-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Repeated influenza vaccination of healthy children and adults: borrow now, pay later?","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/repeated-influenza-vaccination-healthy-children-adults-borrow-now-pay-later"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":1347828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2267959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54599,"mean":4.5503126854463,"rank":14685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":39833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54599,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":751,"mean":3.04868,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":751,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.298,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
