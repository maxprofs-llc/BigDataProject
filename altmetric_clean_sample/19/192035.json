The patients were conditioned with reduced-intensity regimens, and CYA was used for GVHD prophylaxis. Successful engraftment occurred in 16 patients (94%). One patient failed to achieve a primary engraftment. Another patient rejected the first SCT after 10 weeks and had a successful second transplant. Of all engrafted patients, only one developed severe acute GVHD. Ten patients were alive at a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 5-62 months). The 5-years' OS was 53.8%. The three patients with FA are currently well with full-donor chimerism at 16, 6 and 5 months post transplant, respectively. The OS of 14 patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies was 47.6%. Three patients died as a result of post transplant leukemia relapse. CMV infection, GVHD and organ injury were other causes of mortality. Haploidentical SCT was found to be an alternative feasible treatment in Uruguay for patients who need allogenic transplantation but lack an HLA-identical family donor. It should be considered as an early option in FA patients before transformation or significant exposure to blood products.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002414","doi":"10.1038\/bmt.2011.148","first_seen_on":"2011-07-19T15:15:17+00:00","issns":["1476-5365"],"journal":"Bone Marrow Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1311112057,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21765479?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21765479","pubdate":"2011-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Feasibility and outcome of haploidentical SCT in pediatric high-risk hematologic malignancies and Fanconi anemia in Uruguay.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/feasibility-outcome-haploidentical-sct-pediatric-highrisk-hematologic-malignancies-fanconi-anemia-ur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2672558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58607,"mean":5.4274983448793,"rank":28547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":19327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58607,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1058,"mean":4.3856121097446,"rank":652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1058,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.1851851851852,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
