Recombinant Glo-3A was used to enrich anti-Glo-3A immunoglobulin G antibodies from plasma by batch affinity chromatography. Rat jejunum and pancreas, as well as human duodenum and monocytes were probed, and binding was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Glo-3A-enriched antibodies bound to a specific subset of cells in the lamina propria of rat jejunum that co-localized mostly with a marker of resident, alternatively activated CD163-positive (CD163\u207a) macrophages. Blood monocytes and macrophage-like cells in human duodenum were also labelled with the enriched antibodies. Blocking studies revealed that binding to CD163\u207a macrophages was not due to cross-reactivity with anti-Glo-3A antibodies, but rather to non-Glo-3A antibodies co-purified during antibody enrichment. The novel finding of putative autoantibodies against tolerogenic intestinal CD163\u207a macrophages suggests that regulatory macrophages were targeted in this patient with celiac disease and T1D.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006db3","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T14:53:50+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["0835-7900"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1311777928,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21766094"],"pmid":"21766094","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Antibodies from a patient with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease bind to macrophages that express the scavenger receptor CD163.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodies-patient-type-1-diabetes-celiac-disease-bind-macrophages-express-scavenger-receptor-cd163"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":2015686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54583,"mean":4.5706372796893,"rank":23652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":22433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54583,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":2.2510533333333,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":12.493333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
