Currently, fluorescent proteins are used routinely to investigate the behavior of proteins in live cells. Chemical biology techniques for selective labeling of proteins with fluorescent labels have become an attractive alternative to fluorescent protein labeling. In the last ten years the progress in the development of chemical tagging methods have been substantial offering a broad palette of applications for live cell fluorescent microscopy. Several methods for protein labeling have been established, using protein tags, peptide tags and enzyme mediated tagging. This review focuses on the different strategies to achieve the attachment of fluorophores to proteins in live cells and cast light on the advantages and disadvantages of each individual method. Selected experiments in which chemical tags have been successfully applied to live cell imaging will be discussed and evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba3","authors":["Wombacher, Richard","Cornish, Virginia W."],"doi":"10.1002\/jbio.201100018","endpage":"402","first_seen_on":"2011-07-16T14:24:27+00:00","issns":["1864-0648"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Biophotonics","last_mentioned_on":1365046461,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201100018\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201100018\/pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jbio.201100018","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21567974"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jbio.201100018\/pdf","pmid":"21567974","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"391","subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Chemical tags: applications in live cell fluorescence imaging.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-tags-applications-live-cell-fluorescence-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6375759,"mean":5.9877677907471,"rank":1155980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5215464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6375759,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60021,"mean":5.782996167944,"rank":13669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":46239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60021,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":3.2482989473684,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":48,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
