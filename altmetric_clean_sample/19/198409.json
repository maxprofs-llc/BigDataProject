Coinfections and superinfections have been increasingly documented and provide a founding cause for the expansion of viral diversity through recombination. It is still relatively unclear how HIV-1 will propagate and evolve in individuals infected with more than one viral strain. Here we report on the parallel transmission of genetically distant viral strains cocirculating in one individual over many years to a single recipient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006922","authors":["Maaike B. van Werkhoven","Elly Baan","Margreet Bakker","Suzanne Jurriaans","William A Paxton","Georgios Pollakis"],"doi":"10.1089\/aid.2011.0178","first_seen_on":"2011-07-27T04:38:08+00:00","issns":["0889-2229","1931-8405"],"journal":"AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses","last_mentioned_on":1311740020,"links":["http:\/\/www.liebertonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/aid.2011.0178"],"pmid":"21790473","pubdate":"2011-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"110726125340005","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Transmission of Two Distinct HIV Type 1 Strains to an Individual That Were Harbored for Many Years by Another","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transmission-two-distinct-hiv-type-1-strains-individual-were-harbored-years-another"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":2325416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1541635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57689,"mean":4.9785047150187,"rank":26313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":21461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57689,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":2.5472012480499,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":0.93745833333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
