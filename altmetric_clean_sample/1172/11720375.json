All patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy and ILM peeling without staining. Clinical examination at ten years including determination of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), evaluation of quality of life and spectral domain optical coherence tomography was performed.\nFour men and six women with mean age of 64\u00b18\u00a0years were included. The mean diameter of the MH was 395\u00b1133\u03bcm. The mean best corrected visual acuity improved significantly from 0.90\u00b10.22\u00a0logMAR to 0.14\u00b10.14\u00a0logMAR after 10\u00a0years with a satisfactory quality of life in 90\u00a0% of patients. The integrity of the IS\/OS layer was preserved in 9\u00a0eyes. Inner retinal dimples located in the temporal quadrant related to ILM peeling initiation were observed in 8\u00a0eyes. No significant RNFL or ganglion cell complex changes were found compared to the contralateral eye.\nMacular hole surgery with ILM peeling in this series resulted in a visual acuity gain of 8\u00a0ETDRS lines and persistent improvement in quality of life after a 10-year follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b2c","authors":["Foveau, P","Conart, J-B","Hubert, I","Selton, J","Berrod, J-P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jfo.2016.01.011","first_seen_on":"2016-09-04T10:56:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1773-0597"],"journal":"Journal Fran\u00e7ais d'Ophtalmologie","last_mentioned_on":1472986570,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27591131?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pmid":"27591131","pubdate":"2016-09-04T22:01:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"[Anatomical and functional results of macular hole surgery with internal limiting membrane peeling after 10-year follow-up].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/r%C3%A9sultats-anatomiques-et-fonctionnels-la-chirurgie-du-trou-maculaire-avec-pelage-membrane-limitante"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7197977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251851,"mean":12.45802135398,"rank":210697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251851,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308,"mean":0.81671009771987,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.725,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OCTMD\/statuses\/772387777015087104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11720375],"posted_on":"2016-09-04T10:56:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Brandon Lujan, MD","url":"http:\/\/OCTMD.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/459117248297189376\/n_gr2d1r_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical Retina and Imaging Specialist with Expertise in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).","id_on_source":"OCTMD","tweeter_id":"244660420","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1320},"tweet_id":"772387777015087104"}]}}
