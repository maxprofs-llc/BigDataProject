DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases carry both a glycosylase activity that removes the faulty base and an apyrimidinic\/apurinic (AP)-lyase activity that introduces a single-strand DNA incision. In particular, the CUT domains within the CUX1 and CUX2 proteins were recently shown to interact with the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase and stimulate its enzymatic activities. SATB1, which contains two CUT domains, was originally characterized as a T-cell specific genome organizer whose aberrant overexpression in breast cancer can promote tumor progression. Here, we investigated the involvement of SATB1 in DNA repair. SATB1 knockdown caused a delay in DNA repair following exposure to H2O2, an increase in OGG1-sensitive oxidized bases within genomic DNA, and a decrease in 8-oxoG cleavage activity in cell extracts. In parallel, we observed an increase in phospho-CHK1 and \u03b3H2AX levels and a decrease in DNA synthesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of SATB1 accelerated DNA repair and reduced the levels of oxidized bases in genomic DNA. Moreover, an eGFP-SATB1 fusion protein was rapidly recruited to laser microirradiation-induced DNA damage. Using purified proteins, we showed that SATB1 interacts directly with OGG1, increases its binding to 8-oxoG containing DNA, promotes Schiff base formation and stimulates its glycosylase and AP\/lyase enzymatic activities. Structure\/function analysis demonstrated that CUT domains, but not the homeodomain, are responsible for the stimulation of OGG1. Together these results identify another CUT domain protein that functions both as a transcription factor and an accessory factor in base excision repair.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Kaur, Simran","Coulombe, Yan","Ramdzan, Zubaidah M","Leduy, Lam","Masson, Jean-Yves","Nepveu, Alain","Simran Kaur","Yan Coulombe","Zubaidah M.
