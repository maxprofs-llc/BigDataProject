(Solanaceae) has been well known as nightshade, commonly used by diverse populations to heal several disorders. Earlier studies in Solanum trilobatum were focused on different pharmacological activities and a few were concerned with antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects. Thus, the current study was focused to evaluate the antioxidant potential and hepatoprotective effects of S. trilobatum L. on thioacetamide (TAA) intoxication in Wistar albino rats. The rats were kept into four groups and six animals each. Group A was normal control. Group B was the TAA treated control. Groups C and D were pretreated with the aqueous extract from the leaves of S. trilobatum (100 mg, 200 mg\/kg bw p.o.) once daily for 10 consecutive days administration followed by a single dose infusion of TAA (100 mg\/kg s.c.). After 10 days, blood and livers were collected. The biochemical assay was carried out in the GSH (reduced glutathione), TBARS(thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), Na\u207a-K\u207a-ATPase, and antioxidant enzymes viz., SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), GPx (glutathione peroxidase), GST (glutathione-S-transferase), and GR (glutathione reductase) were analyzed in samples of blood and liver. Treatment with S.trilobatum reduced blood and liver TBARS, and Na\u207a K\u207a ATPase activity in TAA (thioacetamide)-induced hepatotoxicity rats. Furthermore, the above antioxidant enzymes were increased in the pretreatment of S.trilobatum in TAA intoxicated rats. Finally, we concluded that S. Trilobatum displayed potent antioxidant properties and alleviate oxidative stress induced hepatotoxic effects and possible engross mechanisms related to free radical scavenging properties.","authors":["Kumar Ganesan","Kumeshini Sukalingam","Baojun Xu"],"doi":"10.3390\/antiox6030068","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T02:13:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2076-3921"],"issue":"3","journal":"Antioxidants","last_mentioned_on":1503493522,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3921\/6\/3\/68"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3921\/6\/3\/68\/pdf","pmid":"28829363","pubdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Solanum trilobatum L.
