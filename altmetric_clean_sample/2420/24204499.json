Understanding the mediators that facilitate teens in improving their healthy lifestyle behaviors may be helpful in halting this crisis.\nThe purpose of this systematic review was to assess published findings regarding mediators of adolescent energy balance behaviors.\nWe followed the Institute of Medicine guidelines for completing a systematic review.\nFourteen analyses from 12 studies were included with mediating variables tested for nutrition, physical activity, and screen time. Mediators were identified for all three behaviors and were primarily on the individual level of the social ecological model.\nCombining findings from this and other reviews of mediators can help guide researchers in choosing mediating factors for specific target behaviors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005bae","authors":["Stephanie Kelly","Janna Stephens","Jacqueline Hoying","Colleen McGovern","Bernadette Mazurek Melnyk","Lisa Militello"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.outlook.2017.07.011","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T05:10:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00296554","1528-3968"],"journal":"Nursing Outlook","last_mentioned_on":1503426963,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28823500?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28823500","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"A systematic review of mediators of physical activity, nutrition, and screen time in adolescents: Implications for future research and clinical practice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-mediators-physical-activity-nutrition-screen-time-adolescents-implications-future"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167254,"mean":12.722119531488,"rank":137088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167254,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":4.2439735099338,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.59,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"A systematic review of mediators of physical activity, nutrition, and screen time in adolescents: Implications for future research and clinical practice.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1500990229961488&id=202426883151169","license":"public","citation_ids":[24204499],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T18:36:03+00:00","summary":"Related Articles\n\nA systematic review of mediators of physical activity, nutrition, and screen time in adolescents: Implications for future research and clinical practice. \n\nNurs Outlook. 2017 Jul 22;: \n\nAuthors: Kelly S, Stephens J, Hoying J, McGovern C,","author":{"name":"Mrs. Video Game","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/202426883151169","facebook_wall_name":"Mrs. Video Game","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/202426883151169\/picture","id_on_source":"202426883151169"}}]}}
