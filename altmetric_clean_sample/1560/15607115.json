The binding ability of ICA-Cu to calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) was examined by fluorescence spectrometry and the viscosity method. The results indicated that, upon the addition of increasing amounts of CT-DNA, the excitation and emission intensity of ICA-Cu decreased obviously and the excitation spectra shifted towards a long wavelength. ICA-Cu could displace ethidium bromide (EB) from the EB-DNA system, making the fluorescence intensity of the EB-DNA system decrease sharply; the quenching constant KSV value was 3.99 \u00d7 10\u2074 M(-1). The emission intensity of the ICA-Cu-DNA system was nearly constant, along with the addition of Na\u207a in a series of concentrations. The fluorescence of the complex could be protected after the complex interacted with DNA. A viscosity measurement further supported the result that the ICA-Cu complex may interact with DNA in an intercalative binding mode. The antioxidant activities of ICA-Cu were evaluated by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, a hydroxyl radical (OH) scavenging assay, and a 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay. The ICA-Cu exhibited the highest inhibitory effects on the ABTS radical (94% inhibition at 60 \u00b5M), followed by OH and DPPH radicals (the degrees of inhibition being 71% and 56%, respectively). The in vitro cytotoxicity activity of ICA-Cu against two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, was investigated by 3-[4,5-dimethyltiazol2-yl]-2.5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cellular morphological analysis. The results showed that, upon increasing the concentration of ICA-Cu, an increase was observed in growth-inhibitory activity and the inhibition percentage were greater than 90% at 20 \u00b5M in both cell lines. Also, cellular morphological changes in the two cell lines agreed with the cytotoxicity results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Xiangcong Wang","Maocai Yan","Qibao Wang","Huannan Wang","Zhengyang Wang","Jiayi Zhao","Jing Li","Zhen Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22010171","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T11:23:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1484911403,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/171?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/171?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/171\/pdf","pmid":"28117677","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"171","subjects":["biology"],"title":"In Vitro DNA-Binding, Anti-Oxidant and Anticancer Activity of Indole-2-Carboxylic Acid Dinuclear Copper(II) Complexes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/22\/1\/171","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-dnabinding-antioxidant-anticancer-activity-indole2carboxylic-acid-dinuclear-copperii-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":4275469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2247023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259451,"mean":12.81664494893,"rank":147423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259451,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3779,"mean":2.1561810481736,"rank":1153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3779,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":1.2777163120567,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
