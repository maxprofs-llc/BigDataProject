When considering the 87 subjects affected by VMR, 62 of them also had IBS (71.26%). In turn, when considering all 92 subjects with IBS, 62 (67.39%) had VMR. We found a significant association among IBS and nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and turbinates, and among VMR and a change in stool consistency and abdominal pain. Among the patients affected by nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), we found a prevalence of NAR with eosinophils (31%) compared with the other cytologic types.\nThis study expanded the knowledge of the link between VMR and IBS, also the correlation between typical VMR symptoms and IBS, and about the correlation between typical IBS symptoms and VMR. For future implications, the diagnosis of NAR indicated the need to check for the presence of IBS, by using the Rome III criteria, and a diagnosis of IBS indicated the need to check for the presence of VMR. More studies are needed to find the pathogenetic mechanisms to explain the clinical correlation between VMR and IBS as seen in the present study.","authors":["Lauriello, Maria","Eibenstein, Alberto","Angelone, Anna Maria","Pasqua, Marina","Tucci, Cinzia","Di Giacomo, Carla","Salerno, Arnaldo","Frieri, Giuseppe","Fusetti, Marco"],"doi":"10.2500\/ar.2016.7.0184","endpage":"255","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T07:16:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2152-6575"],"issue":"4","journal":"Allergy & Rhinology","last_mentioned_on":1485113391,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/ocean\/rhino\/2016\/00000007\/00000004\/art00010"],"pmid":"28683253","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"249","title":"Association between vasomotor rhinitis and irritable bowel syndrome","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/10.2500\/ar.2016.7.0184","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/syndrome-475"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChordateMedical\/statuses\/822341989614125056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15602932],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T07:16:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Chordate Medical","url":"http:\/\/www.chordate.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3476023204\/fca50925343d70c298b7d5409ca52d7b_normal.jpeg","description":"Medical device company within the area of neuromodulation with rhinitis as first indication.","id_on_source":"ChordateMedical","tweeter_id":"1019512898","geo":{"lt":59.5,"ln":18,"country":"SE"},"followers":65},"tweet_id":"822341989614125056"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FredrikH72\/statuses\/822353009342615552","license":"gnip","rt":["ChordateMedical"],"citation_ids":[15602932],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T08:00:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Fredrik Henckel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000328042409\/508f70f06719cfada6f16efa1134465c_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"FredrikH72","tweeter_id":"329820914","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":21},"tweet_id":"822353009342615552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HelenaOssmer\/statuses\/823251347495616514","license":"gnip","rt":["ChordateMedical"],"citation_ids":[15602932],"posted_on":"2017-01-22T19:29:51+00:00","author":{"name":"HO","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"HelenaOssmer","tweeter_id":"1154832427","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"823251347495616514"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Chordate Medical AB","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1344458748948716&id=491366034257996","license":"public","citation_ids":[15602932],"posted_on":"2017-01-20T08:01:30+00:00","summary":"Friday read\nNon-allergic #rhinitis or Vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) represents a global health problem that affects between 10 and 25%\nof the world population.
