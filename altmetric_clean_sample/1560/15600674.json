The majority of studies in the EE group showed to be RCTs (97%), and the RWE group included mainly cohort studies (89%). There were more studies without a control group within RWE compared with the EE group (10% vs 1%). Our results showed that EE are more often assessed using Jadad, NICE or NOS scale by AOTMiT compared with RWE (93% vs 48%). When the best evidence within a given decision-making process is analysed, half of RWE and two-thirds of EE are considered high quality evidence.\nRWE plays an important role in the decision-making processes on public funding of drugs in Poland, contributing to nearly half (45%) of all the evidence considered. There exist such processes in which the proportion of RWE is dominant, with one process showing RWE as the only evidence presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033f2","authors":["Wilk, N","Wierzbicka, N","Skrzekowska-Baran, I","Mo\u0107ko, P","Tomassy, J","Kloc, K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.puhe.2016.12.025","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T03:33:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00333506","1476-5616"],"journal":"Public Health (Elsevier)","last_mentioned_on":1484869500,"links":["http:\/\/www.publichealthjrnl.com\/article\/S0033-3506(16)30446-2\/fulltext?rss=yes"],"pmid":"28359391","pubdate":"2017-04-01T22:09:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Study types and reliability of Real World Evidence compared with experimental evidence used in Polish reimbursement decision-making processes","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-types-reliability-real-world-evidence-compared-experimental-evidence-used-polish-reimbursement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":1527042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6537161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259182,"mean":12.817173342181,"rank":69174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":188134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259182,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1183,"mean":6.1793976311337,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1183,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":7.0878571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Study types and reliability of Real World Evidence compared with experimental evidence used in Polish reimbursement decision-making processes","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/study-types-and-reliability-of-real-world-evidence-compared-with-experimental-evidence-used-in-polish-reimbursement-decision-making-processes\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[15600674],"posted_on":"2017-01-19T23:45:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nRead this article:&nbsp;\nStudy types and reliability of Real World Evidence compared with experimental evidence used in Polish reimbursement decision-making processes\nThe post Study types and reliability of Real World Evidence compared with experi","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
