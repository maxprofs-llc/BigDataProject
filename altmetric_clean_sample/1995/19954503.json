Ternary metal oxides seem to be a viable option, among which perovskites stand out. In this context, transparent and compact LaFeO3 thin film electrodes have been prepared by sol-gel, both undoped and doped with metals (M) such as magnesium or zinc. Pristine electrodes support the development of cathodic photocurrents in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solutions, particularly in the presence of oxygen, with an onset potential as high as 1.4 V vs. RHE. Doping with Mg or Zn leads to an important enhancement of the photocurrent, which peaks for a stoichiometry LaFe0.95M0.05O3 with a six-fold enhancement with respect to the pristine material. Such an improvement is attributed to an increase in both the density and mobility of the majority carriers, although a contribution of surface passivation cannot be excluded.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["D\u00edez\u2010Garc\u00eda, Mar\u00eda Isabel","G\u00f3mez, Roberto"],"doi":"10.1002\/cssc.201700166","first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T11:59:19+00:00","issns":["18645631","1864-564X"],"journal":"ChemSusChem","last_mentioned_on":1494252764,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201700166\/abstract;jsessionid=8D0B10CD7E8252FFAB7CA3DFBB92B60C.f03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cssc.201700166\/pdf","pmid":"28317341","pubdate":"2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Energy","Materials Science","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Metal Doping for Enhancing the Photoelectrochemical Behavior of LaFeO3 Photocathodes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metal-doping-enhance-photoelectrochemical-behavior-lafeo3-photocathodes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":5915491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1966201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237492,"mean":12.42674283236,"rank":154172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":69511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237492,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1787,"mean":2.8364759238522,"rank":782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1787,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":3.8228461538462,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
