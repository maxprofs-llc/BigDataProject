Thus, individual RNAs are tagged by multiple fluorescent probes, making them detectable by fluorescence microscopy. Since large insertions may affect RNA processes including trafficking and localization, here we present a strategy to visualize single RNA transcripts in living cells using molecular beacons (MBs) - fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes - with minimal target engineering. The MBs are composed of 2'-O-methyl RNAs with a fully phosphorothioate-modified loop domain (2Me\/PSLOOP MBs), an architecture that elicits marginal levels of nonspecific signals in cells. We showed that MBs can detect single transcripts containing as few as 8 target repeat sequences with ~90% accuracy. In both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, mRNAs harboring 8 repeats moved faster than those with 32 repeats, suggesting that intracellular activities are less impeded by smaller engineered insertions. We then report the first MB-based imaging of intracellular dynamics and localization of single long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We envision the proposed minimally-engineered, MB-based technology for live-cell single-molecule RNA imaging could facilitate new discoveries in RNA research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Mingming Chen","Zhao Ma","Xiaotian Wu","Shiqi Mao","Yantao Yang","Jie Tan","Christopher J.
