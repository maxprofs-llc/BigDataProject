Variations of oligoclonal bands (OBs) had opposite trends in the two groups. In MS, OBs were detected in 399 of 411 patients (97%) and never disappeared. In NMO, OBs were detected in three of 11 patients (27%) and always disappeared. The hypothesis that NMO and MS follow distinct pathogenetic pathways is supported by our findings, which can be useful for the differentiation of NMO from MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000312e","authors":["R Bergamaschi","S Tonietti","D Franciotta","E Candeloro","E Tavazzi","G Piccolo","A Romani","V Cosi","Bergamaschi, R","Tonietti, S","Franciotta, D","Candeloro, E","Tavazzi, E","Piccolo, G","Romani, A","Cosi, V"],"doi":"10.1191\/1352458504ms988oa","first_seen_on":"2016-02-10T14:32:14+00:00","issns":["1352-4585","1477-0970"],"issue":"1","journal":"Multiple Sclerosis (13524585)","last_mentioned_on":1455099034,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1191\/1352458504ms988oa","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14760945","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14760945"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/msj.sagepub.com\/content\/10\/1\/2.full.pdf","pmid":"14760945","pubdate":"2004-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Oligoclonal bands in Devic\u2019s neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis: differences in repeated cerebrospinal fluid examinations","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oligoclonal-bands-devics-neuromyelitis-optica-multiple-sclerosis-differences-repeated-cerebrospinal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8152765,"mean":6.9045738156959,"rank":2060029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4976465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8152765,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333037,"mean":9.811572166372,"rank":100646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":225043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333037,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1844,"mean":5.8834715138361,"rank":788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1844,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.9551267605634,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
