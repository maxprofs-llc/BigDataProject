(Chenopodium album, Chenopodium hybridum, Chenopodium rubrum and Chenopodium urbicum) species were evaluated. The highest phenolic content was found in herb and seeds of all examined plants. Large amounts of free polyphenols were observed in herb extracts of C. album (3.36\u00a0mg\/g DW), seeds of C. urbicum (3.87\u00a0mg\/g DW) and roots of C. urbicum (1.52\u00a0mg\/g DW). The cytotoxic activities of the extracts were assessed against human lung carcinoma A-549 and ovarian carcinoma TOV-112D and normal human fibroblast cell lines. Our study demonstrated that the extracts from the herb of C. rubrum and C. urbicum had the best antioxidant effect of all the extracts analyzed. Most of the extracts tested exhibited low cytotoxicity. However, the extracts from herb and seeds of C. album and C. hybridum showed the significant antiproliferative effect on the TOV-112 cell line. It can be concluded that antioxidant activity and phenolic composition differ mainly between plant parts and are quite similar between the plants, when the same plant part is analyzed. Thus, the Chenopodium extracts could be used as a readily accessible source of natural antioxidants, and may be used in the pharmaceutical industry and for food supplements production.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f61000888f","authors":["Nowak, Renata","Szewczyk, Katarzyna","Gawlik-Dziki, Urszula","Rzymowska, Jolanta","Komsta, \u0141ukasz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.sjbs.2015.01.017","first_seen_on":"2016-02-10T13:25:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1319-562X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1455102341,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26858534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26858534","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Antioxidative and cytotoxic potential of some Chenopodium L. species growing in Poland.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidative-cytotoxic-potential-some-chenopodium-l-species-growing-poland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":5390260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320520,"mean":9.5629422904723,"rank":222181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":54553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320520,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139,"mean":2.1442753623188,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.86304347826087,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
