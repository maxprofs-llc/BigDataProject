The imaging-based metrics included a broader-set of multiscale variables such as inspiratory airway dimension, expiratory air-trapping and registration-based lung deformation (inspiration vs. expiration). Asthma subgroups derived from a clustering method were associated with subject demography, questionnaire, medication history, and biomarker variables.\nCluster 1 patients were early-onset younger nonsevere asthmatics with reversible airflow obstruction, who showed normal airway structure; Cluster 2 patients were a mix of nonsevere and severe asthmatics with marginal inflammation, who exhibited airway luminal narrowing without wall thickening. Cluster 3 and 4 patients were dominated by severe asthmatics. Cluster 3 patients were obese females with reversible airflow obstruction who exhibited airway wall thickening without airway narrowing. Cluster 4 patients were late-onset older males with persistent airflow obstruction, exhibiting significant air-trapping and reduced regional deformation. Clusters 3 and 4 patients also showed decreased lymphocyte and increased neutrophils, respectively.\nFour image-based clusters were identified and shown to be correlated with clinical characteristics. Such clustering serves to differentiate asthma subgroups which may be used as a basis for the development of new therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Sanghun Choi","Eric A.
