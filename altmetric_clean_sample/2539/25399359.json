Obesity results when energy intake exceeds, energy expenditure. Excess adiposity is a major risk factor in the progress of various metabolic disorders accounting insulin resistance, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovarian disease and several types of cancers. Obesity is characterized by pro-inflammatory condition in which hypertrophied adipose tissue along with immune cells contribute to increase the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Immune cells are the key players in inducing low grade chronic inflammation in obesity and are main factor responsible for pathogenesis of insulin resistance resulting Type 2 diabetes. The current review is aimed to investigate the mechanism of pro-inflammatory responses and insulin resistance involving immune cells and their products in obesity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c9","authors":["Ambreen Asghar","Nadeem Sheikh"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cellimm.2017.03.001","first_seen_on":"2017-09-15T23:40:49+00:00","issns":["00088749"],"journal":"Cellular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1505518836,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28285710"],"pmid":"28285710","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Role of immune cells in obesity induced low grade inflammation and insulin resistance","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-immune-cells-obesity-induced-low-grade-inflammation-insulin-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418954,"mean":7.0848786337124,"rank":7275738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418954,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128551,"mean":11.754701361338,"rank":104462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128551,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":552,"mean":2.1606025408348,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":552,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.86111111111111,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
