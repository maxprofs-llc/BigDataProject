To initiate and maintain the differentiated state, a multitude of gene expression changes occur. Accurate assessment of these differentiation-related gene expression changes requires good quality template, but more specifically, appropriate internal controls for normalization. Two cell line-based models used for in vitro analyses of muscle differentiation incorporate mouse C2C12 and rat H9c2 cells. In this study, we set out to identify the most appropriate controls for mRNA expression normalization during C2C12 and H9c2 differentiation. We assessed the expression profiles of Actb, Gapdh, Hprt, Rps12 and Tbp during C2C12 differentiation and of Gapdh and Rps12 during H9c2 differentiation. Using NormFinder, we validated the stability of the genes individually and of the geometric mean generated from different gene combinations. We verified our results using Myogenin. Our study demonstrates that using the geometric mean of a combination of specific reference genes for normalization provides a platform for more precise test gene expression assessment during myoblast differentiation than using the absolute expression value of an individual gene and reinforces the necessity of reference gene validation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081de","authors":["Twinkle J Masilamani","Julie J Loiselle","Leslie C Sutherland"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12033-013-9712-2","first_seen_on":"2013-10-28T07:39:01+00:00","issns":["1559-0305"],"journal":"Molecular Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1382947979,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24146429\/"],"pmid":"24146429","pubdate":"2013-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Humana Press Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Techniques","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Assessment of Reference Genes for Real-Time Quantitative PCR Gene Expression Normalization During C2C12 and H9c2 Skeletal Muscle Differentiation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-reference-genes-realtime-quantitative-pcr-gene-expression-normalization-during-c2c12-h9c2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":3352690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107856,"mean":7.9281863056884,"rank":67795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":36023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107856,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":1.7422555555556,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.05,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
