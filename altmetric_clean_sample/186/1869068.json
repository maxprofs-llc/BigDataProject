Macro-spatial short-term trends are driven predominantly by prior (lagged) seasonal changes in climate, which regulate the abundance of suitable aquatic larval habitats. Micro-spatial distribution is determined by the location of these habitats, proximity and abundance of available human bloodmeals and prevailing micro-climatic conditions. The challenge of analysing--in a single coherent statistical framework--the lagged and distributed effect of seasonal climate changes simultaneously with the effects of an underlying hierarchy of spatial factors has hitherto not been addressed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","doi":"10.1186\/1756-3305-6-311","first_seen_on":"2013-10-30T03:22:58+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc","niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1423062611,"links":["http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/6\/1\/311\/abstract","http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/6\/1\/311"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.parasitesandvectors.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-3305-6-311.pdf","pmid":"24330615","pubdate":"2013-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"311","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Temporal and micro-spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of Anopheles vectors of malaria along the Kenyan coast","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/temporal-microspatial-heterogeneity-distribution-anopheles-vectors-malaria-along-kenyan-coast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715546,"mean":5.6954923819015,"rank":3158980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1371473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715546,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104592,"mean":8.0331026761386,"rank":65905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":34849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104592,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1337,"mean":2.9468263473054,"rank":809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1337,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":2.3347142857143,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
