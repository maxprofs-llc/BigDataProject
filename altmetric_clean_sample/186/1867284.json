In islets isolated from HF-fZDF rats, there was no significant change in the expression of markers of ER stress compared with age matched, obese, non-diabetic fZDF rats.Conclusions:These results provide evidence that obesity-induced activation of the UPR is an adaptive response for increasing the ER folding capacity to meet the increased demand for insulin. As ER stress is not exacerbated in high-fat-diet-induced diabetes, we suggest that failure of the islet to mount an effective adaptive UPR in response to an additional increase in insulin demand, rather than chronic ER stress, may ultimately lead to \u03b2-cell failure and hence diabetes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc57","authors":["O Omikorede","C Qi","T Gorman","P Chapman","A Yu","D M Smith","T P Herbert","Omikorede O","Qi C","Gorman T","Chapman P","Yu A","Smith DM","Herbert TP"],"doi":"10.1038\/nutd.2013.35","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-10-29T14:51:55+00:00","issns":["false","","2044-4052"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nutrition diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1383058673,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nutd\/journal\/v3\/n10\/full\/nutd201335a.html?WT.ec_id=NUTD-201310"],"pmid":"24145577","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"e93","title":"ER stress in rodent islets of Langerhans is concomitant with obesity and |[beta]|-cell compensation but not with |[beta]|-cell dysfunction and diabetes","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/er-stress-rodent-islets-langerhans-concomitant-obesity-%CE%B2cell-compensation-not-%CE%B2cell-dysfunction-diab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575269,"mean":6.0981511691996,"rank":3126041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1963220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575269,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118515,"mean":7.7971452655384,"rank":58264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":44899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118515,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158,"mean":30.362955414013,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
