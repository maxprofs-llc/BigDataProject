Passive anti-A\u03b2 immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for the therapy of AD, based on the administration of specific anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (aA\u03b2mAbs) to delay A\u03b2 aggregation in the brain. However, the main disadvantage of this approach is the required readministration of the aA\u03b2mAbs at frequent intervals. There are only a few reports describing in vitro study for the immobilization of aA\u03b2mAbs to nanoparticles as potential targeting agents of A\u03b2 aggregates. In this article, we report the immobilization of the aA\u03b2mAb clone BAM10 to near-infrared fluorescent maghemite nanoparticles for the inhibition of A\u03b240 fibrillation kinetics and the specific detection of A\u03b240 fibrils. The BAM10-conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles were well-characterized, including their immunogold labeling and cytotoxic effect on PC-12 (pheochromocytoma cell line). Indeed, these antibody-conjugated nanoparticles significantly inhibit the A\u03b240 fibrillation kinetics compared with the same concentration, or even five times higher, of the free BAM10. This inhibitory effect was confirmed by different assays such as the photo-induced crosslinking of unmodified proteins combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A cell viability assay also confirmed that these antibody-conjugated nanoparticles significantly reduced the A\u03b240-induced cytotoxicity to PC-12 cells. Furthermore, the selective labeling of the A\u03b240 fibrils with the BAM10-conjugated near-infrared fluorescent iron oxide nanoparticles enabled specific detection of A\u03b240 fibrils ex vivo by both magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging. This study highlights the immobilization of the aA\u03b2mAb to dual-modal nanoparticles as a potential approach for aA\u03b2mAb delivery, eliminating the issue of readministration, and contributes to the development of multifunctional agents for diagnosis and therapy of AD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007966","authors":["Shlomo Margel","Hadas Skaat","Enav Corem-Salkmon","Igor Grinberg","David Last","David Goez","Yael Mardor"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijn.s52833","first_seen_on":"2013-10-29T03:40:01+00:00","issns":["1178-2013"],"journal":"International Journal of Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1383021491,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/antibody-conjugated-dual-modal-near-infrared-fluorescent-iron-oxide-na-peer-reviewed-article-IJN"],"pmid":"24194640","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4063","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Antibody-conjugated, dual-modal, near-infrared fluorescent iron oxide nanoparticles for antiamyloidgenic activity and specific detection of amyloid-&beta; fibrils","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/antibody-conjugated-dual-modal-near-infrared-fluorescent-iron-oxide-na-peer-reviewed-article-IJN","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibodyconjugated-dualmodal-nearinfrared-fluorescent-iron-oxide-nanoparticles-antiamyloidgenic-acti-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2302292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1601390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102639,"mean":7.8006251875527,"rank":50548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":37402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102639,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1146,"mean":1.8409082969432,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1146,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":2.8178541666667,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
