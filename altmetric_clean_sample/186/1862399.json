Chronic osteomyelitis represents a major health problem due to its difficult treatment and increased morbidity. Photodynamic antimicrobial therapy (PAmT) is a treatment based on a cytotoxic photochemical reaction in which a bright light produced by a laser system and an active photosensitizer absorbed by cells leads to a process of activation that induces a series of metabolic reactions that culminates a bacterial killing. The aim of the present randomized study was to evaluate, by in vitro and in vivo microbiological analysis, the effects of PAmT on tibial surgical bone defects in rats infected by Staphylococcus aureus using bacterial counts carried out immediately and after 30 days after treatment as outcome measure. In the preliminary in vitro study, a diode laser (\u03bb660 nm; 40 mW; \u03d5\u2009=\u20090.4 cm(2); 5 or 10 J\/cm(2)) and 5, 10, and 15 \u03bcg\/mL toluidine blue were tested, and the best parameter was chosen for the in vivo study. The concentration of 5 \u03bcg\/mL was selected to perform the decontamination of S. aureus-infected tibial bone defects in rats. The findings were subjected to statistical analysis. For all PAmTs groups, with the different concentrations, treatment showed significant reductions (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the amount of bacteria. The in vivo study PAmT group presented a bacterial reduction of 97.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The PAmT using toluidine blue was effective in reducing the number of S. aureus in both in vitro and in vivo studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fe2","authors":["Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Alves dos Reis Junior","Fab\u00c3\u00adola Bastos de Carvalho","Renan Ferreira Trindade","Patr\u00c3\u00adcia Nascimento de Assis","Paulo Fernando de Almeida","Ant\u00c3\u00b4nio Luiz Barbosa Pinheiro","Jo\u00e3o Alves dos Reis Junior","Fab\u00edola Bastos de Carvalho","Patr\u00edcia Nascimento de Assis","Ant\u00f4nio Luiz Barbosa Pinheiro"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10103-013-1422-2","first_seen_on":"2013-10-27T12:52:41+00:00","issns":["1435-604X","0268-8921"],"journal":"Lasers in Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1382874359,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10103-013-1422-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10103-013-1422-2.pdf","pmid":"23979801","pubdate":"2013-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer London","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laser Technology, Photonics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Optics, Optoelectronics, Plasmonics and Optical Devices","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quantum Optics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","biotechnology"],"title":"A new preclinical approach for treating chronic osteomyelitis induced by Staphylococcus aureus: in vitro and in vivo study on photodynamic antimicrobial therapy (PAmT)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-preclinical-approach-treating-chronic-osteomyelitis-induced-staphylococcus-aureus-vitro-vivo-stu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229233,"mean":5.9658211095702,"rank":2926419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229233,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114049,"mean":7.9157026164423,"rank":56333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":42883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114049,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":493,"mean":1.3358536585366,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":493,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.4725,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
