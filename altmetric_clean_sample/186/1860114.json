Method: A qualitative research study was conducted in a long term care facility and included a purposeful sample of 16 subjects (6 residents, 6 health care providers, and 4 family members). Field observations, interviews, video-recordings of assisted transfers, and video-elicitation sessions were conducted with the participants. The interviews and video-elicitation sessions were digitally recorded, transcribed and coded independently by at least 2 analysts. The codes were organized under themes. Results: Six themes related to risks and reduction of transfer-related falls were identified - environment, behaviors, health conditions, specific activities, knowledge and awareness, and balancing values. Conclusions: We were able to implement the novel participatory video-elicitation method developed and it was useful to identify risks and risk reduction strategies. Therefore, video-elicitation may be used in future studies to inform the design and testing of interventions to reduce transfer-related falls among LTC residents. Implications for Rehabilitation Falls are common among long term care residents. Visual-elicitation is a useful tool to be used in rehabilitation to assess risks and possible measures to reduce falls. The video-elicitation sessions optimized the ability and engaged residents, health care providers, and family members on providing information and discussing risks and potential measures to reduce transfer-related falls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003b92","authors":["Edgar Ramos Vieira","Hannah M.
