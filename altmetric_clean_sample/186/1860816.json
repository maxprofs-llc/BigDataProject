Isolates were resistant to \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides, demonstrated MICs \u22641 \u00b5g\/mL of colistin and polymyxin, and yielded positive metallo-\u03b2-lactamase screening results. Eight isolates had blaNDM-1, and 1 isolate had a novel allele (blaNDM-6). All 8 patients had recently been in India or Pakistan, where 6 received inpatient health care. Plasmids carrying blaNDM frequently carried AmpC or extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase genes. Two K. pneumoniae isolates and a K. pneumoniae isolate from Sweden shared incompatibility group A\/C plasmids with indistinguishable restriction patterns and a common blaNDM fragment; all 3 were multilocus sequence type 14. Restriction profiles of the remaining New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase plasmids, including 2 from the same patient, were diverse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027bd","authors":["J Kamile Rasheed","Brandon Kitchel","Wenming Zhu","Karen F Anderson","Nancye C Clark","Mary Jane Ferraro","Patrice Savard","Romney M Humphries","Alexander J Kallen","Brandi M Limbago","Rasheed JK","Kitchel B","Zhu W","Anderson KF","Clark NC","Ferraro MJ","Savard P","Humphries RM","Kallen AJ","Limbago BM","J.
