The parasporin, encoded by a gene 2,169 bp long, was a polypeptide of 723 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 81, 045. The sequence of parasporin contained the five conserved blocks commonly found in B. thuringiensis Cry proteins; however, only very low homologies (<25%) between parasporin and the existing classes of Cry and Cyt proteins were detected. Parasporin exhibited cytocidal activity only when degraded by proteases into smaller molecules of 40 to 60 kDa. Trypsin and proteinase K activated parasporin, while chymotrypsin did not. The activated parasporin showed strong cytocidal activity against human leukemic T cells (MOLT-4) and human uterus cervix cancer cells (HeLa) but not against normal T cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf2","authors":["Eiichi Mizuki","Yu Shin Park","Hiroyuki Saitoh","Satoko Yamashita","Tetsuyuki Akao","Kazuhiko Higuchi","Michio Ohba"],"first_seen_on":"2013-10-26T01:27:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1556-679X","1071-412X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1382750820,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC95925\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/CDLI.7.4.625-634.2000","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10882663","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC95925"],"pmcid":"PMC95925","pmid":"10882663","pubdate":"2000-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","startpage":"625","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Parasporin, a Human Leukemic Cell-Recognizing Parasporal Protein of Bacillus thuringiensis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parasporin-human-leukemic-cellrecognizing-parasporal-protein-bacillus-thuringiensis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":771521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2831690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95699,"mean":7.7597230036157,"rank":25418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95699,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.49718,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
