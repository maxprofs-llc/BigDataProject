Food intake and accelerometry measurements were collected daily for 17 days in 15 young women. Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) using doubly labeled water was also measured. The daily deviations in macronutrient and energy intake and energy expenditure from the average values were compared with the deviations observed over succeeding intervals to estimate the corrective responses. The intraindividual coefficients of variation for energy intake averaged \u00b125%, ranging from 16% to 34%. TDEE had a coefficient of variation of 8.3%, and accelerometry had a coefficient of variation of 8.4% (range=4.6% to 16.4%). Energy expenditure by accelerometry (2,087\u00b1191 kcal\/day) was not significantly different from TDEE (2,128\u00b1177 kcal\/day), but reported daily energy intake was 20.4% lower (1,693\u00b1276 kcal\/day). There were significant corrective responses in energy from fat and total energy intake. This occurred from Days 3 to 6, with a peak at Day 5 that disappeared when data were randomized within each subject. Human beings show corrective responses to deviations from average energy and macronutrient intakes with a lag time of 3 to 6 days, but not 1 to 2 days. These corrective responses are likely to play a role in bringing about weight stability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8b","authors":["Champagne, Catherine M.","Han, Hongmei","Bajpeyi, Sudip","Rood, Jennifer","Johnson, William D.","Lammi-Keefe, Carol J.","Flatt, Jean-Pierre","Bray, George A."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jand.2013.07.001","first_seen_on":"2013-10-29T14:21:10+00:00","issns":["2212-2672"],"journal":"Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","last_mentioned_on":1383959557,"links":["http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S2212-2672(13)01119-2\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=2212-2672_201311_113_11&elsca4=nutrition_dietetics","http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S2212-2672(13)01119-2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.andjrnl.org\/article\/S2212-2672(13)01119-2\/pdf","pmid":"24021734","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Day-to-Day Variation in Food Intake and Energy Expenditure in Healthy Women: The Dietitian II Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/daytoday-variation-food-intake-energy-expenditure-healthy-women-dietitian-ii-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1873095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3145627,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108278,"mean":7.9129629745932,"rank":33577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":74226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108278,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":15.256202852615,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":22.661733333333,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
