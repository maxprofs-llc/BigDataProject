This study examines the ability of different types of nutrition labelling schemes (multiple traffic light label, nutrition table, GDA, logo) to communicate product healthfulness (a) across different product categories, (b) between options from the same product category, and (c) when viewed in isolation and in comparison with another product. Results of two experiments in Germany and The Netherlands show that a labelling scheme with reference point information at the nutrient level (e.g., the traffic light label) can achieve all three objectives. Although other types of labelling schemes are also capable of communicating healthfulness, labelling schemes lacking reference point information (e.g., nutrition tables) are less effective when no comparison product is available, and labelling schemes based on overall product healthfulness within the category (e.g., logos) can diminish consumers' ability to differentiate between categories, leading to a potential misinterpretation of product healthfulness. None of the labels affected food preferences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c3","authors":["Erica van Herpen","Sophie Hieke","Hans C.M. van Trijp"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.appet.2013.10.012","first_seen_on":"2013-10-30T09:43:43+00:00","issns":["01956663"],"journal":"Appetite","last_mentioned_on":1394142680,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195666313004224"],"pmid":"24512897","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Inferring Product Healthfulness from Nutrition Labelling: The Influence of Reference Points","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inferring-product-healthfulness-nutrition-labelling-influence-reference-points"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6699098,"mean":6.1594415963803,"rank":853236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5843919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6699098,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139626,"mean":6.8974962936439,"rank":18926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":120654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139626,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":14.939562067128,"rank":671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":1207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":18.16047826087,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
