CASPT2-based geometries agree reasonably well with M\u00f8ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2), local second-order approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles (LCC2), and density functional theory (DFT) geometries, while the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method exaggerates dramatically the bond length pattern in the polyene chain. The quality of the resulting vertical excitation energies obtained by employing CASSCF, second-order approximate coupled cluster singles and doubles (CC2), LCC2, and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approaches is assessed with respect to the CASPT2 data. We show that the commonly used CASSCF\/CASPT2 approach works reasonably well in the case of vertical excitation energies of planar structures, but lack of dynamic correlation leads to large errors in energetics for strongly strained structures. For example, the highly twisted conformers of 9,10-dimethyl and 9,10,13-trimethyl species are found as global minima at the CASSCF level, whereas they turn almost planar at the CASPT2, MP2, LCC2, and DFT levels of theory. The CC2 method has shown a remarkable performance, manifested by a maximum deviation of 0.05 eV from the reference CASPT2 results, whereas the local version of CC2 seems to fail to describe the charge-transfer character of the S0 \u2192 S1 transitions correctly. We believe that our CASPT2 benchmark set will provide a reference that can be utilized for validation and development studies on 11-cis-retinal protonated Schiff base chromophore analogues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bcd","authors":["El\u017cbieta Walczak","Borys Szefczyk","Tadeusz Andruni\u00f3w"],"doi":"10.1021\/ct400423u","first_seen_on":"2013-10-29T20:25:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-9618","1549-9626"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","last_mentioned_on":1383078311,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ct400423u"],"pmid":"26583410","pubdate":"2013-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"131029102335001","title":"Geometries and Vertical Excitation Energies in Retinal Analogues Resolved at the CASPT2 Level of Theory: Critical Assessment of the Performance of CASSCF, CC2, and DFT Methods","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geometries-vertical-excitation-energies-retinal-analogues-resolved-caspt2-level-theory-critical-asse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":3488696,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":135949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102635,"mean":7.7661440653196,"rank":80477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102635,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2251,"mean":1.3502933333333,"rank":1549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2251,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":0.96241666666667,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
