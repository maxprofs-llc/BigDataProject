Alagille syndrome shares multiple phenotypic variants of other congenital or chronic childhood illnesses such as DiGeorge syndrome, Down syndrome, spina bifida, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis. All of these chronic illnesses have well-established links to psychiatric conditions. There are few community resources for Alagille patients, as it is an extremely rare condition. Despite the overlap with other chronic childhood illnesses, the psychiatric manifestations of Alagille syndrome have not been previously discussed in literature. The current study is a case report of a twelve-year-old female hospitalized in our pediatric psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideation with intent and plan. The patient had major depressive disorder, anxiety, other specified feeding and eating disorder, and attention-deficit\/hyperactive disorder.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef682a83ee09648b4fa4","authors":["Bresnahan, James J."],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/1657691","first_seen_on":"2016-11-27T10:45:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-682X"],"journal":"Case Reports in Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1480270673,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/crips\/2016\/1657691\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/crips\/2016\/1657691.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5149642","pmid":"28018696","pubdate":"2016-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Alagille Syndrome: A Case Report Highlighting Dysmorphic Facies, Chronic Illness, and Depression","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alagille-syndrome-case-report-highlighting-dysmorphic-facies-chronic-illness-depression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7811999,"mean":6.6309711159621,"rank":3800614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3950673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7811999,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250391,"mean":12.189823028076,"rank":124161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":123423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250391,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186,"mean":2.9745297297297,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":7.685,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
