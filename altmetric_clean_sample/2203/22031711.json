Africa"],"citation":{"abstract":"Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax is a major pathogen of livestock in Africa and South America (SA), and genetic studies limited to small sampling suggest greater diversity in East Africa (EA) compared to both West Africa (WA) and SA.\nMultidimensional scaling and phylogenetic analyses of 112 sequences of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene and 263 sequences of the internal transcribed spacer of rDNA (ITS rDNA) were performed to compare trypanosomes from tsetse flies from Gorongosa National Park and Niassa National Reserve of Mozambique (MZ), wild ungulates and livestock from EA, and livestock isolates from WA and SA.\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) supported Tvv (T. vivax) and TvL (T. vivax-like) evolutionary lineages: 1) Tvv comprises two main groups, TvvA\/B (all SA and WA isolates plus some isolates from EA) and TvvC\/D (exclusively from EA). The network revealed five ITS-genotypes within Tvv: Tvv1 (WA\/EA isolates), Tvv2 (SA) and Tvv3-5 (EA). EA genotypes of Tvv ranged from highly related to largely different from WA\/SA genotypes. 2) TvL comprises two gGAPDH-groups formed exclusively by EA sequences, TvLA (Tanzania\/Kenya) and TvLB-D (MZ). This lineage contains more than 11 ITS-genotypes, seven forming the lineage TvL-Gorongosa that diverged from T. vivax Y486 enough to be identified as another species of the subgenus Duttonella. While gGAPDH sequences were fundamental for classification at the subgenus, major evolutionary lineages and species levels, ITS rDNA sequences permitted identification of known and novel genotypes.\nOur results corroborate a remarkable diversity of Duttonella trypanosomes in EA, especially in wildlife conservation areas, compared to the moderate diversity in WA. Surveys in wilderness areas in WA may reveal greater diversity. Biogeographical and phylogenetic data point to EA as the place of origin, diversification and spread of Duttonella trypanosomes across Africa, providing relevant insights towards the understanding of T. vivax evolutionary history.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000883","authors":["Carla MF Rodrigues","Herakles A Garcia","Adriana C Rodrigues","Andr\u00e9 G Costa-Martins","Carlos L Pereira","Dagmar L Pereira","Zakaria Bengaly","Luis Neves","Erney P Camargo","Patrick B Hamilton","Marta MG Teixeira"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13071-017-2241-2","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T21:58:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1756-3305"],"issue":"1","journal":"Parasites & Vectors","last_mentioned_on":1501383845,"links":["https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2241-2?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2241-2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13071-017-2241-2?site=parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28716154","pubdate":"2017-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"337","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"New insights from Gorongosa National Park and Niassa National Reserve of Mozambique increasing the genetic diversity of Trypanosoma vivax and Trypanosoma vivax-like in tsetse flies, wild ungulates and livestock from East Africa","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-insights-gorongosa-national-park-niassa-national-reserve-mozambique-increasing-genetic-diversity-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":3.95,"6m":3.95,"3m":3.95,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":1881127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6405639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188170,"mean":12.049516859844,"rank":53037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":134653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188170,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2301,"mean":3.7306426086957,"rank":422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2301,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":5.4831650485437,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
