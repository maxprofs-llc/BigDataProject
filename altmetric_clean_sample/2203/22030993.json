Here, we describe methods for the proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. Extraction protocols are provided for isolation of soluble, plasma membrane, and tonoplast proteins. In addition, basic analysis and quality metrics for MS\/MS data are discussed. The protocols outlined have the potential to unlock new avenues of research that are not possible through basic genetics or transcriptomic approaches. By combining proteomic information with known gene regulatory patterns, researchers can gain a complete picture of how molecular pathways, such as those required for gravitropism, are initiated, regulated, and terminated.","aggregated_in":[22039751],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Proma Basu","Darron R.
