In these cases, the gas jet perforates the skin leaving an entrance wound similar to that from a conventional gun. In order to investigate the wound morphology in contact shots from blank firearms, test shots were fired at composite models of pig skin and gelatin blocks using three different calibre 9-mm blank cartridge handguns (two pistols and one revolver) and two types of ammunition. It turned out that the penetrating gas jet produced roundish skin defects resembling bullet entrance holes. Small skin particles from the perforation site were dispersed in the underlying simulant where radiating cracks containing greyish gunshot residues indicated the original expansion of the inrushing combustion gases. Apart from the size of the permanent entrance hole in the skin and the final position of the displaced tissue particles, the penetration depth of the gas jet was determined. Under the specified conditions of the test shots, the zone of mechanical destruction within the simulant was 2.2 to 6.1\u00a0cm in length, which illustrates the injuring potential of contact shots inflicted with blank cartridge handguns.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b69","authors":["Rebecca Pircher","Markus Gro\u00dfe Perdekamp","Annette Thierauf-Emberger","Lena Kramer","Stefan Pollak","Dorothee Geisenberger"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00414-017-1650-2","first_seen_on":"2017-07-17T23:20:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0937-9827","1437-1596"],"journal":"International Journal of Legal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1500333632,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00414-017-1650-2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00414-017-1650-2.pdf","pmid":"28717964","pubdate":"2017-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Wound morphology in contact shots from blank cartridge handguns: a study on composite models","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wound-morphology-contact-shots-blank-cartridge-handguns-study-composite-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223669,"mean":6.9683210333815,"rank":4373701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2283264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223669,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159357,"mean":11.812199201787,"rank":87539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":56104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159357,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":595,"mean":3.1702727272727,"rank":299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":595,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.3639534883721,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ForensicResrch\/statuses\/887089665660080129","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22037518],"posted_on":"2017-07-17T23:20:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Forensic Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/696349157078990851\/togmuXzm_normal.jpg","description":"Stay up-to-date with the latest publications in the field of Forensics \/\/ Feed from several scientific journals and websites","id_on_source":"ForensicResrch","tweeter_id":"4884945395","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":80},"tweet_id":"887089665660080129"}]}}
