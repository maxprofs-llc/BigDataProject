In conjunction with these biotechnologies, sexed-sorted semen has been used to obtain offspring of a predetermined sex. This study compared the pregnancy rates obtained using in\u00a0vitro fertilization\/timed embryo transfer (IVF\/TET) and timed artificial insemination (TAI), both performed using sexed-sorted (Y-chromosome-bearing) semen obtained from the same bull. For the in\u00a0vitro embryo production, the ovaries of 250 Nelore cows with known histories were collected in the slaughterhouse and used for IVF. After evaluation of the recipients (IVF\/TET group; n\u00a0=\u00a0974), the resultant embryos were transferred to the females with corpus luteum (n\u00a0=\u00a0822). The pregnancy-related data for this group were compared with those for the TAI group (n\u00a0=\u00a0974). Ultrasonography was performed at 60\u00a0days to determine the pregnancy status and confirm the sex of the fetus. A\u00a0total of 2008 oocytes produced 1050 embryos, with 52% of them reaching the blastocyst stage. The pregnancy rate and the accuracy in determining the fetal sex were 35.4% (345\/974) and 95.07% (328\/345), respectively, for the IVF\/TET group and 30% (293\/974; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 94.88% (278\/293), respectively, for the TAI group. In the present study, we concluded that male calves could be better obtained using IVF\/TET rather than TAI; therefore, this strategy can be considered to increase the pregnancy rate of beef cattle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376c","authors":["Pellegrino, C A G","Morotti, F","Untura, R M","Pontes, J H F","Pellegrino, M F O","Campolina, J P","Seneda, M M","Barbosa, F A","Henry, M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.theriogenology.2016.03.010","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T11:45:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3231","0093691X"],"journal":"Theriogenology","last_mentioned_on":1460634306,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27068357?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27068357","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Use of sexed sorted semen for fixed-time artificial insemination or fixed-time embryo transfer of in\u00a0vitro\u2013produced embryos in cattle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexed-sorted-semen-fixedtime-artificial-insemination-fixedtime-embryo-transfer-invitroproduced-embry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":5715499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1010799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269823,"mean":11.37181220953,"rank":189478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269823,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":957,"mean":2.105359832636,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":957,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":0.93605633802817,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
