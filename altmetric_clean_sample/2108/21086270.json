The patients included were 12\u00a0men and seven women, age range 23-65 years; mean age 57 years. The diagnosis was established with Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection in bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, or biopsy. HRCT images were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a consensus decision. The HRCT findings were classified as (1) miliary nodules; (2) cavitation and centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules; (3) ground-glass attenuation and consolidation; and (4) mediastinal lymph node enlargement.\nThe time between the transplantation and the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis ranged from 7 to 153 days with an average of 79 days. The main HRCT pattern was cavitation and centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules (79%) followed by mediastinal lymph node enlargement (10.4%), ground-glass attenuation or consolidation (5.2%) and miliary nodules (5.2%). None of the patients presented pleural effusion. The cavitation and centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules pattern had upper lobe predominance, and ground-glass attenuation and consolidation pattern had middle lobe\/lingular segment predominance.\nThe main HRCT pattern of pulmonary tuberculosis in liver transplant patients was cavitation and centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002577","authors":["R.
