Iterative algorithms permit subsequent calculation of a surface autocorrelation function with additional numerical approximation of the power spectrum and then yield final reconstruction of the surface shape. The proposed method enables filtering out unwanted scattering background, precluding the convergence of phase-retrieval algorithms. The estimation of higher harmonics in the power spectrum provides the reconstruction of a realistic surface achieving subwavelength resolution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5773cf058f610004d26","authors":["Lysenko, Sergiy","Sterligov, Valeriy","Gon\u00e7alves, Manuel","R\u00faa, Armando","Gritsayenko, Iaroslav","Fern\u00e1ndez, F\u00e9lix"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-15T15:08:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1539-4794"],"issue":"12","journal":"Optics Letters","last_mentioned_on":1497539290,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28614327?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28614327","pubdate":"2017-06-15T22:01:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Quantum Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Super-resolution in diffractive imaging from hemispherical elastic light scattering data.","type":"article","volume":"42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":7237698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241605,"mean":12.662949785599,"rank":197418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241605,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1142,"mean":7.0270674846626,"rank":876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1142,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":11.456666666667,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SRMicro_papers\/statuses\/875369348776550400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21087400],"posted_on":"2017-06-15T15:08:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Super Res Microscopy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/789566896286728192\/otGAZOp0_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot for anything related to super resolution microscopy","id_on_source":"SRMicro_papers","tweeter_id":"2372788392","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":506},"tweet_id":"875369348776550400"}]}}
