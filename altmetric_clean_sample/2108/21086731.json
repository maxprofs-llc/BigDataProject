The present study conducted antennal transcriptome analysis of olfactory genes using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis (RT-qPCR). We identified a total of 104 candidate chemosensory genes from several gene families, including 35 olfactory receptors (ORs), 41 odorant-binding proteins, 20 chemosensory proteins, 6 ionotropic receptors, and 2 sensory neuron membrane proteins. Seven candidate pheromone receptors (PRs) and 3 candidate pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) for sex pheromone recognition were found. OemaOR29 and OemaPBP1 had the highest fragments per kb per million fragments (FPKM) values in all ORs and OBPs, respectively. Eighteen olfactory genes were upregulated in females, including 5 candidate PRs, and 20 olfactory genes were upregulated in males, including 2 candidate PRs (OemaOR29 and 4) and 2 PBPs (OemaPBP1 and 3). These genes may have roles in mediating sex-specific behaviors. Most candidate olfactory genes of sex pheromone recognition (except OemaOR29 and OemaPBP3) in O. emarginata were not clustered with those of studied noctuid species (type I pheromone). In addition, OemaOR29 was belonged to cluster PRIII, which comprise proteins that recognize type II pheromones instead of type I pheromones. The structure and function of olfactory genes that encode sex pheromones in O. emarginata might thus differ from those of other studied noctuids. The findings of the present study may help explain the molecular mechanism underlying olfaction and the evolution of olfactory genes encoding sex pheromones in O. emarginata.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Feng, Bo","Guo, Qianshuang","Zheng, Kaidi","Qin, Yuanxia","Du, Yongjun","Bo Feng","Qianshuang Guo","Kaidi Zheng","Yuanxia Qin","Yongjun Du"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0179433","first_seen_on":"2017-06-15T14:42:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1497912008,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28614384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28614384","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0179433&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0179433&type=printable","pmid":"28614384","pubdate":"2017-06-15T22:01:34+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science (PLoS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Antennal transcriptome analysis of the piercing moth Oraesia emarginata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antennal-transcriptome-analysis-piercing-moth-oraesia-emarginata-lepidoptera-noctuidae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":3864887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4443270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242416,"mean":12.700240372914,"rank":107341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":131095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242416,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115774,"mean":10.637660438963,"rank":52879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":60228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115774,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3783,"mean":10.45779693284,"rank":1600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3783,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lepido_papers\/statuses\/875362791623860226","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21086731],"posted_on":"2017-06-15T14:42:07+00:00","author":{"name":"lepidopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558930683972685824\/x5EhqwSQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for papers on Lepidoptera from PubMed.
