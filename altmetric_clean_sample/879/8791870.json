However, HPV is also a major cause of non-cervical anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers and the potential benefit of vaccination likely extends beyond cervical cancer.\nA systematic literature search of PubMed (1995-2014) identified publications assessing the incidence, persistence, and clearance of non-cervical anogenital\/oral HPV infections. Comparability with cervical HPV was assessed by identifying articles assessing the same or similar populations.\nAvailable data suggest high incidence rates of non-cervical HPV infection in men and women, with HPV-16 predominating in all sites. The incidence of high risk HPV per 100 person-years ranged from 11.4 to 72.9 for penile infections, 6.7-47.9 at other male genital sites, and 4.4-36.7 and 5.3-23.4 for anal infections in men and women, respectively. The incidence per 100 person-years of oral infection with any HPV type ranged from 5.7 to 6.7 in men and 6.8-39.6 in women. Within the limitations of the data, there was a general pattern of higher incidence and clearance of non-cervical genital HPV infections, compared to cervical infections. HIV status, circumcision, number of sex partners and partner HPV status significantly influenced high-risk HPV incidence\/clearance at male anogenital sites. Few studies assessed risk factors for oral HPV.\nParallels appear to exist between the epidemiology of cervical and non-cervical HPV infections in terms of incidence, HPV-type distribution, and risk factors for infection. Available data suggest that non-cervical genital HPV infections may occur more frequently, with higher clearance rates, than cervical infections. More extensive studies could provide useful information for estimating vaccine impact, the wider cost-benefit of HPV vaccination, and guiding vaccination policy.\nNot applicable, as systematic review of the literature.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Sylvia Taylor","Eveline Bunge","Marina Bakker","Xavier Castellsagu\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12879-016-1633-9","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T13:59:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2334"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1477505850,"links":["http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1633-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4908763\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12879-016-1633-9?site=http:\/\/bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4908763","pmid":"27301867","pubdate":"2016-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"The incidence, clearance and persistence of non-cervical human papillomavirus infections: a systematic review of the literature","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-clearance-persistence-noncervical-human-papillomavirus-infections-systematic-review-litera-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421960,"mean":7.0860234078473,"rank":2046794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6364870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421960,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248824,"mean":12.069418044152,"rank":75450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":172861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248824,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3751,"mean":3.9680325333333,"rank":910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3751,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.824736196319,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
