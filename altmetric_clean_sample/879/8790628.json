The study also considered education by CSLA and age by CSLA interactions, as well as the effect of CSLA patterns.\nCSLA frequency was found to be positively related to subsequent cognitive functioning on all measures, 2 years later. The effect of CSLA on memory and fluency was stronger among those with lower education, whereas the age by CSLA interaction was not significant. Respondents who started CSLA after baseline showed better cognitive functioning at Time 2 than those who did not engage in CSLA at all and those who had engaged in such activity at baseline but stopped.\nThe study documents that CSLAs constitute a potential source for the delay or reduction of cognitive decline, regardless of one's age. As such, practitioners should recognize the value of this medium and encourage its greater use in appropriate settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000296d","authors":["Howard Litwin","Ella Schwartz","Noam Damri","Litwin, Howard","Schwartz, Ella","Damri, Noam"],"doi":"10.1093\/geront\/gnw084","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T13:19:45+00:00","issns":["1758-5341","0016-9013"],"journal":"Gerontologist","last_mentioned_on":1505845167,"links":["http:\/\/gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/26\/geront.gnw084.abstract?utm_content=buffer5f81a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/gerontologist\/article\/57\/5\/940\/2632148\/Cognitively-Stimulating-Leisure-Activity-and?rss=1","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/gerontologist\/article-abstract\/57\/5\/940\/2632148\/Cognitively-Stimulating-Leisure-Activity-and#.WcFfoO__V_4.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/04\/26\/geront.gnw084.full.pdf","pmid":"27117305","pubdate":"2016-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"gnw084","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Cognitively Stimulating Leisure Activity and Subsequent Cognitive Function: A SHARE-based Analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitively-stimulating-leisure-activity-subsequent-cognitive-function-sharebased-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.58,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":8.08,"3m":8.08,"1m":8.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8436356,"mean":7.0937825748122,"rank":1060849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7373613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8436356,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248923,"mean":12.068877094029,"rank":43543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":205138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248923,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1442,"mean":7.8778098542679,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1442,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":7.7636363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
