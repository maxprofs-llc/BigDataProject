Triptans are generally underutilized, despite being the gold standard abortive medication for migraine attacks. On the other hand, opioid analgesics are overused as a treatment for headache. One reason for this could be physician unfamiliarity with drug interactions between opioids and other medications, especially the possibility of serotonin toxicity. The general awareness of potential serotonin toxicity with using opioid analgesics is low. In this review, we will conduct a theoretic and evidence-based review of the potential for developing serotonin syndrome in patients who are using opioids analgesics, especially in combination with antidepressants, a common co-prescribed combination. We also review the current diagnostic criteria for serotonin syndrome and identify possible shortcomings of those criteria. Our aim is to increase the awareness of health care providers about potential drug interaction of opioid analgesics with other classes of medication. We place particular emphasis on tramadol since this drug is one of the most commonly used opioid analgesics for headache. The potential for developing serotonin syndrome is relatively high in the patients who are using opioid for pain control. The use of opioids in migraine headache is already discouraged due to the high risk of medication overuse headache and also an increase in headache-related disability (Katsarava et al. Neurology 62:788-790, 2004; Bigal and Lipton. Neurology 71:1821-8, 2008; Casucci and Cevoli. Neurol Sci. 34 Suppl 1:S125-8, 2013). This is another reason that physicians and health care providers should avoid using this class of medication for pain, specifically headache and migraine treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000707b","authors":["Hossein Ansari","Leila Kouti","Ansari, Hossein","Kouti, Leila"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11916-016-0579-3","first_seen_on":"2016-08-01T08:28:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-3081","1531-3433"],"issue":"8","journal":"Current Pain and Headache Reports","last_mentioned_on":1475746925,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11916-016-0579-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27457368\/","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11916-016-0579-3","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27457368\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11916-016-0579-3.pdf","pmid":"27457368","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Drug Interaction and Serotonin Toxicity with Opioid Use: Another Reason to Avoid Opioids in Headache and Migraine Treatment","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drug-interaction-serotonin-toxicity-opioid-another-reason-avoid-opioids-headache-migraine-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7492829,"mean":6.4903949042968,"rank":2814299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4646151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7492829,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250833,"mean":11.779410354341,"rank":84887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":164291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250833,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":3.6073082352941,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.0444444444444,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
