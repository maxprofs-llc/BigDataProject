All patients aged \u226518 years with a primary admitting diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage were included. Patients with a diagnosis of seizure were segregated from the initial cohort. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the risk of death while adjusting for severity of SAH as well as co-morbidities. The primary outcome of this analysis was in-hospital mortality.\n12,647 patients met inclusion criteria for the study, of which 1336 had a diagnosis of seizures. The unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher for patients with seizures compared to those without (16.2% vs 11.6%, p<0.01). Compared to patients without seizures, patients with seizures were younger (52.4 years SD 13.9 vs 54.8 years, SD 13.6; p<0.01), more likely to be male (35.6% vs 31.0%, p<0.01) and had longer hospital stays (18.3 days, IQR 12.0-27.5 vs 14.8 days, IQR 10.0-21.9; p<0.01). After adjusting for the severity of SAH, seizures were found to be associated with increased mortality (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.87, p<0.01).\nIn this large nationwide analysis, the presence of seizures in patients with SAH was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. This finding has potentially important implications for goals of care decision-making and prognostication, but further study in the area is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e0","authors":["Barret Rush","Katie WISKAR","Clark Fruhstorfer","Paul Hertz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.seizure.2016.07.008","first_seen_on":"2016-08-01T11:05:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2688"],"journal":"Seizure","last_mentioned_on":1470219562,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.seizure-journal.com\/article\/S1059-1311(16)30105-4\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes&rc=0&code=yseiz-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.seizure-journal.com\/article\/S1059131116301054\/pdf","pmid":"27491069","pubdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Association between seizures and mortality in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a nationwide retrospective cohort analysis","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-seizures-mortality-patients-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-nationwide-retros-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":4296067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3837008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257814,"mean":11.99476507391,"rank":140558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":116193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257814,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":903,"mean":3.2878181818182,"rank":519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":903,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.535625,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NatRevNeurol\/statuses\/760068856937414656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10179436],"posted_on":"2016-08-01T11:05:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Nat Rev Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrneurol\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1629167444\/nrneurol_Twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Nature Reviews Neurology is a clinical review journal from Nature Publishing Group.
