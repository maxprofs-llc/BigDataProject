Example from India free download"],"citation":{"abstract":"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the principal constituent of a variety of cells especially the brain neurons and retinal cells and plays important role in fetal brain development, development of motor skills, and visual acuity in infants, lipid metabolism, and cognitive support and along with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) it plays important role in preventing atherosclerosis, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and so forth. Being an essential nutrient, it is to be obtained through diet and therefore searching for affordable sources of these \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is important for consumer guidance and dietary counseling. Fish is an important source of PUFA and has unique advantage that there are many food fish species available and consumers have a wide choice owing to availability and affordability. The Indian subcontinent harbors a rich fish biodiversity which markedly varies in their nutrient composition. Here we report the DHA and EPA content and fatty acid profile of 39 important food fishes (including finfishes, shellfishes, and edible molluscs from both marine water and freshwater) from India. The study showed that fishes Tenualosa ilisha, Sardinella longiceps, Nemipterus japonicus, and Anabas testudineus are rich sources of DHA and EPA. Promotion of these species as DHA rich species would enhance their utility in public health nutrition.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Mohanty, Bimal Prasanna"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/4027437","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2016-09-02T19:58:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1472839556,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2016\/4027437\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2016\/4027437.pdf","pmid":"27579313","pubdate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","startpage":"1","title":"DHA and EPA Content and Fatty Acid Profile of 39 Food Fishes from India","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dha-epa-content-fatty-acid-profile-39-food-fishes-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":6311387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1126071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251837,"mean":12.500273686049,"rank":178493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":40749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251837,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4365,"mean":3.032357928506,"rank":2438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4365,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":10.870716981132,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
