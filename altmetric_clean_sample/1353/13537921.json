There is growing interest among patients in the use of nutraceuticals for the management of hypertension; as such, it is important that clinicians are prepared to engage in meaningful discussions with their patients about these substances. Flavonoids, beetroot, garlic, and unsaturated fats have garnered significant attention for their blood pressure lowering properties. We review the clinical evidence and reported mechanisms of action for these substances in an attempt to offer a practical guide for clinicians to engage with patients who are highly motivated to seek out nutraceutical therapies to manage their hypertension.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000704d","authors":["Turner, Jeffrey M","Spatz, Erica S"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11886-016-0806-x","first_seen_on":"2016-11-12T09:08:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-3170","1523-3782"],"issue":"12","journal":"Current Cardiology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1490223708,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27796863"],"pmid":"27796863","pubdate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Nutritional Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension: A Practical Guide for Clinicians","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-supplements-treatment-hypertension-practical-guide-clinicians-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":6071811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2024574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240008,"mean":13.186073572854,"rank":155098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":73368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240008,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":3.9900461095101,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":7.80625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
