We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory RESULTS: Poor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared to mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow-up. In late pregnancy depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy CONCLUSIONS: We found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectional associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy. This article is protected by copyright.
