All participants underwent clinical examination and 3T MRI using 3D T1-weighted imaging and DTI. DTI metrics were calculated within manually drawn regions of interest. Heart rate variability was evaluated using spectral analysis of the R-R cardiac interval during REM and slow-wave sleep based on continuous overnight electrocardiographic monitoring. Respiratory frequency was measured in 30-second contiguous epochs of REM and slow-wave sleep. The relationships between imaging and cardiac variables were calculated using partial correlations followed by the multiple comparisons permutation approach.\nThe changes in heart rate and respiratory frequency variability from slow-wave sleep to REM sleep in healthy controls were no longer detectable in patients with PD. There were significant increases in the mean (p = 0.006), axial (p = 0.006), and radial diffusivities (p = 0.005) in the medulla oblongata of patients with PD. In PD, diffusion changes were specifically correlated with a lower heart rate and respiratory frequency variability during REM sleep.\nThis study provides evidence that medulla oblongata damage underlies cardiac sympathetic\/vagal balance and respiratory dysfunction in patients with PD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Nadya Pyatigorskaya","Marie Mongin","Romain Valabregue","Lydia Yahia-Cherif","Claire Ewenczyk","Cyril Poupon","Eden Debellemaniere","Marie Vidailhet","Isabelle Arnulf","Stephane Leh\u00e9ricy"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.0000000000003426","first_seen_on":"2016-11-12T05:42:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-632X","0028-3878"],"journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1481838744,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/WNL.0000000000003426v1?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/11\/WNL.0000000000003426.short","http:\/\/m.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/11\/WNL.0000000000003426.short","http:\/\/neurology.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1212\/WNL.0000000000003426","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/11\/WNL.0000000000003426.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=gplus","http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/WNL.0000000000003426v1?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/11\/WNL.0000000000003426.full.pdf","pmid":"27837003","pubdate":"2016-11-12T22:01:25+00:00","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"10.1212\/WNL.0000000000003426","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Medulla oblongata damage and cardiac autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medulla-oblongata-damage-cardiac-autonomic-dysfunction-parkinson-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.05,"score_history":{"1y":18.05,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247238,"mean":6.9687663106984,"rank":471508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7775233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247238,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238143,"mean":13.143979214082,"rank":24525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":213586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238143,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9766,"mean":13.537311213518,"rank":1196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":8568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9766,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":30.72825,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
