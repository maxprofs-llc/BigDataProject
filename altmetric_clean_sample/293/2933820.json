There were observed deterioration of short-term and long-term memory, decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 17.3 \u00b1 10.4%; p \u2264 0.05) and their increase in a molecular layer of brain parietal cortex (for 36.9 \u00b1 9.2%) at the adult rats with normal embryogenesis after immobilization stress in comparison with control intact animals. At the rats subjected to a prenatal hypoxia, regardless of that, they were ex- posed to an immobilized stress at an adult stage or not, was noted both violation of short-term and long-term memory, and decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 22.9 \u00b1 10.5%) and parietal cortex (for 28.1 \u00b1 9.3%). The obtained data allow to conclude that the increase of plasticity providing adaptive behavior of animals, takes place in neocortical neuronal networks as a reply to a short-term repeating stress only at normal brain formation during embryo- genesis, while, violation of embryogenesis leads to decrease in plasticity and adaptive opportuni- ties of the nervous system during further ontogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccc0","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T19:05:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0869-8139"],"issue":"11","journal":"Rossi\u012dskii fiziologicheski\u012d zhurnal imeni I M Sechenova","last_mentioned_on":1417201447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25427377?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25427377","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"[Effects of repeated short-term immobilization stress on plastisity of brain cortical division and cognition in adult rats with normal and disturbed embryogenesis].","type":"article","volume":"99"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":3695311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146463,"mean":8.2211712116454,"rank":114774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146463,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":0.75312903225806,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.6875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/538408010364624896","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2933820],"posted_on":"2014-11-28T19:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"538408010364624896"}]}}
