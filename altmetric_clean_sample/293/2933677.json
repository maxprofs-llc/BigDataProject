This prevents sebum drainage, causing the formation of microcomedones, which spontaneously regress or become acne lesions when the pilosebaceous unit is further blocked by the accumulation of corneocytes. These conditions are favourable for the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, which further aggravates acne by enhancing abnormal desquamation, sebum production and inflammation. Also, skin fragility due to inflammation or irritation by anti-comedogenic agents can worsen the situation. Rhealba(\u00ae) Oat plantlet extract (Pierre Fabre Dermo Cosmetique) soothes and restores fragile skin in acne by reducing inflammation and inhibits bacterial adhesion of Propionibacterium acnes. Cosmeceuticals combining Rhealba(\u00ae) Oat plantlet extract and hydro-compensating actives, which are available with or without anti-comedogenic hydroxy acids, provide a balanced, multifaceted approach for acne patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f63","authors":["G Fabbrocini","M Saint Aroman"],"doi":"10.1111\/jdv.12791","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T17:47:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1468-3083"],"journal":"Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology","last_mentioned_on":1417288568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25428278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25428278","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Cosmeceuticals based on Rhealba(\u00ae) Oat plantlet extract for the treatment of acne vulgaris.","type":"article","volume":"28 Suppl s6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cosmeceuticals-based-rhealba-oat-plantlet-extract-treatment-acne-vulgaris"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4561959,"mean":5.3699941801311,"rank":2146991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2370628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4561959,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146549,"mean":8.2019864481263,"rank":64966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":80042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146549,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1172,"mean":1.9134124679761,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1172,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":3.4453125,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/acne_control\/status\/538388400663830529","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2933677],"posted_on":"2014-11-28T17:46:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Acne Treatment","url":"http:\/\/acne.yefl.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/823308785\/acne-treatment-logo1_normal.jpg","description":"Cure acne holistically, permanently, and without drugs or typical acne treatments.
