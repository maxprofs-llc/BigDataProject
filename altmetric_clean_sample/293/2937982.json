The objective of this systematic review was to obtain a precise summary of the efficacy and safety of doxepin as a hypnotic. We searched key databases and trial registers up to March 2014 and contacted pharmaceutical companies and the FDA for unpublished data. A total of nine randomized placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. Six studies were on doxepin 1-6\u00a0mg\/d, two on doxepin 25-300\u00a0mg\/d, and one on ramelteon 8\u00a0mg and doxepin 3\u00a0mg combined. All low-dose studies were industry-sponsored. We found that low-dose doxepin had a small to medium effect size against placebo for sleep maintenance and sleep duration but not for sleep initiation at both immediate and short-term posttreatment. There was no significant next-day residual effect with low-dose doxepin. Headache and somnolence were the most common side effects. We concluded that low-dose doxepin for 1-2 nights appeared to be safe and effective in improving sleep. However, a clear conclusion on its short-term benefits and risks as well as withdrawal effects was not possible due to the small number of studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894e","authors":["Yeung WF","Chung KF","Yung KP","Ng TH","Wing-Fai Yeung","Ka-Fai Chung","Kam-Ping Yung","Tommy Ho-Yee Ng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.smrv.2014.06.001","first_seen_on":"2014-12-01T04:25:16+00:00","issns":["1087-0792","10870792"],"issue":"","journal":"Sleep Medicine Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1502347150,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25047681","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.smrv.2014.06.001","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25047681"],"pmid":"25047681","pubdate":"2014-07-23T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Doxepin for insomnia: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doxepin-insomnia-systematic-review-randomized-placebocontrolled-trials-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":10,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":648836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7700753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241226,"mean":7.6750847963521,"rank":22331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":218779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241226,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":506,"mean":14.313136633663,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":506,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":21.502272727273,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
