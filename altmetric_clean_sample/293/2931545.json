The organic bridges of biphenyl-PMO in the pore walls act as donors and two types of dye are incorporated in the one-dimensional channels. Consecutive two-step-F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer is observed from the biphenyl moieties to mediators (diethyl-aminocoumarin or aminoacridone), followed by energy transfer from mediators to acceptors (dibenzothiacarbocyanine, indodicarbocyanine, sulforhodamine\u2005G). High energy-transfer efficiencies ranging from 70 to 80\u2009% are obtained for two-step-FRET, indicating that the mesochannel structure with one-dimensional ordering provides spatial arrangement of chromophore pairs for an efficient direct energy transfer. The emission wavelength can be tuned by a choice of acceptor dye: 477\u2005nm (diethylaminocoumarin), 519\u2005nm (aminoacridone), 567\u2005nm (sulforhodamine\u2005G), 630\u2005nm (dibenzothiacarbocyanine), and 692\u2005nm (indodicarbocyanine).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Gr\u00f6sch, Lyubov","Lee, Young Joo","Hoffmann, Frank","Fr\u00f6ba, Michael"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201403393","endpage":"346","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T22:59:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1417129177,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403393\/abstract;jsessionid=9C5766FB5522B86950AA18DE4F92F568.f02t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201403393\/pdf","pmid":"25352478","pubdate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"331","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Light\u2010Harvesting Three\u2010Chromophore Systems Based on Biphenyl\u2010Bridged Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lightharvesting-threechromophore-systems-based-biphenylbridged-periodic-mesoporous-organosilica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6276546,"mean":5.9870228254566,"rank":4641685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6276546,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193798,"mean":7.7620047162754,"rank":128232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193798,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2404,"mean":3.9281622971286,"rank":1385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2404,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":2.1238378378378,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
