By the same year, the population is expected to triple from 1 to 2.5-3 million. This article maps the predicted changes in temperature and rainfall and reviews the implications of climate change and population growth on agricultural systems. Improved cultivars of maize, rice, cassava, sweet potato and peanuts with high yield performance have been introduced, but these will need to be augmented in the future with better adapted cultivars and new crops, such as food and fodder legumes and new management practices. The requirements for fertilizers to boost yields and terracing and\/or contour hedgerows to prevent soil erosion of steeply sloping terrain are discussed. Contour hedges can also be used for fodder for improved animal production to provide protein to reduce malnutrition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f61000387f","authors":["Molyneux N","da Cruz GR","Williams RL","Andersen R","Turner NC"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13280-012-0287-0","endpage":"840","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T21:37:32+00:00","issns":["0044-7447","1654-7209"],"issue":"8","journal":"AMBIO - A Journal of the Human Environment","last_mentioned_on":1417210595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22569843\/?i=79&from=Timor-Leste"],"pmid":"22569843","pubdate":"2012-05-10T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Meteorology\/Climatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Geography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"823","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Climate Change and Population Growth in Timor Leste: Implications for Food Security.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/climate-change-population-growth-timor-leste-implications-food-security-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":3695311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146463,"mean":8.2211712116454,"rank":114774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146463,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":5.2164198895028,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":13.73072,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
