This study examined whether a Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention could augment natural reward processing through training in savoring as indicated by event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants were chronic pain patients at risk for opioid misuse who were randomized to 8\u00a0weeks of MORE (n\u00a0=\u00a011) or a support group control condition (n\u00a0=\u00a018). ERPs to images representing naturally rewarding stimuli (e.g., beautiful landscapes, intimate couples) and neutral images were measured before and after 8\u00a0weeks of treatment. Analyses focused on the late positive potential (LPP)-an ERP response in the 400-1,000\u00a0ms time window thought to index allocation of attention to emotional information. Treatment with MORE was associated with significant increases in LPP response to natural reward stimuli relative to neutral stimuli which were correlated with enhanced positive affective cue-responses and reductions in opioid craving from pre- to post-treatment. Findings suggest that cognitive training regimens centered on strengthening attention to natural rewards may remediate reward processing deficits underpinning addictive behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc0","authors":["Eric L.
