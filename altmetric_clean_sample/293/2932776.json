This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities, through micronuclei, and apoptosis by the sum of karyorrhexis, pyknosis and condensed chromatin in individuals with chronic periodontitis, gingivitis associated with biofilm and no periodontal disease. Materials and methods. This study included 72 individuals divided into three groups: gingivitis (n = 21), periodontitis (n = 24) and control (n = 27). Information on sociodemographic characteristics, health and lifestyle was obtained. Full mouth clinical examination was performed to define the periodontal condition. Exfoliated cells from gingival mucosa were collected for computation of micronuclei and nuclear changes indicative of apoptosis. The differences in the occurrence of endpoints (micronucleus, karyorrhexis, pyknosis and condensed chromatin) were evaluated using the conditional test to compare proportions in a rare events situation. Results. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of micronucleus (p > 0.1) between gingivitis, periodontitis and control groups. The occurrence of apoptosis was significantly higher among individuals with periodontitis compared to individuals with gingivitis (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.025). Conclusions. The findings showed that the inflammatory process generated by gingivitis and periodontitis is not related to a higher occurrence of chromosomal damage. However, the higher occurrence of apoptosis in individuals with periodontitis points to genotoxic effects induced by periodontal infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215b","authors":["Paulo de Tarso Jambeiro Brand\u00e3o","Isaac Suzart Gomes-Filho","Simone Seixas Cruz","Johelle de Santana Passos-Soares","Soraya Castro Trindade","Leonardo da Cunha Menezes Souza","Jos\u00e9 Roberto Cardoso Meireles","Eneida de Moraes Marc\u00edlio Cerqueira"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016357.2014.982705","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T11:43:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1502-3850"],"journal":"Acta Odontologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1417175012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25428625?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25428625","pubdate":"2014-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Can periodontal infection induce genotoxic effects?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/periodontal-infection-induce-genotoxic-effects"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":3695308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146462,"mean":8.22122392992,"rank":114774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146462,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":2.2472459016393,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.0272727272727,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
