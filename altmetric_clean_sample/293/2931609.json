We previously defined LPA and S1P signaling in proliferating human neural progenitor (hNP) cells, and the current study investigates their role in neuronal differentiation of these cells. Differentiation in the presence of LPA or S1P significantly enhanced cell survival and decreased expression of neuronal markers. Further, the LPA receptor antagonist Ki16425 fully blocked the effects of LPA, and differentiation in the presence of Ki16425 dramatically enhanced neurite length. LPA and S1P robustly activated Erk, but surprisingly both strongly suppressed Akt activation. Ki16425 and pertussis toxin blocked LPA activation of Erk but not LPA inhibition of Akt, suggesting distinct receptor and G-protein subtypes mediate these effects. Finally, we explored cross talk between lysophospholipid signaling and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LPA\/S1P effects on neuronal differentiation were amplified in the presence of LIF. Similarly, the ability of LPA\/S1P to regulate Erk and Akt was impacted by the presence of LIF; LIF enhanced the inhibitory effect of LPA\/S1P on Akt phosphorylation, while LIF blunted the activation of Erk by LPA\/S1P. Taken together, our results suggest that LPA and S1P enhance survival and inhibit neuronal differentiation of hNP cells, and LPA1 is critical for the effect of LPA. The pleiotropic effects of LPA may reflect differences in receptor subtype expression or cross talk with LIF receptor signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b73","authors":["Phillip Callihan","Mourad W Ali","Hector Salazar","Nhat Quach","Xian Wu","Steven L Stice","Shelley B Hooks"],"doi":"10.1177\/1759091414558416","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T00:06:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1759-0914"],"issue":"6","journal":"ASN Neuro","last_mentioned_on":1417133132,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25424429?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25424429","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Convergent Regulation of Neuronal Differentiation and Erk and Akt Kinases in Human Neural Progenitor Cells by Lysophosphatidic Acid, Sphingosine 1-Phosphate, and LIF: Specific Roles for the LPA1 Receptor.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/convergent-regulation-neuronal-differentiation-erk-akt-kinases-human-neural-progenitor-cells-lysopho"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4557392,"mean":5.3351066310155,"rank":3693410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4557392,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146369,"mean":8.1899960373853,"rank":114675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146369,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":2.678099009901,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
