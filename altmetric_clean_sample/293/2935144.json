Sixty (60) patients with MPS and having one active trigger point in the anterior masseter and anterior temporal muscles were selected and assigned randomly to six groups (n=10): Groups I to Ill were treated with GaAIAS (780 nm) laser, applied in continuous mode and in a meticulous way, twice a week, for four weeks. Energy was set to 25 J\/cm2, 60 J\/cm2 and 105 J\/cm2, respectively. Groups IV to VI were treated with placebo applications, simulating the same parameters as the treated groups. Pain scores were assessed just before, then immediately after the fourth application, immediately after the eighth application, at 15 days and one month following treatment. A significant pain reduction was observed over time (p<0.001). The analgesic effect of the LILT was similar to the placebo groups. Using the parameters described in this experiment, LILT was effective in reducing pain experienced by patients with myofascial pain syndrome. Thus, it was not possible to establish a treatment protocol. Analyzing the analgesic effect of LILT suggests it as a possible treatment of MPS and may help to establish a clinical protocol for this therapeutic modality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000584f","authors":["Carrasco TG","Guerisoli LD","Guerisoli DM","Mazzetto MO"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-29T13:38:08+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"CRANIO: The Journal of Craniomandibular Practice","last_mentioned_on":1417268247,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19891258?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=34"],"pmid":"19891258","pubdate":"2009-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Evaluation of low intensity laser therapy in myofascial pain syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-low-intensity-laser-therapy-myofascial-pain-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4561959,"mean":5.3699941801311,"rank":3696823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4561959,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146165,"mean":8.2275874907639,"rank":114621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146165,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.5192692307692,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.12,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Evaluation of low intensity laser therapy in myofascial pain syndrome. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100007568888626\/posts\/1510741709188111","license":"public","citation_ids":[2935144],"posted_on":"2014-11-29T13:37:27+00:00","summary":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov","author":{"name":"Fisiolife Sdn Bhd","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/100007568888626","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/100007568888626\/picture","id_on_source":"100007568888626"}}]}}
