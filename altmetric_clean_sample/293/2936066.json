To support the delivery of prevention in general dental practice in keeping with clinical guidelines, Childsmile sought accreditation for extended duty training for dental nurses to deliver clinical preventive care. This approach, has allowed extended duty dental nurses (EDDNs) to take on roles traditionally undertaken by general dental practitioners (GDPs). While skill-mix approaches have been found to work well in general medicine, they have not been formally evaluated in dentistry. Understanding the factors which influence nurses' ability to fully deliver their extended roles is necessary to ensure nurses' potential is reached and that children receive preventive care in line with clinical guidance in a cost-effective way. This paper investigates the supplementation of GDPs' roles by EDDNs, in general dental practice across Scotland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d0","authors":["Gnich W","Deas L","Mackenzie S","Burns J","Conway DI","Wendy Gnich","Leigh Deas","Sarah Mackenzie","Jacqueline Burns","David I Conway"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6831-14-137","first_seen_on":"2014-11-30T02:44:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6831",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Oral Health","last_mentioned_on":1417316362,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6831\/14\/137\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6831-14-137.pdf","pmid":"25421225","pubdate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"137","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Extending dental nurses' duties: a national survey investigating skill-mix in Scotland's child oral health improvement programme (Childsmile)","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1472-6831-14-137","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extending-dental-nurses-duties-national-survey-investigating-skillmix-scotlands-child-oral-health-im"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6995254,"mean":6.2523093632184,"rank":3190943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3746490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6995254,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229570,"mean":7.3447580553125,"rank":97445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":129867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229570,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":414,"mean":3.8166682808717,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":414,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":3.2244166666667,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
