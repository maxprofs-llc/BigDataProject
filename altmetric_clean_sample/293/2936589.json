We should not restrict ourselves to the oral cavity alone, but also explore the mind of an individual, for in it lays the hidden clue to successful management. In order to achieve this, we need to meet the mind of the child before meeting the mouth. Surmounting pressure on today's children builds a lot of anxiety in them, and this in turn is the foundation for various psychological problems. One such rare but important psychological disorder is \"trichotillomania.\" The present study is an attempt to provide an insight into this intriguing disorder based on a case report. The signs and symptoms of trichotillomania are discussed, and various management options are outlined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfc","authors":["Anegundi RT","Shetty SD","Yavagal C","Pandurangi A"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.2041-1626.2010.00001.x","first_seen_on":"2014-11-30T12:50:59+00:00","issns":["2041-1618"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Investigative and Clinical Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1417351826,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25427188"],"pmid":"25427188","pubdate":"2014-11-28T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Trichotillomania in children: the occult truth.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trichotillomania-children-occult-truth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4565650,"mean":5.3760928148882,"rank":3699923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4565650,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146340,"mean":8.2524974340402,"rank":114792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146340,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.0586666666667,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
