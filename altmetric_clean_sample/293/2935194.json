Two novel relatives to members of the caspase families metacaspases and paracaspase have been discovered. Metacaspase type-1 was identified in Acanthamoeba castellanii, an opportunistic protozoan parasite that causes severe diseases in humans. Paracaspase was found in the non-pathogenic protozoan Dictyostelium discoideum. Since their discovery in Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium, metacaspases and paracaspases have remained poorly characterized. At present we do not have sufficient data about the molecular function of these caspase-like proteins or their role, if any, in programmed cell death. How these caspase proteins function at the molecular level is an important area of study that will provide insight into their potential for treatment therapies against Acanthamoeba infection and other similar parasitic protozoan. Additionally, finding the molecular functions of these caspase-like proteins will provide information concerning their role in more complex organisms.The aim of this article was to review recent discoveries about metacaspases and paracaspases as regulators of apoptotic and non-apoptotic processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f89","authors":["Entsar Saheb","Wendy Trzyna","John Bush"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-29T14:04:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0973-7138"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Biosciences","last_mentioned_on":1417269791,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25431419?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25431419","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Caspase-like proteins: Acanthamoeba castellanii metacaspase and Dictyostelium discoideum paracaspase, what are their functions?","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caspaselike-proteins-acanthamoeba-castellanii-metacaspase-dictyostelium-discoideum-paracaspase-funct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4561959,"mean":5.3699941801311,"rank":3696823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4561959,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146164,"mean":8.2276420708388,"rank":114621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146164,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":2.0317993527508,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.93181818181818,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
