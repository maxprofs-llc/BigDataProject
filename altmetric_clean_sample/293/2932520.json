Therefore, the effective expression regulation of this gene is highly critical. UTR regions are of great significance to gene regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential regulatory role played by 5\u00b4UTR and 3\u00b4UTR of the Oct4 gene in mouse BMSC and P19 cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f04","authors":["Saeedeh Ghiasvand","Babak Bakhshinejad","Seyed Javad Mowla","Majid Sadeghizadeh"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T11:01:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-3866"],"issue":"7","journal":"Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1417172465,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25429339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25429339","pubdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Potential roles of 5\u00b4 UTR and 3\u00b4 UTR regions in post-trans-criptional regulation of mouse Oct4 gene in BMSC and P19 cells.","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4559875,"mean":5.3532196658184,"rank":3695306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":140561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4559875,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146463,"mean":8.2211643839358,"rank":114772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146463,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.4142990654206,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.69375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/status\/538286451457142784","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2932520],"posted_on":"2014-11-28T11:01:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"538286451457142784"}]}}
