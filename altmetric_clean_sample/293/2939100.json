During 1990-2011, an estimated 3\u2009278\u2009073 (95% confidence interval = 2\u2009762\u2009281-3\u2009793\u2009865) children <18 years old were treated in US emergency departments for toy-related injuries, averaging 149\u2009003 cases annually. The annual injury rate per 10\u2009000 children increased significantly by 39.9% from 18.88 in 1990 to 26.42 in 2011. The number and rate of injuries peaked at age 2 years; 63.4% of patients were male; and 80.3% of injuries occurred at home. Ride-on toys accounted for 34.9% of injuries and 42.5% of hospital admissions. This study is the first to comprehensively investigate toy-related injuries among children using a nationally representative data set. The increasing number and rate of toy-related injuries to children, especially those associated with ride-on toys, underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent these injuries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002570","authors":["Vihas M.
