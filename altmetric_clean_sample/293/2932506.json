The participants learned two unfamiliar sound sequences via different methods. In the tapping condition, they learned an auditory sequence while they tapped in synchrony with each sound onset. In the no tapping condition, they learned another sequence while they kept pressing a key until the sequence ended. After these learning sessions, we presented the two melodies again and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs). During the ERP recordings, 10% of the tones within each melody deviated from the original tones. An analysis of the grand average ERPs showed that deviant stimuli elicited a significant P300 in the tapping but not in the no-tapping condition. In addition, the significance of the P300 effect in the tapping condition increased as the participants showed highly synchronized tapping behavior during the learning sessions. These results indicated that single finger tapping promoted the conscious detection and evaluation of deviants within the learned sequences. The effect was related to individuals' musical ability to coordinate their finger movements along with external auditory events.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0e","authors":["Kamiyama, Keiko S.","Okanoya, Kazuo"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnhum.2014.00826","first_seen_on":"2014-11-28T10:56:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5161"],"journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1422622004,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnhum.2014.00826\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnhum.2014.00826\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4212678","pmid":"25400564","pubdate":"2014-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Synchronized tapping facilitates learning sound sequences as indexed by the P300","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synchronized-tapping-facilitates-learning-sound-sequences-indexed-p300"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691566,"mean":5.7075477914095,"rank":1789841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2886360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691566,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156656,"mean":8.246375857777,"rank":49120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":106776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156656,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2860,"mean":9.8687590066457,"rank":1427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2860,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":7.5309154228856,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
