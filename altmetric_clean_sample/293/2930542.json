Consumption of low-GI CHO foods may attenuate the insulin-mediated metabolic disturbances associated with CHO intake in the hours prior to exercise, better maintaining CHO availability. However, there is insufficient evidence that athletes who consume a low-GI CHO-rich meal prior to a prolonged event will gain clear performance benefits. The ingestion of CHO during prolonged exercise promotes CHO availability and enhances endurance and performance, and athletes usually chose CHO-rich foods and drinks of moderate to high GI to achieve this goal. Moderate- and high-GI CHO choices appear to enhance glycogen storage after exercise compared with low GI CHO-rich foods. However, the reason for this is not clear. A number of attributes of CHO-rich foods may be of value to the athlete including the nutritional value of the food or practical issues such as palatability, portability, cost gastric comfort, or ease of preparation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059b7","authors":["L M Burke","G R Collier","M Hargreaves"],"first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T16:21:52+00:00","issns":["1050-1606"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Sport Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1417097107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9841960"],"pmid":"9841960","pubdate":"1998-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Glycemic index--a new tool in sport nutrition?","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycemic-indexa-new-tool-sport-nutrition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4557392,"mean":5.3351066310155,"rank":2340056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1617667,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4557392,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145934,"mean":8.1603843133494,"rank":73429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145934,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":512,"mean":9.7394598825832,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":512,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.67,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
