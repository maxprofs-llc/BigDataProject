AF is associated with atrial remodeling processes, including changes in the expression and function of ion channels and signaling pathways. TWIK protein-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel (TASK)-1, a two-pore domain K(+) channel, has been shown to contribute to action potential repolarization as well as to the maintenance of resting membrane potential in isolated myocytes, and TASK-1 inhibition has been associated with the induction of perioperative AF. However, the role of TASK-1 in chronic AF is unknown. The present study investigated the function, expression, and phosphorylation of TASK-1 in chronic AF in atrial tissue from chronically paced canines and in human subjects. TASK-1 current was present in atrial myocytes isolated from human and canine hearts in normal sinus rhythm but was absent in myocytes from humans with AF and in canines after the induction of AF by chronic tachypacing. The addition of phosphatase to the patch pipette rescued TASK-1 current from myocytes isolated from AF hearts, indicating that the change in current is phosphorylation dependent. Western blot analysis showed that total TASK-1 protein levels either did not change or increased slightly in AF, despite the absence of current. In studies of perioperative AF, we have shown that phosphorylation of TASK-1 at Thr(383) inhibits the channel. However, phosphorylation at this site was unchanged in atrial tissue from humans with AF or in canines with chronic pacing-induced AF. We conclude that phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of TASK-1 is associated with AF, but the phosphorylation site responsible for this inhibition remains to be identified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Erin Harleton","Alessandra Besana","Parag Chandra","Peter Danilo","Tove S.
