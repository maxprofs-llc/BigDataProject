In many cases the peptides were designed by molecular dynamics calculations to evaluate the methods. The aim of this study was not only to improve passive permeability, but also to balance permeability with other physicochemical properties with the goal of understanding and applying the knowledge to develop active cyclic peptides into drug candidates. Evaluation of the methods herein suggest that increasing passive permeability often occurs at the expense of solubility and lipophilicity. Computational methods can be useful when attempting to predict and design features to balance these properties, though limitations were observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","doi":"10.1016\/j.bmc.2014.11.034","first_seen_on":"2014-11-30T10:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09680896"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1417376767,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0968089614008219"],"pmid":"25533323","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Improving the Passive Permeability of Macrocyclic Peptides: Balancing Permeability with other Physicochemical Properties ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-passive-permeability-macrocyclic-peptides-balancing-permeability-other-physicochemical-pro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4565650,"mean":5.3760928148882,"rank":1910227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2594482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4565650,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146341,"mean":8.2524365996994,"rank":54930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":89213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146341,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":938,"mean":1.892689434365,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":938,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.0753846153846,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
