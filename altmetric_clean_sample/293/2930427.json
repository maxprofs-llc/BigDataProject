It can be complicated by delirium, an acute disturbance of consciousness and cognition that develops over a short course with fluctuating symptoms. Patients with dementia who experience delirium tend to have slower resolution of symptoms, more adverse events, and poorer outcomes. There are significant health care expenditures associated with delirium. Many health care providers fail to recognize and diagnose delirium. The confusion assessment method is a suggested tool for diagnosing delirium. Delirium is multifactorial, occurring in an individual who has a predisposing factor (dementia is the number 1 risk factor) and is exposed to further precipitating risk factors that are often preventable. The main focus of treatment and management of delirium should be on prevention, which can be achieved through assessing patients for predisposing and precipitating factors. If a patient does develop delirium, a reassessment of precipitating factors is the first step in treatment, and then nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment can be considered. The use of antipsychotics or melatonin to treat delirium in dementia is considered off-label.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c40","authors":["Roden M","Simmons BB"],"doi":"10.3810\/pgm.2014.10.2827","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T15:58:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0032-5481"],"issue":"6","journal":"Postgraduate Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1417203659,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25414941","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25414941?utm_content=buffereca3a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25414941\/"],"pmid":"25414941","pubdate":"2014-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Delirium superimposed on dementia and mild cognitive impairment.","type":"article","volume":"126","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delirium-superimposed-dementia-mild-cognitive-impairment-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8381513,"mean":7.0626122897557,"rank":2044137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6316378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8381513,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240193,"mean":7.6135908772983,"rank":61918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":177389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240193,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":650,"mean":4.5712850539291,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":650,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.8907333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/semantic_bot\/status\/537974957691912192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2930427],"posted_on":"2014-11-27T14:23:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Berkeley Bot","url":"http:\/\/markfarrell.ca\/creal","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530906132680695808\/WJYpLqU8_normal.png","description":"Beep!
