Here we explored the possibility of developing a simple tool that could predict with good confidence the occurrence of DGF and could be helpful in current clinical practice. We built a score, tentatively called DGFS, from a French multicenter and prospective cohort of 1844 adult recipients of deceased donor kidneys collected since 2007, and computerized in the Donn\u00e9es Informatis\u00e9es et VAlid\u00e9es en Transplantation databank. Only five explicative variables (cold ischemia time, donor age, donor serum creatinine, recipient body mass index, and induction therapy) contributed significantly to the DGF prediction. These were associated with a good predictive capacity (area under the ROC curve at 0.73). The DGFS calculation is facilitated by an application available on smartphones, tablets, or computers at www.divat.fr\/en\/online-calculators\/dgfs. The DGFS should allow the simple classification of patients according to their DGF risk at the time of transplantation, and thus allow tailored-specific management or therapeutic strategies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Marion Chapal","Florent Le Borgne","Christophe Legendre","Henri Kreis","Georges Mourad","Val\u00e9rie Garrigue","Emmanuel Morelon","Fanny Buron","Lionel Rostaing","Nassim Kamar","Mich\u00e8le Kessler","Marc Ladri\u00e8re","Jean-Paul Soulillou","Katy Launay","Pascal Daguin","Lucile Offredo","Magali Giral","Yohann Foucher"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2014.188","endpage":"1139","first_seen_on":"2014-11-27T21:26:11+00:00","issns":["0085-2538"," 1523-1755"],"journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1442972373,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ki\/journal\/v86\/n6\/full\/ki2014188a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24897036"],"pmid":"24897036","pubdate":"2014-06-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1130","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"A useful scoring system for the prediction and management of delayed graft function following kidney transplantation from cadaveric donors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/useful-scoring-system-prediction-management-delayed-graft-function-following-kidney-transplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156778,"mean":6.8932433040581,"rank":3526247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4515087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156778,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237936,"mean":7.5676665223696,"rank":84239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":149552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237936,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2579,"mean":4.2983196276183,"rank":1329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2579,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":7.7934090909091,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
