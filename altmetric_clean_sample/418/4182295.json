The barium and zinc metal cations in the dinuclear complex are linked via one chloride anion and carboxyl-ate O atoms of the tri-phenyl-acetate ligands, giving a Ba\u22efZn separation of 3.9335\u2005(11)\u2005\u00c5. The irregular nine-coordinate BaO8Cl coordination centres comprise eight O-atom donors, six of them from 2-meth-oxy-ethanol ligands (four from two bidentate O,O'-chelate inter-actions and two from monodentate inter-actions), two from bridging tri-phenyl-acetate ligands and one from a bridging Cl donor. The distorted tetra-hedral coordination sphere of zinc comprises two O-atom donors from the tri-phenyl-acetate ligands and two Cl donors (one bridging and one terminal). In the crystal, O-H\u22efCl, O-H\u22efO and C-H\u22efCl inter-molecular inter-actions form a layered structure, lying parallel to (001).","authors":["Utko, J."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989015011226","endpage":"794","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T00:00:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1434585607,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989015011226="],"pmcid":"PMC4518960","pmid":"26279869","pubdate":"2015-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"791","title":"Crystal structure of a mixed-ligand dinuclear Ba-Zn complex with 2-meth\u00adoxy\u00adethanol having tri\u00adphenyl\u00adacetate and chloride bridges","type":"article","volume":"71"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5207216,"mean":6.1644978826512,"rank":3659981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":877144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5207216,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183340,"mean":8.4662054227416,"rank":128407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":34888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183340,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15870,"mean":3.3997823429328,"rank":8877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15870,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":612,"mean":3.0249361702128,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":612,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/status\/611322461553041410","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4182295],"posted_on":"2015-06-18T00:00:07+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"611322461553041410"}]}}
