A devitalized, cultivated Sphagnum palustre L. moss clone obtained from the \"Mossclone\" EU-FP7 Project was used for the optimization and validation of the proposed method. Good trueness (84-116%), precision (intermediate precision lower than 11%) and sensitivity (quantitation limits lower than 1.7ngg(-1)) were obtained. The proposed method was compared with other procedures applied for this complex matrix, achieving a considerable reduction of sample amount, solvent volume and time consumption. The procedure was successfully tested for the analysis of PAHs in exposed moss clone samples for the monitoring of air pollution. Finally, the method was also tested for its suitability in the analysis of PAHs in other moss species as well as a lichen species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Concha-Gra\u00f1a, Estefan\u00eda","Muniategui-Lorenzo, Soledad","De Nicola, Flavia","Aboal, Jes\u00fas R","Rey-Asensio, Ana Isabel","Giordano, Simonetta","Reski, Ralf","L\u00f3pez-Mah\u00eda, Purificaci\u00f3n","Prada-Rodr\u00edguez, Dar\u00edo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2015.06.014","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T08:20:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00219673","1873-3778"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1435227066,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967315008420","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26105781?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26105781","pubdate":"2015-06-25T10:11:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Matrix solid phase dispersion method for determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in moss.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matrix-solid-phase-dispersion-method-determination-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons-moss-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5278180,"mean":6.2101388035557,"rank":2800614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1791904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5278180,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184894,"mean":8.5184606556226,"rank":102606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184894,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2092,"mean":1.9834079387853,"rank":694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2092,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.3966666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
