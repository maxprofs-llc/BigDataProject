Buffered local anesthetics have been purported to improve anesthetic success. Buffering a 4% articaine formulation may increase the success of a mandibular first molar buccal infiltration. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of pulpal anesthesia obtained with a buffered 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine formulation versus a nonbuffered 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine formulation as a primary buccal infiltration of the mandibular first molar.\nEighty adults randomly received mandibular buccal infiltrations using 4% articaine with 100,000 epinephrine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (18 mEq) and 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in a double-blind manner at 2 separate appointments. An electric pulp tester was used to test the first molar for pulpal anesthesia every 30\u00a0seconds for the first 5\u00a0minutes and every minute for the remaining 55\u00a0minutes. Successful pulpal anesthesia was defined as 2 consecutive 80\/80 readings with the electric pulp tester. Pain ratings for each injection were recorded as well as the onset time of pulpal anesthesia.\nAnesthetic success rates for buffered articaine and nonbuffered articaine were 71% and 65%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the formulations (P\u00a0=\u00a0.3018). No significant differences were found between the 2 formulations for pain of injection or onset of anesthesia.\nBuffered articaine did not provide any advantage over nonbuffered articaine for anesthetic success, anesthesia onset, or pain of injection for a primary buccal infiltration of the mandibular first molar.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Shurtz, Ryan","Nusstein, John","Reader, Al","Drum, Melissa","Fowler, Sara","Beck, Mike"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2015.05.005","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T05:51:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0099-2399","1878-3554"],"journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1441426840,"links":["http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099-2399(15)00448-3\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26095381?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26095381\/","http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099-2399(15)00448-3\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=0099-2399_201509_41_9_&amp%3Belsca4=Dentistry#.Vem2m9nPP98.facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099239915004483\/pdf","pmid":"26095381","pubdate":"2015-06-23T10:07:34+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Buffered 4% Articaine as a Primary Buccal Infiltration of\u00a0the\u00a0Mandibular First Molar: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-blind Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/buffered-4-articaine-primary-buccal-infiltration-mandibular-first-molar-prospective-randomized-doubl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6288077,"mean":5.8075355641343,"rank":2963548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1890176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6288077,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190669,"mean":8.5334599827976,"rank":105640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":66595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190669,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":789,"mean":1.3853096446701,"rank":185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":789,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.3115384615385,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":4,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"CL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/611773111365672960","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4187627],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T05:50:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
