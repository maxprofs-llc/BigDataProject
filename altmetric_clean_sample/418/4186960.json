The Heck reaction of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone) with 1-bromo-3-methyl-2-butene offered easy access to lapachol. Several naturally occurring linear and angular heterocyclic quinoids (\u03b1-lapachone, \u03b2-lapachone, dunnione, and related analogues) were prepared from lapachol. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the synthetic naphthoquinones inhibit cell proliferation in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In particular, angular-type derivatives were found to possess moderate cytotoxicity and to elevate the levels of intracellular glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Our work highlights the significant potential of naturally occurring angular-series naphthoquinones as antileukemic agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e5f","authors":["Inagaki, Ryuta","Ninomiya, Masayuki","Tanaka, Kaori","Koketsu, Mamoru","Ryuta Inagaki","Masayuki Ninomiya","Kaori Tanaka","Mamoru Koketsu"],"doi":"10.1002\/cmdc.201500189","endpage":"1423","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T00:52:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1860-7187","18607179"],"issue":"8","journal":"ChemMedChem","last_mentioned_on":1490443306,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201500189\/abstract;jsessionid=C9E5A49968C6B351D01863EA36ED6CE4.f01t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26088596"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cmdc.201500189\/pdf","pmid":"26088596","pubdate":"2015-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1413","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacology"],"title":"Synthesis, Characterization, and Antileukemic Properties of Naphthoquinone Derivatives of Lawsone","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/cmdc.201500189","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-characterization-antileukemic-properties-naphthoquinone-derivatives-lawsone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3962902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4417552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229465,"mean":8.3748617735244,"rank":100971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":127119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229465,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1323,"mean":2.4527534039334,"rank":390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1323,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.085,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
