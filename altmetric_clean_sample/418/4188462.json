Irf6-Related Gene Regulatory Network Involved in Palate and Lip Development gs8094@b\u2026"],"citation":{"abstract":"Numerous genes including Irf6 have been revealed to contribute to cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL\/P). In this study, we performed a systematic bioinformatics analysis of Irf6-related gene regulatory network involved in palate and lip development by using GeneDecks, DAVID, STRING, and GeneMANIA database. Our results showed that many CL\/P candidate genes have relation with Irf6, and 9 of these genes, including Msx1, Pvrl1, Pax9, Jag2, Irf6, Tgfb3, Rara, Gli2, and Tgfb2, were enriched into the CL\/P gene group. Some of these 9 genes also were commonly involved in different signaling pathways and different biological processes, and they also have protein-protein interactions with Irf6. These findings make us analyze the intricate function of Irf6 in a CL\/P gene regulatory network, followed by guiding us to perform further functional studies on these genes in the future. This method also offers us a simple, cheap, but useful method to analyze the relationship with a gene regulatory network of a certain disease such as CL\/P.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Dai, Jiewen","Yu, Hongbo","Si, Jiawen","Fang, Bing","Shen, Steve Guofang"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000001526","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T10:23:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3732","1049-2275"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1454098179,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26086926?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2015\/07000\/Irf6_Related_Gene_Regulatory_Network_Involved_in.35.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26086926"],"pmid":"26086926","pubdate":"2015-06-19T22:02:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Irf6-Related Gene Regulatory Network Involved in Palate and Lip Development.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/irf6related-gene-regulatory-network-involved-palate-lip-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":1660157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4560942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222461,"mean":7.9952415445474,"rank":65726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":152619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222461,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3241,"mean":0.65356296296296,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":3124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3241,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":0.70718954248366,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/skim_lab\/status\/611841657474945025","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4188462],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T10:23:13+00:00","author":{"name":"BiocomputingLab@TGen","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"skim_lab","tweeter_id":"2806820977","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"611841657474945025"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bionet_papers\/status\/611843007373914112","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4188462],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T10:28:35+00:00","author":{"name":"BioNetPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848204009055948801\/lkerJJYd_normal.jpg","description":"A feed for papers in network biology.","id_on_source":"bionet_papers","tweeter_id":"2384073290","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":74},"tweet_id":"611843007373914112"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCSOnline1\/statuses\/635069485980905472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4188462],"posted_on":"2015-08-22T12:42:19+00:00","author":{"name":"JCS Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcraniofacialsurgery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1397343347\/JCranioSurg_square_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery serves as a forum of communication for all those involved in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery.","id_on_source":"JCSOnline1","tweeter_id":"317871694","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":118},"tweet_id":"635069485980905472"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ammegandchips\/statuses\/640886399550537728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4188462],"posted_on":"2015-09-07T13:56:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Gemma Sharp","url":"http:\/\/www.bris.ac.uk\/dental\/people\/gemma-c-sharp\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/740662217322958848\/Isjfq0Io_normal.jpg","description":"Lecturer in molecular epidemiology at the University of Bristol.
