Forty-two patients suffering CC at different stages were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we proposed a new tumor segmentation method by combining the intensity and gradient field information in a level set framework. Secondly, fifty-four 3D texture features were studied besides of SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Through correlation analysis, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, some independent indices showed statistically significant differences between the early stage (ES, stages I and II) and the advanced stage (AS, stages III and IV). Then the tumors represented by those independent indices could be automatically classified into ES and AS, and the most discriminative feature could be chosen. Finally, the robustness of the optimal index with respect to sampling schemes and the quality of the PET images were validated. Using the proposed segmentation method, the dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance were 91.78\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20091.66% and 7.94\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20091.99\u2009mm, respectively. According to the correlation analysis, all the fifty-eight indices could be divided into 20 groups. Six independent indices were selected for their highest areas under the ROC curves (AUROC), and showed significant differences between ES and AS (P\u2009\u2009<\u2009\u20090.05). Through automatic classification with the support vector machine (SVM) Classifier, run percentage (RP) was the most discriminative index with the higher accuracy (88.10%) and larger AUROC (0.88). The Pearson correlation of RP under different sampling schemes is 0.9991\u2009\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u2009\u20090.0011. RP is a highly stable feature and well correlated with tumor stage in CC, which suggests it could differentiate ES and AS with high accuracy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000330e","authors":["Mu, Wei","Chen, Zhe","Liang, Ying","Shen, Wei","Yang, Feng","Dai, Ruwei","Wu, Ning","Tian, Jie","Wei Mu","Zhe Chen","Ying Liang","Wei Shen","Feng Yang","Ruwei Dai","Ning Wu","Jie Tian"],"doi":"10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/13\/5123","endpage":"5139","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T07:17:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1361-6560","0031-9155"],"issue":"13","journal":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1453977160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26083460?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/13\/5123"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/13\/5123\/pdf","pmid":"26083460","pubdate":"2015-06-19T22:22:46+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"5123","subjects":["biophysics","biology"],"title":"Staging of cervical cancer based on tumor heterogeneity characterized by texture features on 18F-FDG PET images","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/staging-cervical-cancer-based-tumor-heterogeneity-characterized-texture-features-sup18sup-ffdg-pet-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":3304319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3569796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222441,"mean":7.9949686297429,"rank":107481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":105431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222441,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1199,"mean":2.0138230383973,"rank":358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1199,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":0.73461538461538,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/status\/611178114471829504","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4187770],"posted_on":"2015-06-17T14:26:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"611178114471829504"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/statasiore\/status\/611794832235864064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4187770],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T07:17:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Stephen Tatasciore","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868366724428693505\/Les1CNnn_normal.jpg","description":"2017 Edition - I'm a very lucky Father of three fantastic kids, enjoying life one day at a time!
