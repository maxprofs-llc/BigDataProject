This retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a predictive model for CKD progression in children with INS.\nBetween 1970 and 2012, a total of 294 patients with INS were followed up. The primary outcome was progression to CKD stage 3 or higher. A predictive model was developed using a Cox proportional hazards model. A score was calculated using b-coefficients and summing up points assigned to each significant variable. Prognostic score was grouped into categories: low risk, medium risk, and high risk.\nMedian follow-up was 6.9\u00a0years. Median renal survival was 26.1\u00a0years and probability of CKD stage 3 or higher was 8\u00a0% in 10\u00a0years. Multivariate analysis showed that the most accurate model included initial age, hematuria, and steroid resistance. Accuracy was high with a c-statistic of 0.95 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.99), 0.92 (95\u00a0% CI 0.88-0.96), and 0.92 (95\u00a0% CI 0.87-0.97) at 2, 5, and 10\u00a0years\u00a0of follow-up respectively. By survival analysis, 10-year renal survival was 100\u00a0% for the low-risk and 95\u00a0% for the medium-risk group, while 40\u00a0% of high-risk patients would exhibit CKD stage 3 or higher (P\u2009<\u20090.001).\nOur predictive model of CKD may contribute to the early identification of a subgroup of INS patients at a high risk of renal dysfunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b0","authors":["Ana Carmen Quaresma Mendon\u00e7a","Eduardo Ara\u00fajo Oliveira","Brunna Pinto Fr\u00f3es","Lauro Damasceno Carvalho Faria","Juliana Silva Pinto","Maira Melo Ibrahim Nogueira","Gabriella Oliveira Lima","Priscila Isa Resende","Nat\u00e1lia Silva Assis","Ana Cristina Sim\u00f5es e Silva","S\u00e9rgio Veloso Brant Pinheiro"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00467-015-3136-0","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T11:57:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-198X"],"journal":"Pediatric Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1434714989,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00467-015-3136-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00467-015-3136-0.pdf","pmid":"26084617","pubdate":"2015-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Urology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology","pediatrics"],"title":"A predictive model of progressive chronic kidney disease in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictive-model-progressive-chronic-kidney-disease-idiopathic-nephrotic-syndrome-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5251998,"mean":6.1864646685839,"rank":4372218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5251998,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184508,"mean":8.5194257670441,"rank":149470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184508,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":912,"mean":1.705607025247,"rank":742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":912,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.2575471698113,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ASPNeph\/status\/611865128884047872","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4188835],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T11:56:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Am Soc Ped Neph","url":"http:\/\/www.aspneph.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585457273931075584\/Fsll3LT0_normal.jpg","description":"Promoting optimal care for children with kidney disease through advocacy, education & research; and disseminating advances in clinical practice & investigation","id_on_source":"ASPNeph","tweeter_id":"1392927266","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2127},"tweet_id":"611865128884047872"}]}}
