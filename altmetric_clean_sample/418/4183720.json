Thirty-three patients underwent surgical revascularization (surgical group) and 35 patients underwent AIS (AIS group). Preoperative clinical factors and outcome data including complications, ankle-brachial index and mortality were collected. Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival, limb salvage and patency were analyzed.\nPreoperative risk factors were similar between the two groups. Surgical group were younger than AIS group ((56\u00b111) years vs. (65\u00b110) years, t=-2.789, P=0.008) with more patients manifesting rest pain (23\/33 vs.15\/35, \u03c7(2)=4.963, P=0.026) and relative higher perioperative mortality (3\/33 vs. 0\/35, P=0.109). Mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly in both groups after operation (Surgical group 0.90\u00b10.15 vs. 0.43\u00b10.20, t=-7.849, P=0.000; AIS group 0.85\u00b10.20 vs. 0.41\u00b10.25, t=-5.379, P=0.000). Postoperative complications occurred, with statistically higher rates of respiratory failure, transient renal dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in surgical group (\u03c7(2)=6.98, P=0.010; \u03c7(2)=9.62, P=0.000; P=0.023). The 5-year primary patency in surgical group was 90.2%, compared with 64.2% in AIS group (\u03c7(2)=3.717, P=0.054). No difference was observed in survival rate, limb salvage and secondary patency between the two groups.\nFive-year primary patency of endovascular reconstruction for chronic aortoiliac occlusion is lower than that for traditional open surgery. Open surgery is still the first choice for the patients who can endure the surgery. Endovascular treatment is an option for patients with high risk. However, additional interventional treatment is needed in some cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccb4","authors":["Lun, Yu","Zhang, Jian","Shen, Shikai","Gang, Qingwei","Wu, Xiaoyu","Jiang, Han","Xin, Shijie","Duan, Zhiquan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T10:02:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0529-5815"],"issue":"5","journal":"Zhonghua wai ke za zhi Chinese journal of surgery","last_mentioned_on":1434621635,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26082253?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26082253","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Comparison of mid-term outcomes between surgical treatment and endovascular reconstruction for chronic aortoiliac occlusion].","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-midterm-outcomes-between-surgical-treatment-endovascular-reconstruction-chronic-aortoilia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234334,"mean":6.1825716182004,"rank":4356937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234334,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184396,"mean":8.4860390574583,"rank":149421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184396,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231,"mean":0.41804347826087,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
