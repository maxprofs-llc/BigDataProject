Strategies that use ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to eliminate the product of a gene of interest, such as heat-inducible degron (td) and auxin-inducible degron (AID), are powerful methods for constructing conditional mutants. However, these methods do not work with some genes. Here, we describe an improved AID system (iAID) for isolating tight conditional mutants in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this method, transcriptional repression by the 'Tet-OFF' promoter is combined with proteolytic elimination of the target protein by the AID system. To provide examples, we describe the construction of tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast. Therefore, the iAID system is not only useful in budding yeast, but also can be applied to other model systems to isolate tight conditional mutants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d3c","authors":["Tanaka, Seiji","Miyazawa-Onami, Mayumi","Iida, Tetsusi","Araki, Hiroyuki","Miyazawa\u2010Onami, Mayumi","Iida, Tetsushi"],"doi":"10.1002\/yea.3080","endpage":"581","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T13:45:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1097-0061"],"issue":"8","journal":"Yeast","last_mentioned_on":1436436826,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26081484?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/yea.3080\/abstract;jsessionid=44EB9A658FACF719DED35EFE2CF7D711.f04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/yea.3080\/pdf","pmid":"26081484","pubdate":"2015-06-18T22:04:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"567","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"iAID: an improved auxin\u2010inducible degron system for the construction of a \u2018tight\u2019 conditional mutant in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iaid-improved-auxininducible-degron-system-construction-tight-conditional-mutant-budding-yeast-sacch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6401173,"mean":5.984074773182,"rank":2623431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3633737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6401173,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188435,"mean":8.5480315972702,"rank":85669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":96169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188435,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.6332067510549,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.575,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
