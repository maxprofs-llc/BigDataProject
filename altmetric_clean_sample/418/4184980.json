These agents target cartilage with high specificity and this property is inherent to the chemical structure of the fluorophore. After a single low-dose intravenous injection and a clearance time of approximately 4 h, these agents bind to all three major types of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, and fibrocartilage) and perform equally well across species. Analysis of the chemical structure similarities revealed a potential pharmacophore for cartilage targeting. Our results lay the foundation for future improvements in tissue engineering, joint surgery, and cartilage-specific drug development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Hyun, Hoon","Owens, Eric A.","Wada, Hideyuki","Levitz, Andrew","Park, GwangLi","Park, Min Ho","Frangioni, John V.","Henary, Maged","Choi, Hak Soo","Owens, Eric A","Frangioni, John V"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201502287","endpage":"8652","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T16:21:35+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"30","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
