In contrast, the reverse reaction, retro-hydroformylation, has seldom been studied. The retro-hydroformylation reaction of an aldehyde into an alkene and synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and dihydrogen) in the presence of a cyclopentadienyl iridium catalyst is now reported. Aliphatic aldehydes were converted into the corresponding alkenes in up to 91\u2009% yield with concomitant release of carbon monoxide and dihydrogen. Mechanistic control experiments indicated that the reaction proceeds by retro-hydroformylation and not by a sequential decarbonylation-dehydrogenation or dehydrogenation-decarbonylation process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Kusumoto, Shuhei","Tatsuki, Toshiumi","Nozaki, Kyoko"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201503620","endpage":"8461","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T00:03:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"29","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
