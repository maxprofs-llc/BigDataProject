Replacing such sensations temporarily after cessation may enhance treatment efficacy. We hypothesised that De-nicotinised cigarettes (DNCs), which have a very low nicotine content but provide these sensory and behavioural stimuli, could help alleviate urges to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and in turn enhance the efficacy of ST.\nTwo-hundred smokers seeking treatment received 9 weekly BS sessions and pharmacotherapy (100 used varenicline, 100 used NRT). They were randomised on the Target Quit Day (TQD) to receive 280 DNCs (used ad lib over 2 weeks in addition to ST), or ST alone.\nUrge-to-smoke frequency (2.61 vs. 2.96, p=0.03), but not strength (2.85 vs. 3.10, p=0.20) in the first week of abstinence was significantly lower in DNC users vs. ST alone. There were no differences in composite withdrawal scores between groups. Abstinence was significantly higher among DNC users vs. ST alone at one (OR=2.07, 95%CI: 1.63-3.70) and four weeks (OR=1.83, 95%CI: 1.05-3.21), but not at 12 weeks (OR=1.42, 95% CI: 0.79-2.55). DNC use was a significant predictor of abstinence at 1 and 4 weeks (OR=2.63; 95%CI: 1.40-4.93; and OR= 2.38; 95%CI: 1.26-4.46), but not at 12 weeks.\nAdding DNCs to ST has the potential to assist smokers early in their quit attempt, but research is needed to determine how best to utilise DNCs in treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50f3cf058f6100031e0","authors":["McRobbie, Hayden","Przulj, Dunja","Myers Smith, Katherine","Cornwall, Danielle"],"doi":"10.1093\/ntr\/ntv122","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T13:41:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1469-994X"],"journal":"Nicotine & Tobacco Research","last_mentioned_on":1434721184,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26045250"],"pmid":"26045250","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Complementing the standard multicomponent treatment for smokers with de-nicotinised cigarettes: A Randomised trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complementing-standard-multicomponent-treatment-smokers-denicotinized-cigarettes-randomized-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5252083,"mean":6.1865725188618,"rank":2785140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1783794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5252083,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184529,"mean":8.5192643826411,"rank":102325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184529,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":949,"mean":9.4842489451477,"rank":627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":949,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":9.3260666666667,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
