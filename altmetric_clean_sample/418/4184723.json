Virol: Emergence of an HPAI H5N9 virus In China"],"citation":{"abstract":"The Novel H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV), was demonstrated to cause severe human respiratory infections in China. Here, we examined poultry specimens from live bird markets linked to human H7N9 infection in Hangzhou, China. Metagenomic sequencing revealed mixed subtypes (H5, H7, H9, N1, N2 and N9). Subsequently AIV subtypes H5N9, H7N9 and H9N2 were isolated. Evolutionary analysis showed that the hemagglutination and neuraminidase genes of the novel H5N9 virus originated from A\/Muscovy duck\/Vietnam\/LBM227\/2012 (H5N1) belonging to Clade 2.3.2.1 and human-infective A\/Hangzhou\/1\/2013 (H7N9), six internal genes were similar to those of the H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The virus harbored the PQRERRRKR\/GL motif characteristic of highly pathogenic AIVs at the HA cleavage site. Receptor-binding experiments demonstrated that the virus binds \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid, but not \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid. Identically, pathogenicity experiment also showed that the virus caused low mortality rates in mice. This newly isolated H5N9 virus is a highly pathogenic reassortant virus originating from H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes. Live bird markets represent a potential transmission risk to public health and the poultry industry.\nThis investigation confirm that the novel H5N9 subtype avian influenza A virus is a reassortant strain originating from H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 subtypes, which is totally different from those H5N9 viruses reported before. The novel H5N9 virus got a highly pathogenic H5 gene and an N9 gene from human-infecting H7N9, but caused low mortality rates in mice. Whether this novel H5N9 virus will cause human infections from its avian host and become a pandemic subtype, is not known yet. So it is interesting to assess the risk of the emergence of novel reassortant virus with potential transmissibility to public health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Yang Yu","Xingbo Wang","Tao Jin","Hailong Wang","Weiying Si","Hui Yang","Jiusheng Wu","Yan Yan","Guang Liu","Xiaoyu Sang","Yuwei Gao","Xianzhu Xia","Xinfen Yu","Jingcao Pan","George F.
