However, if the target product describes a glycoprotein, an \u03b1-1,6-mannosyltransferase located in the Golgi apparatus of P. pastoris, called OCH1, triggers hypermannosylation of the recombinant protein which significantly impedes following unit operations and hampers biopharmaceutical product applications. A knockout of the och1 gene allows the production of less-glycosylated proteins-however, morphology and physiology of P. pastoris also change, complicating the upstream process. Here, we describe a controlled and efficient bioprocess based on the specific substrate uptake rate (q s) for a recombinant P. pastoris OCH1 knockout strain expressing a peroxidase as model protein.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Gmeiner, Christoph","Spadiut, Oliver"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2760-9_7","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T14:16:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1434636994,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26082217?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26082217","pubdate":"2015-06-18T22:03:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Protein Production with a Pichia pastoris OCH1 Knockout Strain in Fed-Batch Mode.","type":"article","volume":"1321","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-production-pichia-pastoris-och1-knockout-strain-fedbatch-mode"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234334,"mean":6.1825716182004,"rank":4356926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234334,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184395,"mean":8.4860376259532,"rank":149421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184395,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4105,"mean":1.4734288499025,"rank":2630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.2989122807018,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
