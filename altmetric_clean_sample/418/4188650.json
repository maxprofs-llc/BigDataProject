The results showed that starch content and activity of amylases significantly decreased during 10 weeks of cold storage, soluble protein content raised at first then decreased, and the peak appeared at the 6th week. However, total soluble sugar content which in- creased slowly at first than rose sharply and reducing sugar content increased during the storage duration. The bulbs with cold storage treatment rooted in the 6th week, which was about 2 weeks earlier than room temperature storage, but there were less new roots in the late period of storage. After stored at a low temperature, bud lengths were longer than that with room temperature treatment. Cold storage treatment could promote earlier emergence, shorten germination time, prolong growth period and improve the yield of bulb, but rarely affect the emergence rate. It was not beneficial to flowering and fruiting. The results indicated that 6-8 weeks of cold storage was deemed to be the key period of dormancy breaking preliminary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc89","authors":["Yang, Ying","Zhu, Zai-Biao","Guo, Qiao-Sheng","Miao, Yuan-Yuan","Ma, Hong-Liang","Yang, Xiao-Hua"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T11:00:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-5302"],"issue":"1","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi China journal of Chinese materia medica","last_mentioned_on":1434711606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25993786?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25993786","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies","pharmacology"],"title":"[Effects of low temperature on dormancy breaking and growth after planting in bulbs of Tulipa edulis].","type":"article","volume":"40"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5251998,"mean":6.1864646685839,"rank":4372218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5251998,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184509,"mean":8.5193809482516,"rank":149470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184509,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":0.73913596491228,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":0.51395348837209,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/status\/611850938370797569","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4188650],"posted_on":"2015-06-19T11:00:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
