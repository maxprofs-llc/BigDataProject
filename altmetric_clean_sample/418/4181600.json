Among the differential diagnoses of anorexia, it is important to underline the preponderant place occupied by Crohn's disease.\nWe report three cases of young 18 to 25 year-old girls, initially treated for anorexia nervosa in a psychiatric department. Diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made within 5 to 13 years. The clinical and biological characteristics are reported for each case.\nIn view of the frequency of digestive disorders concomitant to eating disorders, the distinction between anorexia and digestive disease is particularly delicate. It requires appropriate somatic and biological assessment that, when confronted with clinical and\/or biological atypia, may query the initial diagnosis of anorexia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b8","authors":["Blanchet, C","Luton, J P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T19:21:56+00:00","issns":["0755-4982"],"issue":"7","journal":"La Presse M\u00e9dicale (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1337918576,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11899685"],"pmid":"11899685","pubdate":"2002-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","generalsurgery"],"title":"[Anorexia nervosa and Crohn disease: diagnostic intricacies and difficulties. 3 cases].","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anorexia-nervosa-crohn-disease-diagnostic-intricacies-difficulties-3-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3996054,"mean":5.0370894469909,"rank":918535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2530049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3996054,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101637,"mean":6.7698502859057,"rank":27784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":71229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101637,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":1.9030223642173,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":10.299142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
