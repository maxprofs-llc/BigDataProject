Modifying the size and composition of a free cluster in a controlled way enables the modification of local charge effects and of spin states, and spectroscopic studies in combination with computational work help to identify the active site of a catalyst and to unravel mechanistic details. Also, the interplay of the support material with the reactive part of a composite catalyst cluster can be addressed. Examples will be presented demonstrating how and why the gas-phase reactivities of heteronuclear clusters, in comparison with their homonuclear counterparts, toward small, generally rather inert molecules can be increased, decreased, or not significantly affected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Schwarz, Helmut"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201500649","endpage":"10100","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T21:48:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"35","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
