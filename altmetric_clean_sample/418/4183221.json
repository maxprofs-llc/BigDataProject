Continuous accumulation of ROS triggers oxidative stress leading to hyper-activation of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, survival, and metabolic adaptation to the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, antioxidants are proposed to contribute to cancer prevention. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a crucial regulator of diverse cellular processes and contributes to cancer progression. The activation of PKC is partially dependent on ROS signaling. In the present study, cancer preventive activity of natural flavonoid quercetin is analyzed in ascite cells of Dalton's lymphoma-bearing mice. The total ROS level and activity of PKC were downregulated after quercetin treatment in lymphoma-bearing mice. Quercetin modulates the expression of almost all isozymes of classical, novel, and atypical PKC as well as downregulates the level and expression of PKC\u03b1. Further, quercetin improves apoptotic potential, as observed by the levels of caspase 3, caspase 9, PARP, PKC\u03b4, and nuclear condensation. Additionally, quercetin reduces cell survival and promotes death receptor-mediated apoptosis via differential localization of the TNFR1 level in ascite cells. The overall result suggests the cancer preventive activity of quercetin via the induction of apoptosis and modulates PKC signaling with the reduction of oxidative stress in ascite cells of lymphoma-bearing mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Maurya, Akhilendra Kumar","Vinayak, Manjula"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-015-3634-5","first_seen_on":"2015-06-18T07:14:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1434611644,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26076811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26076811","pubdate":"2015-06-18T22:08:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Modulation of PKC signaling and induction of apoptosis through suppression of reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1): key role of quercetin in cancer prevention.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-pkc-signaling-induction-apoptosis-through-suppression-reactive-oxygen-species-tumor-necro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234334,"mean":6.1825716182004,"rank":2774568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1778864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234334,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184395,"mean":8.4860582339991,"rank":102148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184395,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1538,"mean":0.95828106701366,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1538,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":0.69512,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
