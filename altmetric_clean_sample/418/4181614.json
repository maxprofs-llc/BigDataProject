A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies was performed to compare IM nailing with plating for distal tibia fractures without articular involvement and to determine the dominant strategy.\nThe PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, Chinese Wan-Fang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched.\nTwenty-eight studies, which included 1863 fractures, met the eligible criteria. The meta-analysis did not identify a statistically significant difference between the two treatments in terms of the rate of deep infection, delayed union, removal of instrumentation, or secondary procedures either in the RCT or retrospective subgroups. IM nailing was associated with significantly more malunion events and a higher incidence of knee pain in the retrospective subgroup and across all the studies, but not significantly in the RCT subgroup, and a lower rate of delayed wound healing and superficial infection both in the RCT and retrospective subgroups relative to plating. A meta-analysis of the functional scores or questionnaires was not possible because of the considerable variation among the included studies, and no significant differences were observed.\nEvidence suggests that both IM nailing and plating are appropriate treatments as IM nailing shows lower rate of delayed wound healing and superficial infection and plating may avoid malunion and knee pain. These findings should be interpreted with caution, however, because of the heterogeneity of the study designs. Large, rigorous RCTs are required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000079b","authors":["Zhi Mao","Guoqi Wang","Lihai Zhang","Licheng Zhang","Shuo Chen","Hailong Du","Yanpeng Zhao","Peifu Tang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13018-015-0217-5","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T19:23:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1749-799X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research","last_mentioned_on":1437284204,"links":["http:\/\/www.josr-online.com\/content\/10\/1\/95\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4481115\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.josr-online.com\/content\/pdf\/s13018-015-0217-5.pdf","pmid":"26078031","pubdate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Intramedullary nailing versus plating for distal tibia fractures without articular involvement: a meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intramedullary-nailing-versus-plating-distal-tibia-fractures-without-articular-involvement-metaanaly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5372803,"mean":6.2791140551991,"rank":2479250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2758917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5372803,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185805,"mean":8.5398206927732,"rank":85675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":93690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185805,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305,"mean":2.1960657894737,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.5557333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
