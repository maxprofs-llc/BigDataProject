Here we report that ablation of the mouse Tead4 gene results in a preimplantation lethal phenotype, and TEAD4 is one of two highly homologous TEAD transcription factors that are expressed during zygotic gene activation in mouse 2-cell embryos. Tead4(-\/-) embryos do not express trophectoderm-specific genes, such as Cdx2, but do express ICM-specific genes, such as Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1). Consequently, Tead4(-\/-) morulae do not produce trophoblast stem cells, trophectoderm or blastocoel cavities, and therefore do not implant into the uterine endometrium. However, Tead4(-\/-) embryos can produce embryonic stem cells, a derivative of ICM, and if the Tead4 allele is not disrupted until after implantation, then Tead4(-\/-) embryos complete development. Thus, Tead4 is the earliest gene shown to be uniquely required for specification of the trophectoderm lineage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Yagi, Rieko","Kohn, Matthew J","Karavanova, Irina","Kaneko, Kotaro J","Vullhorst, Detlef","DePamphilis, Melvin L","Buonanno, Andres","Rieko Yagi","Matthew J.
