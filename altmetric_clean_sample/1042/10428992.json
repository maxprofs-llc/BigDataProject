Liver failure occurred in 127 (64%) cases; of these 49 (39%) died. Maximum ingested daily paracetamol doses were above UK recommendations in 143 (72%) patients. US-Australasian thresholds for repeated supratherapeutic ingestions requiring intervention were not met in 71 (36%) cases, of these 35 (49%) developed liver failure and 10 (14%) died. No cases developing liver damage had paracetamol concentration <20\u2009mg\/L and a normal ALT\/AST on initial presentation or when RSPI was first suspected, but these values were only both available for 79 (40%) cases.\nSevere liver damage is reported after RSPI in adults and children, sometimes involving reported doses below current thresholds for intervention. Paracetamol concentrations <20\u2009mg\/L with normal serum ALT\/AST activity on initial assessment suggests a low risk of subsequent liver damage. These findings are, however, limited by low patient numbers, publication bias and the accuracy of the histories in reported cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243e","authors":["Acheampong, Paul","Thomas, Simon H.
