The parties choose beer or mixed drinks to consume exclusively throughout the evening at no cost. Unbeknownst to the subjects, the following conditions were manipulated across successive parties: (1) at the first party (64 males and 43 females) the beer alternative had standard alcohol content (i.e., 7% alcohol by volume), (2) at the second party (70 males and 48 females) the beer was a low-alcohol beer (3% alcohol) and (3) at the third party (53 males and 41 females) the partiers were randomly assigned to a regular alcohol content conditions of beer or mixed drinks or to a low-alcohol content condition (i.e., 3% beer or mixed drinks made with 7\/8-oz of distilled spirits). Since those assigned to the low-alcohol conditions did not consume more beverages than those in the regular alcohol conditions, a titration hypothesis was not supported and the exit BACs were significantly lower for partiers in the low-alcohol conditions. When females drank at the same rate as males, their exit BACs were significantly higher than those of males. Implications for DWI prevention are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f42","authors":["Geller, E S","Kalsher, M J","Clarke, S W"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-11T23:07:20+00:00","issns":["0096-882X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Studies on Alcohol","last_mentioned_on":1470953400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2046369"],"pmid":"2046369","pubdate":"1991-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Beer versus mixed-drink consumption at fraternity parties: a time and place for low-alcohol alternatives.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beer-versus-mixeddrink-consumption-fraternity-parties-time-place-lowalcohol-alternatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":1567653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6612910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257428,"mean":11.976387760413,"rank":64167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":192698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257428,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":4.6372568807339,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
