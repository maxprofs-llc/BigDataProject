Several atherosclerosis risk factors such as hyperglycemia and oxidized low-density lipoproteins, and immune injuries, such as antibodies and complement, induce endothelial cell apoptosis. While endothelial cell apoptosis is known to affect neighboring vascular wall cell biology, its consequences on macrophage reprogramming are ill defined. In this study, we report that apoptosis of human and mouse endothelial cells triggers the release of milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and reprograms macrophages into an anti-inflammatory cells. We demonstrated that MFG-E8 is released by apoptotic endothelial cells in a caspase-3-dependent manner. When macrophages were exposed to conditioned media from serum-starved apoptotic endothelial cells, they adopt a high anti-inflammatory, low pro-inflammatory cytokine\/chemokine secreting phenotype that is lost if MFG-E8 is absent from the media. Macrophage treatment with recombinant MFG-E8 recapitulates the effect of conditioned media. Finally, we showed that MFG-E8-mediated reprogramming of macrophages occurs through increased phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). Taken together, our study suggests a key role of MFG-E8 release from apoptotic endothelial cells in macrophage reprogramming and demonstrates the importance of the apoptotic microenvironment in anti-inflammatory macrophage responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E6368B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Brissette MJ","Lepage S","Lamonde AS","Sirois I","Groleau J","Laurin LP","Cailhier JF"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0036368","first_seen_on":"2012-05-11T15:40:09+00:00","issns":["","1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1337200573,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22558449?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036368"],"pmid":"22558449","pubdate":"2012-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"MFG-E8 Released by Apoptotic Endothelial Cells Triggers Anti-Inflammatory Macrophage Reprogramming","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mfge8-released-apoptotic-endothelial-cells-triggers-antiinflammatory-macrophage-reprogramming"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1971351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2517145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76463,"mean":4.5400484685203,"rank":26434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":49631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76463,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2965760979572,"rank":34076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":45583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3103,"mean":6.2014203739523,"rank":1298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":1784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3103,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
