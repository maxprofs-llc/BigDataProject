However, a large body of evidence now suggests that both IgE and mast cells are also key drivers of the long-term pathophysiological changes and tissue remodeling associated with chronic allergic inflammation in asthma and other settings. Such potential roles include IgE-dependent regulation of mast-cell functions, actions of IgE that are largely independent of mast cells and roles of mast cells that do not directly involve IgE. In this review, we discuss findings supporting the conclusion that IgE and mast cells can have both interdependent and independent roles in the complex immune responses that manifest clinically as asthma and other allergic disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","authors":["Stephen J Galli","Mindy Tsai","Galli SJ","Tsai M"],"doi":"10.1038\/nm.2755","endpage":"704","first_seen_on":"2012-05-12T03:59:13+00:00","funders":["niaid","nci"],"issns":["1078-8956","1546-170X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1490684400,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nm\/journal\/v18\/n5\/full\/nm.2755.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3597223\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3597223"],"pmid":"22561833","pubdate":"2012-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"693","subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"IgE and mast cells in allergic disease","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ige-mast-cells-allergic-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.93,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.93},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":633337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7792159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95582,"mean":5.4685192873061,"rank":6704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":88877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95582,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4454,"mean":27.450437457894,"rank":1381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":3073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4454,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":14.979333333333,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
