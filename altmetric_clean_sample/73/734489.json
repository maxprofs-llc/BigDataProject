Nail avulsion is a frequently undertaken, yet simple, intriguing procedure. It may either be surgical or chemical, using 40% urea. The former is most often undertaken using the distal approach. Nail avulsion may either be useful for diagnostic purposes like exploration of the nail bed, nail matrix and the nail folds and before contemplating a biopsy on the nail bed or for therapeutic purposes like onychocryptosis, warts, onychomycosis, chronic paronychia, nail tumors, matricectomy and retronychia. The procedure is carried out mostly under local anesthesia with or without epinephrine (1:2,00,000 dilution). Besides the above-mentioned indications, the contraindications and complications of nail avulsion are briefly outlined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aaa","doi":"10.4103\/0378-6323.95444","first_seen_on":"2012-05-09T10:27:02+00:00","issns":["0973-3922"],"issue":"3","journal":"Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology & Leprology","last_mentioned_on":1336558929,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22565429?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22565429","pubdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Nail avulsion: Indications and methods (surgical nail avulsion).","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nail-avulsion-indications-methods-surgical-nail-avulsion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":2900956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73513,"mean":4.2180941070845,"rank":52849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73513,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287,"mean":1.9945664335664,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AnestesiaF\/status\/200168773330796545","citation_ids":[734489],"posted_on":"2012-05-09T10:22:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
