It is estimated that in 2003 in the Netherlands at maximum 2553 new cancer cases (3.5% of all new cancer cases) were attributable to infection. This is considerably lower than globally (17.8%) and in developed countries in general (7.7%), as previously estimated by Parkin. Most likely the explanation is that the prevalence of infections in the Netherlands is lower. Infectious agents that cause the highest number of cancer cases in the Netherlands, as well as globally, are Helicobacter pylori (stomach cancer) and the human papilloma virus (mainly cervical cancer).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["van Lier EA","van Kranen HJ","van Vliet JA","Rahamat-Langendoen JC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2008.07.007","first_seen_on":"2012-05-09T12:17:36+00:00","issns":["0304-3835"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1336565286,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18752887"],"pmid":"18752887","pubdate":"2008-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ireland Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Estimated number of new cancer cases attributable to infection in the Netherlands in 2003.","type":"article","volume":"272","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estimated-number-new-cancer-cases-attributable-infection-netherlands-2003"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624910,"mean":4.93387576623,"rank":2694823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":921948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624910,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73455,"mean":4.2696085441228,"rank":46002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":27317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73455,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":2.1542511627907,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.55625,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1},"mendeley":{"NZ":1,"ES":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/IlonavdB\/status\/200195436169007104","rt":["RinkeNOS","matthijsvdberg"],"citation_ids":[734659],"posted_on":"2012-05-09T12:08:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Ilona van den Brink","url":"http:\/\/www.tudelft.nl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/658947144766922752\/GITk5sFV_normal.jpg","description":"Communicatieadviseur TU Delft - Robotica en AI.
