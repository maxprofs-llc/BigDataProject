By contrast, histidine exhibited no inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase activity. We characterized ergothioneine as a noncompetitive tyrosinase inhibitor using a Lineweaver-Burk plot of experimental kinetic data. The IC(50) value for ergothioneine scavenging of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl was 6.110\u2009\u00b1\u20090.305 mg\/ml, much higher than the IC(50) for inhibition of tyrosinase activity which indicating ergothioneine on tyrosinase shows a weak correlation to its antioxidative activity. The results demonstrated that ergothioneine has a potent inhibition effect on tyrosinase enzyme activity, resulting from the presence of the sulfur substituted imidazole ring in ergothioneine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a88","authors":["Liao WC","Wu WH","Tsai PC","Wang HF","Liu YH","Chan CF"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12010-011-9421-x","first_seen_on":"2012-05-10T12:30:20+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1336652703,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22068690?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22068690","pubdate":"2011-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Kinetics of Ergothioneine Inhibition of Mushroom Tyrosinase.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kinetics-ergothioneine-inhibition-mushroom-tyrosinase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":948357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76588,"mean":4.5886339195947,"rank":47846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76588,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":509,"mean":1.0944015748031,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":509,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.78214285714286,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
