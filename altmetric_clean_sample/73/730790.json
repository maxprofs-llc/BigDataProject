It has been shown previously that channels with high thresholds, when measured with the tripolar configuration, exhibit relatively broad psychophysical tuning curves. The elevated threshold and degraded spatial\/spectral selectivity of such channels are consistent with a poor electrode-neuron interface, defined as suboptimal electrode placement or reduced nerve survival. However, the psychophysical methods required to obtain these data are time intensive and may not be practical during a clinical mapping session, especially for young children. Here, we have extended the previous investigation to determine whether a physiological approach could provide a similar assessment of channel functionality. We hypothesized that, in accordance with the perceptual measures, higher EABR thresholds would correlate with steeper EABR amplitude growth functions, reflecting a degraded electrode-neuron interface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100058a1","doi":"10.1097\/aud.0b013e3181ff33ab","first_seen_on":"2012-05-07T01:45:24+00:00","issns":["0196-0202"],"issue":"4","journal":"Ear and hearing (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1361410454,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/Abstract\/2011\/07000\/Identifying_Cochlear_Implant_Channels_With_Poor.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ear-hearing\/2011\/07000\/Identifying_Cochlear_Implant_Channels_With_Poor.3.pdf","pmid":"21178633","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"436","subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Identifying Cochlear Implant Channels With Poor Electrode-Neuron Interfaces: Electrically Evoked Auditory Brain Stem Responses Measured With the Partial Tripolar Configuration","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identifying-cochlear-implant-channels-poor-electrodeneuron-interfaces-electrically-evoked-auditory-b"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":3380753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":776479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77126,"mean":4.775883980551,"rank":49089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":13139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77126,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":794,"mean":2.3693039092055,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":794,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.153125,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
