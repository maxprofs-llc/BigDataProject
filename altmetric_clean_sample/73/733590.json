In patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes, systemic GC concentrations seem to be invariably normal. Tissue GC concentrations determined by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and local cortisol (corticosterone in mice) regeneration from cortisone (11-dehydrocorticosterone in mice) by the 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2-HSD1) enzyme, principally expressed in the liver. Transgenic mice have demonstrated the importance of 11\u03b2-HSD1 in mediating aspects of the metabolic syndrome, as well as HPA axis control. In order to address the primacy of hepatic 11\u03b2-HSD1 in regulating metabolism and the HPA axis, we have generated liver-specific 11\u03b2-HSD1 knockout (LKO) mice, assessed biomarkers of GC metabolism, and examined responses to high-fat feeding. LKO mice were able to regenerate cortisol from cortisone to 40% of control and had no discernible difference in a urinary metabolite marker of 11\u03b2-HSD1 activity. Although circulating corticosterone was unaltered, adrenal size was increased, indicative of chronic HPA stimulation. There was a mild improvement in glucose tolerance but with insulin sensitivity largely unaffected. Adiposity and body weight were unaffected as were aspects of hepatic lipid homeostasis, triglyceride accumulation, and serum lipids. Additionally, no changes in the expression of genes involved in glucose or lipid homeostasis were observed. Liver-specific deletion of 11\u03b2-HSD1 reduces corticosterone regeneration and may be important for setting aspects of HPA axis tone, without impacting upon urinary steroid metabolite profile. These discordant data have significant implications for the use of these biomarkers of 11\u03b2-HSD1 activity in clinical studies. The paucity of metabolic abnormalities in LKO points to important compensatory effects by HPA activation and to a crucial role of extrahepatic 11\u03b2-HSD1 expression, highlighting the contribution of cross talk between GC target tissues in determining metabolic phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","doi":"10.1210\/en.2012-1019","first_seen_on":"2012-05-09T03:46:53+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc","mrc","dohuk"],"issns":["1945-7170"],"journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1336477633,"links":["http:\/\/endo.endojournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/05\/03\/en.2012-1019.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/endo.endojournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/05\/03\/en.2012-1019.full.pdf","pmid":"22555437","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Lack of Significant Metabolic Abnormalities in Mice with Liver-Specific Disruption of 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lack-significant-metabolic-abnormalities-mice-liverspecific-disruption-11hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2304910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1594059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76374,"mean":4.5999494847655,"rank":33588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":32074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76374,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2220,"mean":2.9409373591708,"rank":1041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2220,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
