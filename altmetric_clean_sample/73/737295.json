Mass spectrometry, on the other hand, is able to separate constituents of the solution based on their mass, but methods to probe the structure of each constituent are needed. Here, we explored whether gas-phase UV spectroscopy can give an indication of DNA folding in ions isolated by electrospray mass spectrometry. Model DNA single strands, duplexes, and G-quadruplexes were extracted from solution by electrospray; the anions were stored in a quadrupole ion trap and irradiated by a tunable laser to obtain the UV action spectra of each complex. We found that the duplex and quadruplex spectra are significantly different from the spectra of single strands, thereby suggesting that electronic spectroscopy can be used to probe the DNA gas-phase structure and obtain information about the intrinsic properties of high-order DNA structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","doi":"10.1021\/jp302468x","first_seen_on":"2012-05-10T16:55:31+00:00","issns":["1520-5215"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1336955585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22568521"],"pmid":"22568521","pubdate":"2012-05-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
