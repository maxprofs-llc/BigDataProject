Previous animal experiments suggest significant contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) improvements, but these studies have not yet been performed in humans due to the lack of availability of a suitable agent. Here we report the use of the USPIO ferumoxytol (AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA) for functional brain activation in humans, termed contrast enhanced functional blood volume imaging (CE-fBVI). Four subjects were scanned during a unilateral finger tapping task with standard blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging before contrast and CE-fBVI after contrast injection. The CE-fBVI response showed both a fast (5.8\u00b11.3 s) and a slow (75.3\u00b127.5 s) component of CBV response to stimuli. A significant CNR gain of approximately 2-3 was found for CE-fBVI compared to BOLD fMRI. Interestingly, less susceptibility-related signal dropouts were observed in the inferior frontal and temporal lobes with CE-fBVI. The combination of higher CNR and better spatial specificity, enabled by CE-fBVI using blood pool USPIO contrast agent opens the door to higher resolution brain mapping.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Deqiang Qiu","Greg Zaharchuk","Thomas Christen","Wendy W.
