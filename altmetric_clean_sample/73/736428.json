Treatment of endometriosis involves conservative or radical surgery, or medical therapies. The goals for endometriosis treatment may be the relief of pain and\/or a successful pregnancy achievement in infertile patients. Treatment must be individualized with a multidisciplinary approach. The classical treatments carry adverse side effects and in some cases a negative impact on quality of life. New agents promise a distinct perspective in endometriosis treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c5","authors":["Ana Luiza L Rocha","Fernando M Reis","Felice Petraglia"],"doi":"10.1517\/13543784.2012.683783","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2012-05-10T11:01:05+00:00","issns":["1354-3784","1744-7658"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1337691192,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543784.2012.683783"],"pmid":"22568855","pubdate":"2012-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"New trends for the medical treatment of endometriosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-trends-medical-treatment-endometriosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1873184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3145552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78922,"mean":4.8327274616389,"rank":21187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":57414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78922,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":2.0657138314785,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.936,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
