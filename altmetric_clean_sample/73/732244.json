Here we demonstrate that the Kindlin-binding site in the \u03b21-integrin cytoplasmic domain serves as a molecular switch enabling the sequential binding of two FERM-domain-containing proteins in different cellular compartments. When \u03b21 integrins are at the plasma membrane, Kindlins control ligand-binding affinity. However, when they are internalized, Kindlins dissociate from integrins and sorting nexin 17 (SNX17) is recruited to free \u03b21-integrin tails in early endosomes to prevent \u03b21-integrin degradation, leading to their recycling back to the cell surface. Our results identify SNX17 as a \u03b21-integrin-tail-binding protein that interacts with the free Kindlin-binding site in endosomes to stabilize \u03b21 integrins, resulting in their recycling to the cell surface where they can be reused.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","authors":["Ralph Thomas B\u00c3\u00b6ttcher","Christopher Stremmel","Alexander Meves","Hannelore Meyer","Moritz Widmaier","Hui-Yuan Tseng","Reinhard Fssler"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncb2501","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-05-09T00:31:43+00:00","issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1339027200,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncb\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ncb2501.html"],"pmid":"22561348","pubdate":"2012-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Sorting nexin 17 prevents lysosomal degradation of [beta]1 integrins by binding to the [beta]1-integrin tail","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sorting-nexin-17-prevents-lysosomal-degradation-%CE%B21-integrins-binding-%CE%B21integrin-tail"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1785779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2639740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76373,"mean":4.5937331220866,"rank":22999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":51799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76373,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2131,"mean":6.5685906103286,"rank":1172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2131,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":2.8849056603774,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Ph.
