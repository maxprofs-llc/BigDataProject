The successful lithographic application of block copolymers relies on three critical conditions being met: high Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (\u03c7), which enable formation of <10 nm features, etch selectivity between blocks for facile pattern transfer, and thin film self-assembly control. The present paper describes the synthesis and self-assembly of block copolymers composed of naturally derived oligosaccharides coupled to a silicon-containing polystyrene derivative synthesized by activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization. The block copolymers have a large \u03c7 and a low degree of polymerization (N) enabling formation of 5 nm feature diameters, incorporate silicon in one block for oxygen reactive ion etch contrast, and exhibit bulk and thin film self-assembly of hexagonally packed cylinders facilitated by a combination of spin coating and solvent annealing techniques. As observed by small angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy, these materials exhibit some of the smallest block copolymer features in the bulk and in thin films reported to date.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Julia D.
