The present study has focussed on S100 proteins as a potentially promising group of markers in cancer development and progression. One reason of interest in this family of proteins is because the majority of the S100 genes are clustered on a region of human chromosome 1q21 that is prone to genomic rearrangements. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that S100 proteins are often up-regulated in many cancers, including breast, and this is frequently associated with tumour progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Patrizia Cancemi","Patrizia Cancemi","Gianluca Di Cara","Nadia Ninfa Albanese","Francesca Costantini","Maria Rita Marabeti","Rosa Musso","Carmelo Lupo","Elena Roz","Ida Pucci-Minafra"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2407-10-476","first_seen_on":"2012-05-10T13:12:06+00:00","issns":["","1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1283563690,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/10\/476"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmccancer\/content\/pdf\/1471-2407-10-476.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2944176","pmid":"20815901","pubdate":"2010-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"476","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Large-scale proteomic identification of S100 proteins in breast cancer tissues","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-proteomic-identification-s100-proteins-breast-cancer-tissues-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9199904968162,"rank":2897586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73727,"mean":4.2097574261454,"rank":52965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73727,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1788,"mean":2.5649278119754,"rank":1359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":0.974,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
