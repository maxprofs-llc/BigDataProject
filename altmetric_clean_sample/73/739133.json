This was a case-control study to determine the prevalence of maternal obesity in early pregnancy and compare the subsequent pregnancy outcome between 201 women with obesity and 201 non-obese controls in a University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. The prevalence of obesity in early pregnancy was 9.63%. Obesity was significantly associated with advanced maternal age and parity > or =1. It was also a risk factor for pregnancy induced hypertension, admissions during pregnancy, caesarean delivery and associated with 5th minute apgar score < or =3 (0.044). Obesity in early pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome among pregnant Nigerian women. This information should be utilised by physicians to improve the outcome of pregnancy and promote safe motherhood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068fa","first_seen_on":"2012-05-11T15:29:34+00:00","issns":["1118-4841"],"issue":"4","journal":"African Journal Of Reproductive Health","last_mentioned_on":1336749658,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22571106?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22571106","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Maternal obesity in early pregnancy and subsequent pregnancy outcome in a Nigerian population.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-obesity-early-pregnancy-subsequent-pregnancy-outcome-nigerian-population-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2306894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1589160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76464,"mean":4.5795337091142,"rank":33634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":32023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76464,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.0498536585366,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.02,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
