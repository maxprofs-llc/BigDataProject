In humans, skin synthesis following exposure to UVB is a potent source of vitamin D, but in regions with low UVB, individuals are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and to investigate determinants of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations in a high northern latitude country. Detailed dietary, lifestyle, and demographic data were collected for 2235 healthy adults (21-82 y) from Scotland. Plasma 25-OHD was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem MS. Among study participants, 34.5% were severely deficient (25-OHD <25 nmol\/L) and 28.9% were at high risk of deficiency (25-40 nmol\/L). Only 36.6% of participants were at low risk of vitamin D deficiency or had adequate levels (>40 nmol\/L). Among participants who were taking supplements, 21.3% had a May-standardized 25-OHD concentration >50 nmol\/L, 54.2% had 25-50 nmol\/L, and 24.5% had <25 nmol\/L, whereas this was 15.6, 43.3, and 41%, respectively, among those who did not take supplements (P < 0.0001). The most important sources of vitamin D were supplements and fish consumption. Vitamin D deficiency in Scotland is highly prevalent due to a combination of insufficient exposure to UVB and insufficient dietary intake. Higher dietary vitamin D intake modestly improved the plasma 25-OHD concentration (P = 0.02) and reduced the proportion of severely deficient individuals (P < 0.0001). In regions with low UVB exposure, dietary and supplement intake may be much more important than previously thought and consideration should be given to increasing the current recommended dietary allowance of 0-10 \u03bcg\/d for adults in Scotland.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Lina Zgaga","Evropi Theodoratou","Susan M.
