Although morphologic features, especially tumor nuclear morphology, are important for cancer grading, little research has been reported on quantitatively correlating cellular morphology with chemotherapy response, especially in a large data set. In this study, we have used a large population of patients to identify molecular and morphologic signatures associated with chemotherapy response in serous ovarian carcinoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E6383L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuexin Liu","Yan Sun","Russell Broaddus","Jinsong Liu","Anil K.
