Single-crystal X-ray studies reveal that three eight-coordinated Dy(III) centers in a square antiprismatic coordination environment are connecting to a central octahedral trivalent Fe or Co ion forming a propeller-type complex. The dynamics of the magnetization in the two isostructural compounds, modulated by the nature of the central M(III) metal ion, are remarkably different despite their analogous direct current (dc) magnetic properties. The slow relaxation of the magnetization observed for 2 mainly originates from isolated Dy ions, since a diamagnetic Co(III) metal ion links the magnetic Dy(III) ions. In the case of 1, the magnetic interaction between S = 1\/2 Fe(III) ion and the three Dy(III) magnetic centers, although weak, generates a complex energy spectrum of magnetic states with low-lying excited states that induce a smaller energy gap than for 2 and thus a faster relaxation of the magnetization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Gong-Feng Xu","Patrick Gamez","Jinkui Tang","Rodolphe Cl\u00e9rac","Yun-Nan Guo","Yang Guo"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300126q","first_seen_on":"2012-05-07T23:49:02+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1336434182,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic300126q"],"pmid":"22563719","pubdate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120507141924001","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              M\n              \n              Dy\n              \n              \n              (M = Fe\n              \n              , Co\n              \n              ) Complexes: Three-Blade Propellers Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetization\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/m-iiidy-iii3-m-fe-iii-co-iii-complexes-threeblade-propellers-exhibiting-slow-relaxation-magnetizatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3555086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76133,"mean":4.5703379656386,"rank":60615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76133,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.4086585528509,"rank":4181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":0.71150306748466,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
