We here present a van der Waals density functional study of the desorption barrier energy of the ten smallest n-alkanes (of carbon chain length N = 1-10) from graphene. We find linear scaling with N, including a non-zero intercept with the energy axis, i.e. an offset at the extrapolation to N = 0. This calculated offset is quantitatively similar to the results of the TPD measurements. From further calculations of the polyethylene polymer we offer a suggestion for the origin of the offset.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012JPCM...24P4212L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df0","arxiv_id":"1205.1295","authors":["Elisa Londero","Emma K.
