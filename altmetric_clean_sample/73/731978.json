Some specific factors, such as TGF-\u03b2, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and B7 costimulatory molecules have been identified as essentials for maintenance of the peripheral Treg compartment. Conversely, Treg dependency upon classical T cell homeostatic factors such as IL-7 is still unclear. In this work, we formally investigated the role of IL-7 in Treg homeostasis in vivo in murine models. We demonstrated that IL-7 availability regulated the size of peripheral Treg cell pool and thus paralleled the impact of IL-7 on conventional T cell pool. Moreover, we showed that IL-7 administration increased Treg cell numbers by inducing thymic-independent Treg peripheral expansion. Importantly the impact of IL-7 on Treg expansion was detected whether conventional T cells were present or absent as IL-7 directly participates to the peripheral expansion of Treg after adoptive transfer into lymphopenic hosts. Our results definitively identify IL-7 as a central factor contributing to Treg peripheral homeostasis, thus reassembling Treg to other T cell subsets in respect of their need for IL-7 for their peripheral maintenance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E6596S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Federico Simonetta","Nicolas Gestermann","Kim Zita Martinet","Michele Boniotto","Pierre Tissi\u00e8res","Benedict Seddon","Christine Bourgeois"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0036596","first_seen_on":"2012-05-07T21:24:38+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"5","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1336428413,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036596?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0036596.pdf","pmid":"22586481","pubdate":"2012-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e36596","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Interleukin-7 Influences FOXP3+CD4+ Regulatory T Cells Peripheral Homeostasis","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin7-influences-foxp3cd4-regulatory-t-cells-peripheral-homeostasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992147,"mean":6.7405564850737,"rank":3902661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4027122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992147,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94065,"mean":5.1944830966151,"rank":40427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":52710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94065,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112181,"mean":10.352625797825,"rank":58132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":52910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112181,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2900,"mean":8.0136405657123,"rank":1532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2900,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
