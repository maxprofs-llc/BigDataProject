The alveolar bone in jaws originates from neural crest cells and possesses significant site- and age-related properties. However, such intrinsic characteristics of BMSCs from alveolar bone (AB-BMSCs) and the underlying regulatory mechanisms still remain unknown. Here, we found that the expression of special AT-rich binding protein 2 (SATB2) in human AB-BMSCs significantly decreased with aging. SATB2 knockdown on AB-BMSCs from young donors displayed these aging-related phenotypes in vitro. Meanwhile, enforced SATB2 overexpression could rejuvenate AB-BMSCs from older donors. Importantly, satb2 gene- modified BMSCs therapy could prevent the alveolar bone loss during the aging of rats. Mechanistically, the stemness regulator Nanog was identified as the direct transcriptional target of SATB2 in BMSCs and functioned as a downstream mediator of SATB2. Collectively, our data reveal that SATB2 in AB-BMSCs associates with their age-related properties, and prevents AB-BMSCs senescence via maintaining Nanog expression. These findings highlight the translational potential of transcriptional factor-based cellular reprogramming for anti-aging therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbbe","authors":["Zhou, Peipei","Wu, Geng","Zhang, Ping","Xu, Rongyao","Ge, Jie","Fu, Yu","Zhang, Yuchao","Du, Yifei","Ye, Jinhai","Cheng, Jie","Jiang, Hongbing"],"doi":"10.18632\/aging.101041","first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T10:09:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-4589"],"issue":"9","journal":"Aging","last_mentioned_on":1474052983,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27632702?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27632702","http:\/\/www.aging-us.com\/article\/thEpANanhQ93HsYZL\/text"],"pmid":"27632702","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"SATB2-Nanog axis links age-related intrinsic changes of mesenchymal stem cells from craniofacial bone","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/satb2nanog-axis-links-agerelated-intrinsic-changes-mesenchymal-stem-cells-craniofacial-bone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":3983047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4220397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233813,"mean":12.848935572169,"rank":110427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":116351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233813,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":14.487037433155,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":26.33647761194,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/776724659299454976","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12029525],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T10:09:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":56},"tweet_id":"776724659299454976"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Mechanisms_bot\/statuses\/776860636085035008","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12029525],"posted_on":"2016-09-16T19:09:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Mechanisms_bot","url":"http:\/\/www.trailofpapers.net\/2016\/01\/introducing-mechanisms-twitter-bot.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687842776122179584\/JGkpqdir_normal.png","description":"Tweeting out all the mechanisms we don't understand.","id_on_source":"Mechanisms_bot","tweeter_id":"4721692920","geo":{"lt":47.60621,"ln":-122.33207,"country":"US"},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"776860636085035008"}]}}
