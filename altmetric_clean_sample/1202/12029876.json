Because few investigations focus on this disease, the demographics and clinicopathological features of glomerulonephritis related to staphylococcal infection are not well characterized.We conducted a pooled analysis of published literature in electronic databases and analyzed the clinical features, laboratory findings, and histopathological changes. The patients were divided into 4 groups based on their prognosis: remission, persistent renal dysfunction, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or death. A logistic regression model was used to identify the determinants of disease outcome.A total of 83 (64 men) patients with glomerulonephritis related to staphylococcal infection from 31 reports were analyzed. The mean age was 58 years (58\u200a\u00b1\u200a17). Majority of the reports originated from Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. Clinical characteristics of the cases were hematuria (82\/83), proteinuria (78\/83), and acute kidney injury (75\/83). Visceral abscesses (26\/83) and skin infections (24\/83) were the common sites of infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen. The dominant or codominant deposition of IgA or C3 along the glomeruli was an important feature identified by immunofluorescence. There were 19 patients (22.9%) that progressed to dialysis-dependent ESRD. Twelve patients (14.5%) died. A univariate regression analysis indicated that diabetes mellitus (DM) (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-8.48; P\u200a=\u200a0.04) and age (OR 4.80; 95% CI 1.84-12.53; P\u200a=\u200a0.001) were risk factors for ESRD or death. A multivariate regression analysis also revealed that age (OR 4.90; 95% CI 1.82-13.18; P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and DM (OR 3.07; 95% CI 0.98-9.59; P\u200a=\u200a0.05) were independent risk factors for unfavorable prognosis.Glomerulonephritis related to staphylococcal infection has different features than typical postinfectious glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis of glomerulonephritis related to staphylococcal infection relies on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy findings. Age and DM are independent risk factors of poor prognosis for glomerulonephritis related to staphylococcal infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Wang, Si-Yang","Bu, Ru","Zhang, Qi","Liang, Shuang","Wu, Jie","Liu, Xue-Guang Zhang Shu-Wen","Cai, Guang-Yan","Chen, Xiang-Mei"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000003386","first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T10:25:02+00:00","issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"15","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1474021488,"links":["http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/_layouts\/15\/oaks.journals.mobile\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=04120&article=00072#ath","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=04120&article=00072&type=abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2016\/04120\/Clinical,_Pathological,_and_Prognostic.72.pdf","pmid":"27082609","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e3386","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Clinical, Pathological, and Prognostic Characteristics of Glomerulonephritis Related to Staphylococcal Infection","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/mobile.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2016\/04120\/Clinical,_Pathological,_and_Prognostic.72.aspx","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-pathological-prognostic-characteristics-glomerulonephritis-related-staphylococcal-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":6366902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1137614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233814,"mean":12.849233250503,"rank":165547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233814,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4222,"mean":2.9456687988628,"rank":2609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4222,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":5.5141382978723,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
