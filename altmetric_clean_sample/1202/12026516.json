We aimed to determine the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in adult women and the differences in associated factors among women of reproductive age and older women. In addition, to determine whether distinct subgroups existed among CPP cases.\nA cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among 5300 randomly selected women aged \u226525\u00a0years resident in the Grampian region, UK. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine pregnancy-related and psychosocial factors associated with CPP. To identify subgroups of CPP cases, we performed cluster analysis using variables of pain severity, psychosocial factors and pain coping strategies.\nOf 2088 participants, 309 (14.8%) reported CPP. CPP was significantly associated with being of reproductive age (odds ratios (OR) 2.43, 95% CI 1.69-3.48), multiple non-pain somatic symptoms (OR 3.58 95% CI 2.23-5.75), having fatigue (OR mild 1.74 95% CI 1.24-2.44, moderate\/severe 1.82, 95% CI 1.25-2.63) and having depression (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.09-2.38). CPP was less associated with multiple non-pain somatic symptoms in women of reproductive age compared to older women (interaction OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.92). We identified two clusters of CPP cases; those having little\/no psychosocial distress and those having high psychosocial distress.\nCPP is common in both age groups, though women of reproductive age are more likely to report it. Heightened somatic awareness may be more strongly associated with CPP in older women. There are distinct groups of CPP cases characterized by the absence\/presence of psychosocial distress.\nHeightened somatic awareness may be more strongly associated with CPP in women of post-reproductive years compared to women of reproductive years. Two subgroups of CPP cases can be differentiated by the absence\/presence of psychosocial distress suggesting that stratified management approach may be more efficient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058cc","authors":["Ayorinde, A.A.","Bhattacharya, S.","Druce, K.L.","Jones, G.T.","Macfarlane, G.J.","Ayorinde, A A","Bhattacharya, S","Druce, K L","Jones, G T","Macfarlane, G J","A.A.
