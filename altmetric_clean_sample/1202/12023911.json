Cognitive impairment has been associated with diabetes, worsening quality of life in patients. The structural and functional interaction of neurons with the surrounding vasculature is critical for proper function of the central nervous system including domains involved in learning and memory. Thus, in this review we explore cognitive impairment in patients and experimental models, focusing on links to vascular dysfunction and structural changes. Lastly, we propose a role for the innate immunity-mediated inflammation in neurovascular changes in diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000257b","authors":["Trevor Hardigan","Rebecca Ward","Adviye Ergul","Hardigan, Trevor","Ward, Rebecca","Ergul, Adviye"],"doi":"10.1042\/cs20160397","endpage":"1822","first_seen_on":"2016-09-16T00:19:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-8736","0143-5221"],"issue":"20","journal":"Clinical Science","last_mentioned_on":1474650943,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinsci.org\/content\/130\/20\/1807.large.jpg?rss=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27634842?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.clinsci.org\/content\/130\/20\/1807?utm_content=buffer061aa&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27634842"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinsci.org\/content\/ppclinsci\/130\/20\/1807.full.pdf","pmid":"27634842","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Portland Press Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1807","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Cerebrovascular complications of diabetes: focus on cognitive dysfunction","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebrovascular-complications-diabetes-focus-cognitive-dysfunction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":845172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7569968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234088,"mean":12.858205829456,"rank":36606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":197031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234088,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":951,"mean":4.3739094736842,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":951,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":7.1303225806452,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
