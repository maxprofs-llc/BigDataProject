In both sub-studies, patients were randomised in a double-blind, parallel-group design to receive eight weekly intravenous infusions of EPO (Eprex; 40,000 IU\/ml) or saline (0.9% NaCl). Plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and high sensitive c-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at week 1 (baseline) and weeks 5, 9 and 14. HDRS-17 and neuropsychological function was assessed at weeks 1, 9 and 14 using a test battery including the RAVLT Auditory Verbal Learning Test (primary depression and primary cognition outcomes in the original trial).\nEPO had no cumulative effect on plasma levels of IL-6 or IL-18 but increased hsCRP levels in patients with TRD (mean\u00b1SD change in ng\/L: EPO: 0.43\u00b11.64; Saline: -0.90\u00b12.43; F(1,39)=4.78, p=0.04). EPO had no effects on inflammatory markers in BD. There was no correlation between change in inflammatory markers and change in verbal memory.\nRepeated EPO infusions had no effect on IL-6 and IL-18 levels but produced a modest increase in hsCRP levels in patients with TRD. Changes over time in inflammatory markers were not correlated with changes in cognition suggesting that modulation of the inflammatory pathway is not a putative mechanism of the EPO-associated improvement of cognition in affective disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242d","authors":["Maj Vinberg","Pia Weikop","Niels Vidiendal Olsen","Lars Vedel Kessing","Kamilla Miskowiak","Vinberg, Maj","Weikop, Pia","Olsen, Niels Vidiendal","Kessing, Lars Vedel","Miskowiak, Kamilla"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbi.2016.05.006","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T20:37:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["08891591","1090-2139"],"journal":"Brain, Behavior & Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1463601815,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0889159116301143&_version=1&md5=bb3b0437e2ce675eba4c320598b2ab04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27181179?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27181179","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","brain","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Effect of recombinant erythropoietin on inflammatory markers in patients with affective disorders: a randomised controlled study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-recombinant-erythropoietin-inflammatory-markers-patients-affective-disorders-randomised-contr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":3997491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2169546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268401,"mean":11.433013368107,"rank":145752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268401,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1320,"mean":8.9538908263836,"rank":809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1320,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":6.8665106382979,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
