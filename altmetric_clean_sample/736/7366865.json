CRP values were determined using commercial kits from Roche Diagnostics Ltd, and MS criteria were analyzed according to National Cholesterol Education Program's - Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP\/ATP III).\nA total of 88 individuals had MS, and 77.3% (n=68) of these showed alterations of us-CRP (P=0.0001, confidence interval [CI] 0.11-0.34). Individuals with MS had higher mean values of us-CRP in global measures (P=0.0001) and stratified by sex (P=0.004) than individuals without the syndrome. This marker exhibited significant differences with varying criteria for MS, such as waist circumference (P=0.0001), triglycerides (P=0.002), and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.007), and the highest levels of us-CRP were found in individuals with more MS criteria.\nus-CRP was strongly associated with the presence of MS and MS criteria in this group of workers. us-CRP is a useful and effective marker for identifying the development of MS and may be used as a reference in routine care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007102","authors":["Luciane Bresciani Salaroli","Monica Cattafesta","Nazar\u00e9 Souza Bissoli"],"doi":"10.2147\/dmso.s101283","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T20:59:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-7007"],"journal":"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1463084940,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/metabolic-syndrome-and-c-reactive-protein-in-bank-employees-peer-reviewed-article-DMSO"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=30302","pmcid":"PMC4869671","pmid":"27274294","pubdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"137","title":"Metabolic syndrome and C-reactive protein in bank employees","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-syndrome-creactive-protein-bank-employees-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268158,"mean":11.427982689245,"rank":224060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268158,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197,"mean":10.141836734694,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.025,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
