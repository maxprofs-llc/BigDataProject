Sustained and increased inflammation is a common feature of UAD, which is inevitably accompanied with marked gene modification and tight gene regulation. However, gene regulation in the common inflammatory processes in UAD remains unclear. MicroRNA (miRNA), a novel regulator of gene expression, has been considered to be involved in many inflammatory diseases. Although there are an increasing number of studies of miRNAs in inflammatory upper and lower airway diseases, few miRNAs have been identified that directly link the upper and lower airways. In this article, therefore, we reviewed the relevant studies available in order to improve the understanding of the roles of miRNAs in the interaction and pathogenesis of UAD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Zheng Liu"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17050716","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T22:36:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1463091135,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/5\/716?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/5\/716\/pdf","pmid":"27187364","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"716","title":"MicroRNA in United Airway Diseases","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna-united-airway-diseases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268158,"mean":11.427967213237,"rank":224060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268158,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4777,"mean":2.24405360134,"rank":3491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4777,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":2.1622895442359,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
