CTC mixing ratios have been thoroughly studied since its restriction under the Montreal Protocol, mostly in remote areas with the aim of reporting long-term trends after its banning. The observed decrease of the CTC background mixing ratio, however, was not as strong as expected. In order to explain this behavior CTC lifetime should be adjusted by estimating the relative significance of its sinks and by identifying ongoing potential sources. Looking for possible sources, CTC was measured with high-time resolution in two sites in Northern Spain, using auto-GC systems and specifically developed acquisition and processing methodologies. The first site, Bilbao, is an urban area influenced by the surrounding industry, where measurements were performed with GC-MSD for a one-year period (2007-2008). The second site, at Valderejo Natural Park (VNP), is a rural background area where measurements were carried out with GC-FID and covering CTC data a nonsuccessive five-year period (2003-2005, 2010-2011, and 2014-2015years). Median yearly CTC mixing ratios were slightly higher in the urban area (120pptv) than in VNP (80-100pptv). CTC was reported to be well mixed in the atmosphere and no sources were noticed to impact the rural site. The observed long-term trend in VNP was in agreement with the estimated global CTC emissions. In the urban site, apart from industrial and commercial CTC sources, chlorine-bleach products used as cleaning agents were reported as promotors of indoor sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","authors":["de Blas, Maite","Uria-Tellaetxe, Iratxe","Gomez, Maria Carmen","Navazo, Marino","Alonso, Lucio","Garc\u00eda, Jose Antonio","Durana, Nieves","Iza, Jon","Ram\u00f3n, Jarol Derley"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.03.177","endpage":"34","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T15:32:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1026","00489697"],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1474449676,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0048969716306003","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2016.03.177"],"pmid":"27092418","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Atmospheric carbon tetrachloride in rural background and industry surrounded urban areas in Northern Iberian Peninsula: Mixing ratios, trends, and potential sources","type":"article","volume":"562","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atmospheric-carbon-tetrachloride-rural-background-industry-surrounded-urban-areas-northern-iberian-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":928522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7473553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273192,"mean":11.624673536097,"rank":43224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":229122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273192,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5454,"mean":5.0684900055016,"rank":507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5454,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":5.3089192546584,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
