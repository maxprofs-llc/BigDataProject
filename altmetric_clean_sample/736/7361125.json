Several selective modifications of the structure of these derivatives and mainly of thiazoyl phosphines are detailed, thus illustrating the great possibilities to tailor at will their structures and therefore their properties. The formation of Ru and Au complexes is reported. Six of these new thiazoyl phosphines were characterized by X-ray crystallography as well as two of their gold complexes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Maria Zablocka","Gennady Oshovsky","Carine Duhayon","Sonia Ladeira","Anne-Marie Caminade","Serge Mignani","Jean-Pierre Majoral"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt01106c","endpage":"9703","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T13:51:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"23","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463061044,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT01106C?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt01106c","pmid":"27226030","pubdate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9695","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Thiazoyl Phosphines.
