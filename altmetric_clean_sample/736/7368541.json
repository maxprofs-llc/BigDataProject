Mild-to-moderate asthma often responds to traditional medications, whereas severe disease can be refractory to inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting \u03b2-agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. There is robust research into the variable phenotypes of asthma. Biomarkers help define the specific pathophysiology of different asthma phenotypes and identify potential therapeutic targets. The following review will discuss the current use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of asthma, triaging the severity of a patient's disease, and the potential efficacy of treatments. This information can be used to define certain patient populations that are more likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroids or biologics. As knowledge of patient phenotypes and endotypes and biological agents to target specific classes of asthma emerge, the ability to provide personalized care to asthmatic patients will follow.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Alalia Berry","William W.
