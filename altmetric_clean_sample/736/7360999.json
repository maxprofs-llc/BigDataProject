In the bio-printing process, cells are subject to process-induced forces (such as shear force) that can result in cell damage and loss of cell function. The flow behavior of the biomaterial solutions that encapsulate living cells in this process plays an important role. This study used a rheometer to examine the flow behavior of alginate solution and alginate-Schwann cell (RSC96), alginate-fibroblast cell (NIH-3T3), and alginate-skeletal muscle cell (L8) suspensions during shearing with respect to effects on cell viability and proliferation. The flow behavior of all of the alginate-cell suspensions varied with alginate concentration and cell density, and had a significant influence on the viability and proliferation of the cells once sheared as well as on the recovery of the sheared cells. These findings provide a mean to preserve cell viability and\/or retain cell proliferation function in the bio-printing process by regulating the flow behavior of cell-biomaterial suspensions and process parameters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b99","authors":["Ning, Liqun","Guillemot, Arthur","Zhao, Jingxuan","Kipouros, Georges","Chen, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tec.2016.0011","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T13:39:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1937-3392","1937-3384"],"journal":"Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods","last_mentioned_on":1463060324,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27166436"],"pmid":"27166436","pubdate":"2016-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Influence of flow behavior of alginate-cell suspensions on cell viability and proliferation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-flow-behavior-alginatecell-suspensions-cell-viability-proliferation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268158,"mean":11.428088410893,"rank":224067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268158,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228,"mean":6.0863612334802,"rank":163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.8611111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
