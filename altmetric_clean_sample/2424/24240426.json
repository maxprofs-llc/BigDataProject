Currently, trauma-induced coagulopathy is seen as an independent disease entity influencing survival. Severely bleeding trauma patients are often treated with classical blood products in predefined ratios (damage control resuscitation). Viscoelasticity-based and target-oriented approaches could possibly be given priority. Viscoelasticity-based diagnostics and therapy enable the qualitative investigation of whole blood and provide therapeutically usable information on initiation, dynamics and sustainability of thrombus formation. Due to the ease of handling and timely results this lends itself as a point-of-care procedure. This article presents the clinical issues with using viscoelastic procedures and current expert recommendations taking the literature into consideration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c2a","authors":["Marc Maegele","Michael Caspers","Herbert Sch\u00f6chl"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00113-017-0397-z","first_seen_on":"2017-08-23T23:28:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0177-5537","1433-044X"],"journal":"Der Unfallchirurg","last_mentioned_on":1503411256,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00113-017-0397-z"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00113-017-0397-z.pdf","pmid":"28831518","pubdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Medizin","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Viskoelastizit\u00e4tsbasierte Therapie beim blutenden Schwerverletzten","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167253,"mean":12.721998290005,"rank":137089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167253,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":1.1141061452514,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.25806451612903,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Viskoelastizit\u00e4tsbasierte Therapie beim blutenden SchwerverletztenViscoelasticity-based treatment of bleeding injuries","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=485871418454309&id=162364480805006","license":"public","citation_ids":[24240426],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T14:14:16+00:00","summary":"\u00a0","author":{"name":"Handchirurgie","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/162364480805006","facebook_wall_name":"Handchirurgie","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/162364480805006\/picture","id_on_source":"162364480805006"}}]}}
