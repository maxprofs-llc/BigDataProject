No studies have prospectively examined the influence of ACL injury and reconstruction on lower extremity muscle volumes.\nAssess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived lower extremity muscle volumes, and quantify quadriceps strength and activation in patients following ACL injury and reconstruction.\nProspective case series.\nResearch laboratory and MRI facility. Patients (or Other Participants): Four patients (2 males, 2 females, age=27.4\u00b17.4, height=169.2\u00b18.1cm, mass=74.3\u00b118.5kg) scheduled for ACL-R.\n35 muscle volumes were obtained from a bilateral lower extremity MRI before and after ACL-R.\nMuscle volumes expressed relative to (1) a normative database pre-and-post-surgery, (2) limb symmetry pre-and-post-surgery, and (3) percentage change pre-to-post-surgery. Quadriceps function was quantified by normalized knee extension maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) torque and central activation ratio (CAR).\nInvolved vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior were consistently smaller than healthy individuals (Z< -1SD) pre-and-post-surgery in all patients. Involved rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were more than 15% smaller than the contralateral limb pre-surgery, whereas the involved rectus femoris, gracilis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis muscle volumes exceeded 20% asymmetry post-operatively. Involved gracilis and semitendinosus atrophied more than 30% from pre-to-post-surgery. Involved MVIC torque and CAR increased by 12.7% and 12.5% respectively, yet strength remained 33.2% asymmetric post-surgery.\nAdaptations in lower extremity muscle volumes are present following ACL injury and reconstruction. Anterior thigh and shank muscles were smaller than healthy individuals, and large asymmetries in quadriceps volumes were observed pre- and post-surgery. Selective atrophy of the semitendinosus and gracilis occurred following surgery. Volumetric deficits of the quadriceps musculature may exist despite improvements in muscle strength and activation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f37","authors":["Grant E.
