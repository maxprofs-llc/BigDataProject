For this task, several analytical techniques as well as microbiology are required. In this work, the antimicrobial properties of benzyl isothiocyanate, allyl isothiocyanate and essential oils of cinnamon and oregano against several moulds and bacteria have been evaluated. Benzyl isothiocyanate showed the highest antimicrobial activity and it was selected for developing the new active packaging material. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were successfully used to demonstrate the mode of action of benzyl isothiocyanate on Escherichia coli. Bacteria exhibited external modifications such as oval shape and the presence of septum surface, but they did not show any disruption or membrane damage. To provide data on the in vitro action of benzyl isothiocyanate and the presence of inhibition halos, the transfer mechanism to the cells was assessed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the transfer system, action mechanism and its stronger antimicrobial activity, benzyl isothiocyanate was incorporated to two kinds of antimicrobial labels. The labels were stable and active for 140\u00a0days against two mould producers of ochratoxin A; Penicillium verrucosum is more sensitive than Aspergillus ochraceus. Details about the analytical techniques and the results obtained are shown and discussed. Graphical Abstract Antimicrobial evaluation of pure compounds, incorporation in the packaging and study for mode of action on S. coli by Raman, SEM and SPME-GC-MS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Isabel Clemente","Margarita Aznar","Jes\u00fas Salafranca","Cristina Ner\u00edn"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00216-016-0022-y","endpage":"1048","first_seen_on":"2017-01-26T11:57:04+00:00","issns":["1618-2642","1618-2650"],"issue":"4","journal":"Analytical & Bioanalytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1486503612,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00216-016-0022-y","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00216-016-0022-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00216-016-0022-y.pdf","pmid":"27783121","pubdate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Food Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Monitoring\/Environmental Analysis","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1037","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Raman spectroscopy, electronic microscopy and SPME-GC-MS to elucidate the mode of action of a new antimicrobial food packaging material","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00216-016-0022-y","volume":"409","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/raman-spectroscopy-electronic-microscopy-spmegcms-elucidate-mode-action-new-antimicrobial-food-packa-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":3.05,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":2062150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6106412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265021,"mean":12.782250539581,"rank":92374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":172444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265021,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2666,"mean":2.0105988742964,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2666,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154,"mean":3.3176732026144,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":2,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnalBioanalChem\/statuses\/824586871208611842","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15826486],"posted_on":"2017-01-26T11:56:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Anal Bioanal Chem","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/abc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/771693930471624704\/pI4l2RUO_normal.jpg","description":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry\n- Your society journal for rapid publication and global visibility of analytical research!","id_on_source":"AnalBioanalChem","tweeter_id":"2281899308","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":601},"tweet_id":"824586871208611842"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/I3Aunizar\/statuses\/824740965940338688","license":"gnip","rt":["AnalBioanalChem"],"citation_ids":[15826486],"posted_on":"2017-01-26T22:09:03+00:00","author":{"name":"I3A - UNIZAR","url":"http:\/\/i3a.unizar.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/596262797857693697\/SBNqL1p1_normal.jpg","description":"El I3A realiza I+D en las \u00e1reas de Ing.
