Rab5 deactivation is achieved by RabGAP5, a GTPase-activating protein, on the endosomes. Here, we report that recruitment of RabGAP5 is insufficient to deactivate Rab5 and that developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 2 (DRG2) is required for Rab5 deactivation and Tfn recycling. DRG2 was associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P)-containing endosomes. It colocalized and interacted with EEA1 and Rab5 on endosomes in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-dependent manner. DRG2 depletion did not affect Tfn uptake and recruitment of RabGAP5 and Rac1 to Rab5 endosomes. However, it resulted in impairment of interaction between Rab5 and RabGAP5, Rab5 deactivation on endosomes, and Tfn recycling. Ectopic expression of shRNA-resistant DRG2 rescued Tfn recycling in DRG2 depleted cells. Our results demonstrate DRG2 as an endosomal protein and a key regulator for Rab5 deactivation and Tfn recycling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Muralidharan Mani","Unn Hwa Lee","Nal Ae Yoon","Hyo Jeong Kim","Myoung Seok Ko","Wongi Seol","Yeonsoo Joe","Hun Taeg Chung","Byung Ju Lee","Chang Hoon Moon","Wha Ja Cho","Jeong Woo Park"],"doi":"10.1091\/mbc.e15-08-0558","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T11:17:38+00:00","issns":["1939-4586"],"journal":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","last_mentioned_on":1453921364,"links":["http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/27\/2\/334"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/content\/27\/2\/334.full.pdf","pmid":"26582392","pubdate":"2016-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 2 coordinates Rab5 activity and transferrin recycling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmentally-regulated-gtpbinding-protein-2-coordinates-rab5-activity-transferrin-recycling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7054473,"mean":6.2693339663096,"rank":5032902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1770698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7054473,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307228,"mean":9.1557444625633,"rank":193325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307228,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2426,"mean":3.3014606185567,"rank":2026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2426,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":3.1951282051282,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
