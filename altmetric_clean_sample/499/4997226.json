Notch signaling is modified by posttranslational glycosylations of the Notch extracellular EGF-like domain. In order to evaluate the structural and functional roles of various glycoforms at multiple EGF domains in the human Notch transmembrane receptor, we established a universal method for the construction of NOTCH1 EGF modules displaying the desired O-glycans at the designated glycosylation sites. The versatility of the present strategy was demonstrated by the rapid and highly efficient synthesis of NOTCH1 EGF12 concurrently having a \uf062-D-glucopyranose-initiated glycan (Xyl\uf0611\u21923Xyl\uf020\uf0611\u21923Glc\uf0621\u2192) at Ser458 and \uf061-L-fucopyranose-initiated glycan (Neu5Ac\uf0612\u21923Gal\uf0621\u21924GlcNAc\uf0621\u21923Fuc\uf0611\u2192) at Thr466. The efficiency of the proper folding of the glycosylated EGF12 was markedly enhanced in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2. An NMR study revealed the existence of strong NOEs between key sugar moieties and neighboring amino acid residues, indicating that both O-glycans contribute independently to the intramolecular stabilization of the anti-parallel \uf062-sheet structure in the ligand-binding region of EGF12. A preliminary test using synthetic human NOTCH1 EGF modules showed significant inhibitory effects on the proliferation and adhesiveness of the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7 and lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line, A549, demonstrating for the first time an evidence that exogenously applied synthetic EGF modules have the ability to interact with intrinsic Notch ligands on the surface of cancer cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Hayakawa, Shun","Koide, Ryosuke","Hinou, Hiroshi","Nishimura, Shin-Ichiro"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b01284","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T11:14:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4995"],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1453940782,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26765751?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b01284"],"pmid":"26765751","pubdate":"2016-01-15T22:00:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Synthetic Human NOTCH1 EGF Modules Unraveled Molecular Mechanisms for the Structural and Functional Roles of Calcium Ions and O-Glycans in the Ligand-Binding Region","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthetic-human-notch1-egf-modules-unraveled-molecular-mechanisms-structural-functional-roles-calciu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":3514262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2032917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307336,"mean":9.1580079652494,"rank":159453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":114151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307336,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6362,"mean":2.6006980034586,"rank":4528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6362,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":1.8876984126984,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
