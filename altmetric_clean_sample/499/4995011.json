There was no significant difference in the mean number of cases suggested (4.2 vs 4.6) or discussed (3.3 vs 3.1) per morbidity and mortality conference. There was also no significant difference in the mean number of adverse events identified per morbidity and mortality conference (3.4 vs 4.3). However, there was an increase in the proportion of cases discussed using a standard case review tool, but this did not reach statistical significance (27% vs 45%; p = 0.231). Nevertheless, we observed a significant increase in the mean number of quality improvement interventions suggested (2.4 vs 5.6; p < 0.001) and implemented (1.7 vs 4.4; p < 0.001) per morbidity and mortality conference. All adverse event categories identified had corresponding interventions suggested after the systems-oriented morbidity and mortality conference was instituted compared with before (80% vs 100%). Intervention-to-adverse event ratios per category were also higher (mean, 0.6 vs 1.5).\nA structured systems-oriented PICU morbidity and mortality conference incorporating elements of medical incident analysis improves the process of reviewing and responding to adverse events by significantly increasing quality improvement interventions suggested and implemented. Future work would involve testing locally adapted versions of the systems-oriented morbidity and mortality conference in multiple inpatient settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Cifra, Christina L","Bembea, Melania M","Fackler, James C","Miller, Marlene R"],"doi":"10.1097\/pcc.0000000000000539","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T21:48:12+00:00","issns":["1529-7535"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1461411113,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Transforming_the_Morbidity_and_Mortality.9.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/01000\/Transforming_the_Morbidity_and_Mortality.9.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26492062"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/2016\/01000\/Transforming_the_Morbidity_and_Mortality.9.pdf","pmid":"26492062","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"58","subjects":["criticalcare","pediatrics"],"title":"Transforming the Morbidity and Mortality Conference to Promote Safety and Quality in a PICU*","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transforming-morbidity-mortality-conference-promote-safety-quality-picu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3134535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4424291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313198,"mean":9.2658913144121,"rank":115316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":195722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313198,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1981,"mean":2.1677050505051,"rank":513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1981,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.9027272727273,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Social Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedCritCareMed\/statuses\/687753015625830402","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4995011],"posted_on":"2016-01-14T21:47:51+00:00","author":{"name":"PCCM","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000851598361\/37fe116807faf804d7b38b36804903df_normal.jpeg","description":"\"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine\" is written for the entire multidisciplinary team.
