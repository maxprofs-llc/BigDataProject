The selective reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds of diazaporphyrins provides 18\u03c0 aromatic isobacteriochlorin-type products, while the reduction of carbon-nitrogen double bonds leads to selective formation of 20\u03c0 N,N'-dihydrodiazaporphyrins in excellent yields. The distinct antiaromatic character of N,N'-dihydrodiazaporphyrins has been revealed. The free-base N,N'-dihydrodiazaporphyrin exhibited slower inner NH tautomerism than that in the corresponding 18\u03c0 porphyrins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Yamaji, Ayaka","Tsurugi, Hayato","Miyake, Yoshihiro","Mashima, Kazushi","Shinokubo, Hiroshi"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201600066","endpage":"3961","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T13:52:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"12","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452772647,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201600066\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201600066\/pdf","pmid":"26762221","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"3956","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Chemo\u2010 and Regioselective Reduction of 5,15\u2010Diazaporphyrins Providing Antiaromatic Azaporphyrinoids","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemo-regioselective-reduction-515diazaporphyrins-providing-antiaromatic-azaporphyrinoids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":3445060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2023592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305286,"mean":9.1115127045218,"rank":157677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":114352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305286,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4687,"mean":2.9698224498506,"rank":1954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4687,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":3.7023896848138,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
