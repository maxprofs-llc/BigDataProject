They were also asked to rate the extent to which therapy helped them cope with their difficulties.\nMost patients (12,549-86.0 %, 95 % CI: 85.5-86.6) expressed a preference for at least one aspect of their treatment. Of these, 4,600 (36.7 %, 95 % CI: 35.8-37.5) had at least one preference that was not met. While most patients reported that their preference for appointment times, venue and type of treatment were met, only 1,769 (40.5 %) of the 4,253 that had a preference for gender had it met. People who expressed a preference that was not met reported poorer outcomes than those with a preference that was met (Odds Ratios: appointment times\u2009=\u20090.29, venue\u2009=\u20090.32, treatment type\u2009=\u20090.16, therapist gender\u2009=\u20090.32, language in which treatment was delivered\u2009=\u20090.40).\nMost patients who took part in this survey had preferences about their treatment. People who reported preferences that were not met were less likely to state that treatment had helped them with their problems. Routinely assessing and meeting patient preferences may improve the outcomes of psychological treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d7","authors":["Ryan Williams","Lorna Farquharson","Lucy Palmer","Paul Bassett","Jeremy Clarke","David M Clark","Mike J Crawford","David M.
