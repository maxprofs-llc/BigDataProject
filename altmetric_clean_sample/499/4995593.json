Voles concur"],"citation":{"abstract":"Affiliative social relationships are impacted by stressors and can shape responses to stress. However, the effects of stress on social relationships in different contexts are not well understood. Meadow voles provide an opportunity to study these effects on peer relationships outside of a reproductive context. In winter months, female meadow voles cohabit with peers of both sexes, and social huddling is facilitated by exposure to short, winter-like day lengths in the lab. We investigated the role of stress and corticosterone (cort) levels in social behavior in short day-housed female meadow voles. A brief forced swim elevated cort levels, and we assessed the effects of this stressor on new and established relationships between females. In pairs formed following exposure to swim stress, the stressor significantly reduced the fraction of huddling time subjects spent with a familiar partner. Swim stress did not affect partner preferences in pairs established prior to the stressor. Finally, we examined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels via immunoassay in voles housed under short day (10h light) versus long day (14h light) conditions and detected higher glucocorticoid levels in long day-housed voles. These findings support a role for stress regulation in the formation of social relationships in female meadow voles, and support a potential role for seasonal variation in cort in the behavioral transition from solitary to social. Together they highlight the importance of stress and possibly glucocorticoid signaling for social behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029fe","authors":["Anacker, Allison M J","Reitz, Kara M","Goodwin, Nastacia L","Beery, Annaliese K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yhbeh.2016.01.004","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T01:27:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0018506X","1095-6867"],"journal":"Hormones & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1453749242,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0018506X16300228","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0018506X16300228&_version=1&md5=1a05c20b64a192ed8838273ace6deeba"],"pmid":"26777726","pubdate":"2016-01-19T22:01:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Stress impairs new but not established relationships in seasonally social voles ","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stress-impairs-new-not-established-relationships-seasonally-social-voles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7550272,"mean":6.5198078747069,"rank":866575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6682275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7550272,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313395,"mean":9.2692167303775,"rank":47424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":265846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313395,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1011,"mean":8.6350455445545,"rank":212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1011,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":15.737461538462,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":6,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
