Structural, biochemical, and biological studies provided much insight into how vinculin binds to membranes, what components it recognizes, and how lipid binding is regulated. Here we discuss the roles and mechanisms of phospholipids in regulating the structure and function of vinculin and of its muscle specific metavinculin splice variant. A full appreciation of these processes is necessary for understanding how vinculin regulates cell motility, migration, wound healing, and of its role in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Izard, Tina","Brown, David T","Tina Izard","David T.
