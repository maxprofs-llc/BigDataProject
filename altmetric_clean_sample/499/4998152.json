Presently there is no strategy to prevent visual loss in this kind of tumour. This study evaluated the effects of nerve growth factor administration in protecting visual function in patients with optic pathway glioma-related visual impairment. A prospective randomized double-blind phase II clinical trial was conducted in 18 optic pathway glioma patients, aged from 2 to 23 years, with stable disease and severe visual loss. Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive a single 10-day course of 0.5 mg murine nerve growth factor as eye drops, while eight patients received placebo. All patients were evaluated before and after treatment, testing visual acuity, visual field, visual-evoked potentials, optic coherence tomography, electroretinographic photopic negative response, and magnetic resonance imaging. Post-treatment evaluations were repeated at 15, 30, 90, and 180 days Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline and at 180 days. Treatment with nerve growth factor led to statistically significant improvements in objective electrophysiological parameters (electroretinographic photopic negative response amplitude at 180 days and visual-evoked potentials at 30 days), which were not observed in placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, in patients in whom visual fields could still be measured, visual field worsening was only observed in placebo-treated cases, while three of four nerve growth factor-treated subjects showed significant visual field enlargement. This corresponded to improved visually guided behaviour, as reported by the patients and\/or the caregivers. There was no evidence of side effects related to nerve growth factor treatment. Nerve growth factor eye drop administration appears a safe, easy and effective strategy for the treatment of visual loss associated with optic pathway gliomas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["Benedetto Falsini","Antonio Chiaretti","Daniela Rizzo","Marco Piccardi","Antonio Ruggiero","Luigi Manni","Marzia Soligo","Anna Dickmann","Matteo Federici","Annabella Salerni","Laura Timelli","Gaspare Guglielmi","Ilaria Lazzareschi","Massimo Caldarelli","Lucia Galli-Resta","Cesare Colosimo","Riccardo Riccardi"],"doi":"10.1093\/brain\/awv366","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T14:15:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2156"],"issue":"2","journal":"Brain: A Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1458891838,"links":["http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/12\/brain.awv366","http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/139\/2\/404","http:\/\/m.brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/139\/2\/404"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/brain.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/brain\/early\/2016\/01\/12\/brain.awv366.full.pdf","pmid":"26767384","pubdate":"2016-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Nerve growth factor improves visual loss in childhood optic gliomas: a randomized, double-blind, phase II clinical trial","type":"article","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nerve-growth-factor-improves-visual-loss-childhood-optic-gliomas-randomized-doubleblind-phase-ii-cli-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":1124719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6311214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311763,"mean":9.2680119642545,"rank":61428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":250121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311763,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3515,"mean":12.185146272055,"rank":1196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3515,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":24.563581395349,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
