Owing to the asymmetrical sizes of the head and tail blocks and the rectangular molecular interface, the giant surfactants assumed a truncated-wedge-like molecular shape, which induced morphological curvature during self-assembly, thus resulting in the formation of curved and concentric lamellae. These curved\/concentric lamellae were observed in FPOSS-based giant surfactants with different architectures and compositions. The spontaneous curvature formation not only promotes our fundamental understanding of assembly principles, but also provides a promising and efficient approach to the fabrication of a wide range of high-performance devices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Dong, Xue\u2010Hui","Ni, Bo","Huang, Mingjun","Hsu, Chih\u2010Hao","Bai, Ruobing","Zhang, Wen\u2010Bin","Shi, An\u2010Chang","Cheng, Stephen Z.
