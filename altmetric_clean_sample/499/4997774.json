Genetic improvement of salt tolerance is essential for sustainable soybean production in saline areas. In this study, we isolated a gene (Ncl) that could synchronously regulate the transport and accumulation of Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) from a Brazilian soybean cultivar FT-Abyara using map-based cloning strategy. Higher expression of the salt tolerance gene Ncl in the root resulted in lower accumulations of Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) in the shoot under salt stress. Transfer of Ncl with the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method into a soybean cultivar Kariyutaka significantly enhanced its salt tolerance. Introgression of the tolerance allele into soybean cultivar Jackson, using DNA marker-assisted selection (MAS), produced an improved salt tolerance line. Ncl could increase soybean grain yield by 3.6-5.5 times in saline field conditions. Using Ncl in soybean breeding through gene transfer or MAS would contribute to sustainable soybean production in saline-prone areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Tuyen Duc Do","Huatao Chen","Vu Thi Thu Hien","Aladdin Hamwieh","Tetsuya Yamada","Tadashi Sato","Yongliang Yan","Hua Cong","Mariko Shono","Kazuhiro Suenaga","Donghe Xu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep19147","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T12:42:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1453053157,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep19147"],"pmcid":"PMC4705485","pmid":"26744076","pubdate":"2016-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant breeding","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Plant genetics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Ncl Synchronously Regulates Na+, K+, and Cl\u2212 in Soybean and Greatly Increases the Grain Yield in Saline Field Conditions","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ncl-synchronously-regulates-na-k-cl-soybean-greatly-increases-grain-yield-saline-field-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6982524,"mean":6.2409015629427,"rank":1370463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5603046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6982524,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306261,"mean":9.117426500359,"rank":74028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":231539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306261,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25066,"mean":14.436689806503,"rank":7466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":17560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25066,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2801,"mean":16.063750714286,"rank":840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2801,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
