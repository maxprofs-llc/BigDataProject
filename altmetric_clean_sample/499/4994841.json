All tests were performed on the same sample. Cytology-positive women were referred to colposcopy; cytology-negative women were referred to one-year HPV re-testing. The endpoint was CIN2+ at baseline or follow up.\nSensitivity was 77.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.3-86.7) and 53.2% (95%CI: 40.3-65.4) for cytology at atypical squamous cells of udetermined significance (ASC-US) and high-grade threshold, and 87.6% (95%CI:75.7-93.6), and 80.8% (95%CI: 67.6-89.8) for p16INK4a-Ki67, and E6\/E7mRNA, respectively. Colposcopy referral was 36% (95%CI: 31.2-40.9) and 11.2% (95%CI: 7.8-14.1) for cytology at ASC-US and high-grade threshold, respectively, and 36.0% (95%CI: 29.9-29.6), and 47.5% (95%CI: 32.5-42.4) for p16(INK4a)-Ki67, and E6\/E7mRNA, respectively. Strategies referring high-grade cytology or biomarker positive women to colposcopy reached sensitivity close to 100%, with modest increase in colposcopy referral.\nThe high sensitivity of combined strategies probably allows longer intervals in HPV-positive, triage-negative women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f4","authors":["Daniela Gustinucci","Paolo Giorgi Rossi","Elena Cesarini","Massimo Broccolini","Simonetta Bulletti","Angela Carlani","Valentina D\u2019angelo","Maria Rosaria D\u2019amico","Eugenio Di Dato","Paola Galeazzi","Morena Malaspina","Nadia Martinelli","Nicoletta Spita","Beatrice Tintori","Maria Donata Giaimo","Basilio Passamonti"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajcp\/aqv019","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T20:41:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-7722"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1453678881,"links":["http:\/\/ajcp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/145\/1\/35"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/ajcpath\/145\/1\/35.full.pdf","pmid":"26712869","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Use of Cytology, E6\/E7 mRNA, and p16INK4a\u2013Ki-67 to Define the Management of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)\u2013Positive Women in Cervical Cancer Screening","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytology-e6e7-mrna-p16ink4aki67-define-management-human-papillomavirus-hpvpositive-women-cervical-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7017937,"mean":6.2626215194869,"rank":1450026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5560118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7017937,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306103,"mean":9.1390537990602,"rank":76673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":228831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306103,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1082,"mean":4.0036392229417,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1082,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":12.22,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
