To investigate whether a molecular favourable-risk genotype can be identified, we investigated CEBPA, NPM1 and FLT3 status and prognostic impact in a cohort of 301 patients aged 60\u00a0years or more with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, all treated intensively. Overall survival (OS) at 1\u00a0year was highest in the 12 patients (4%) that were CEBPA(DM) compared to the 76 (28%) with a mutant NPM1 and wild-type FLT3 (NPM1(MUT) FLT3(WT) ) genotype or all other patients (75%, 54%, 33% respectively), with median survival 15\u00b72, 13\u00b76 and 6\u00b76\u00a0months, although the benefit was short-term (OS at 3\u00a0years 17%, 29%, 12% respectively). Combination of the CEBPA(DM) and NPM1(MUT) FLT3(WT) genotype patients defined a molecular group with favourable prognosis (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001 in multivariate analysis), with 57% of patients alive at 1\u00a0year compared to 33% for all other patients. Knowledge of genotype in older cytogenetically intermediate-risk patients might influence therapy decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002446","authors":["Dickson, GJ"],"doi":"10.1111\/bjh.13873","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T16:44:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2141"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1452785629,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1473832\/"],"pmid":"26847745","pubdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"The value of molecular stratification for CEBPA_DM and NPM1_MUT_FLT3_WT genotypes in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia","type":"article","volume":"172","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/value-molecular-stratification-icebpai-supdmsup-inpm1i-supmutsup-iflt3i-supwtsup-genotypes-older-pat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7627836,"mean":6.5633335207133,"rank":6601973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7627836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313930,"mean":9.2642696405873,"rank":263776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313930,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2314,"mean":2.833084306096,"rank":2094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":1.8515625,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ucl_discovery\/statuses\/687658889333059584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4993656],"posted_on":"2016-01-14T15:33:49+00:00","author":{"name":"UCL Discovery","url":"http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/631451975817805824\/GfvbIz0w_normal.png","description":"UCL Discovery is a central open access showcase of UCL research.
