Sample Prep"],"citation":{"abstract":"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of molecules formed from the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with the free amino groups of proteins. The abundance of AGEs in a variety of age-related diseases, including diabetic complications and atherosclerosis, and their pathophysiological effects suggest the existence of innate defense mechanisms. Here we examined the presence of serum protein(s) that are capable of binding glycated bovine serum albumin (AGEs-BSA), prepared upon incubation of BSA with dehydroascorbate, and identified complement component C1q subcomponent subunit A as a novel AGEs-binding protein in human serum. A molecular interaction analysis showed the specific binding of C1q to the AGEs-BSA. In addition, we identified DNA-binding regions of C1q, including collagen-like domain, as the AGEs-binding site and established that the amount of positive charge on the binding site was the determining factor. C1q indeed recognized several other modified proteins, including acylated proteins, suggesting that the binding specificity of C1q might be ascribed, at least in part, to the electronegative potential of the ligand proteins. We also observed that C1q was involved in the AGEs-BSA-activated deposition of complement proteins, C3b and C4b. In addition, the AGEs-BSA mediated the proteolytic cleavage of complement protein 5 (C5) to release C5a. These findings provide the first evidence for AGEs as a new ligand recognized by C1q, stimulating the C1q-dependent classical complement pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Miho Chikazawa"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00777","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T03:31:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4995"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1453289808,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00777","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26731343"],"pmid":"26731343","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:10:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of C1q as a Binding Protein for Advanced Glycation End Products.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-c1q-binding-protein-advanced-glycation-end-products"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":4980547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1767272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305739,"mean":9.1338926989773,"rank":191875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":95853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305739,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6338,"mean":2.5993435379517,"rank":5287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6338,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":1.8233082706767,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
