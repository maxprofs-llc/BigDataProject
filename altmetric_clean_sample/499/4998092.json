Eight S-ions were chemically assigned by using the reference data according to the guidelines of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative. Three ions detected in garlic were assigned as derived from the isomers \u03b3-glutamyl-S-1-propenylcysteine and \u03b3-glutamyl-S-2-propenylcysteine and as S-2-propenylmercaptoglutathione on the basis of differences in key product ions identified in reference tandem MS spectra.\nThe ability to discriminate between such geometric isomers will be extremely useful for the chemical assignment of unknown metabolites in MS-based metabolomics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["Nakabayashi, Ryo","Sawada, Yuji","Aoyagi, Morihiro","Yamada, Yutaka","Hirai, Masami Yokota","Sakurai, Tetsuya","Kamoi, Takahiro","Rowan, Daryl D","Saito, Kazuki","Ryo Nakabayashi","Yuji Sawada","Morihiro Aoyagi","Yutaka Yamada","Masami Yokota Hirai","Tetsuya Sakurai","Takahiro Kamoi","Daryl D Rowan","Kazuki Saito"],"doi":"10.3945\/jn.114.202317","first_seen_on":"2016-01-15T14:04:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-6100","0022-3166"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1454968020,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26764333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/146\/2\/397S.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/146\/2\/397S.full.pdf","pmid":"26764333","pubdate":"2016-01-15T22:01:07+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Nutrition","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Chemical Assignment of Structural Isomers of Sulfur-Containing Metabolites in Garlic by Liquid Chromatography-Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance-Mass Spectrometry.","type":"article","volume":"146","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemical-assignment-structural-isomers-sulfurcontaining-metabolites-garlic-liquid-chromatography-fou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.79,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.79},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029773,"mean":6.8058472945396,"rank":1067822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6962089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029773,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319484,"mean":9.3690019625456,"rank":53565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":265912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319484,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3877,"mean":13.491489164087,"rank":1187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3877,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":20.570483870968,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/plant_biology\/statuses\/687998636710428672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4998092],"posted_on":"2016-01-15T14:03:52+00:00","author":{"name":"plantbio","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"plant_biology","tweeter_id":"3182517054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":106},"tweet_id":"687998636710428672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PakamamaniRenew\/statuses\/688016583202091009","license":"gnip","rt":["plant_biology"],"citation_ids":[4998092],"posted_on":"2016-01-15T15:15:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Peter Norbert Semrau","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/785589982606098432\/vvJZsDAm_normal.jpg","description":"Bioing.grad,Shamano,Permaculture-Activist,Holistic & Integrative environmental Engineering,NoNuke,NAMASTE !","id_on_source":"PakamamaniRenew","tweeter_id":"2178104040","geo":{"lt":42.83333,"ln":12.83333,"country":"IT"},"followers":5297},"tweet_id":"688016583202091009"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Studies funded by a garlic supplement maker find specific health benefits for garlic.
