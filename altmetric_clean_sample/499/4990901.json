Residual deviation and stability of strabismus were evaluated at 18 months follow up.\nA prospective, analytical, quasi-experimental study was conducted on a cohort of 21 patients who underwent total cycloplegic refraction and with a residual deviation of at least 14 DP. A botulinum toxin type A dose of 5 IU was injected into each medial rectus muscle for a residual deviation greater than 18 DP, with a dose of 2.5 IU being used for a deviation between 14 and 18 DP. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to relate residual deviation to variables recorded as potential predictors.\nA total of 21 patients were included, 33.3% (n=7) males and 66.6% (n=14) females. Mean visual acuity was -.28\u00b1.25 logMAR for right eye (range 0 to -1) and -.42\u00b1.31 logMAR for left eye (range 0 to -1.3). Mean angle of residual deviation before application of botulinum toxin was 40.95\u00b18.6DP without spectacles correction, and 22.3\u00b17.99 DP with full cycloplegic refraction. Adverse effects were ptosis in 14.2% (n=3), diplopia 23.8% (n=5), and vertical deviation in 33% (n=7). One patient had a poor outcome, therefore required surgical treatment. At one year follow up, 85.71% of patients showed good results with esotropia of 12 DP or less, dropping to 71.43% at 18 months of follow up.\nBotulinum toxin type A is an effective long-term treatment with a good response in 71.43% of patients. No predictors of good response were demonstrated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b08","authors":["Flores-Reyes, E M","Castillo-L\u00f3pez, M G","Toledo-Silva, R","Vargas-Ortega, J","Murillo-Correa, C E","Aguilar-Ruiz, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.oftal.2015.11.007","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T03:34:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1989-7286"],"journal":"Archivos de la Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Oftalmolog\u00eda","last_mentioned_on":1452739212,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26747023?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26747023","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:05:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Botulinum toxin type A as treatment of partially accommodative esotropia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uso-toxina-botul%C3%ADnica-en-el-tratamiento-las-endotrop%C3%ADas-parcialmente-acomodativas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":5985263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305286,"mean":9.1114596393532,"rank":249266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305286,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":0.68924731182796,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":0.455,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/687464200147460096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4990901],"posted_on":"2016-01-14T02:40:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
