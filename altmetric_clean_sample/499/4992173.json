Although RAGE does not have any kinase motifs in its cytosolic domain, the interaction between RAGE and A\u03b2 triggers multiple cellular signaling involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of signal transduction by RAGE remains still unknown. Therefore, identifying binding proteins of RAGE may provide novel therapeutic targets for AD.\nIn this study, we identified p38-regulated\/activated protein kinase (PRAK) as a novel RAGE interacting molecule. To investigate the effect of A\u03b2 on PRAK mediated RAGE signaling pathway, we treated SH-SY5Y cells with monomeric form of A\u03b2. We demonstrated that A\u03b2 significantly increased the phosphorylation of PRAK as well as the interaction between PRAK and RAGE. We showed that knockdown of PRAK rescued mTORC1 inactivation induced by A\u03b2 treatment and decreased the formation of A\u03b2-induced autophagosome.\nWe provide evidence that PRAK plays a critical role in AD pathology as a key interactor of RAGE. Thus, our data suggest that PRAK might be a potential therapeutic target of AD involved in RAGE-mediated cell signaling induced by A\u03b2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008af","authors":["Kim, Yoonhee","Kim, Chaeyoung","Son, Sung Min","Song, Hyundong","Hong, Hyun Seok","Han, Sun-Ho","Mook-Jung, Inhee"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13024-016-0068-5","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T13:36:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1750-1326"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Neurodegeneration","last_mentioned_on":1453687360,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26758977?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26758977"],"pmcid":"PMC4709948","pmid":"26758977","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:01:02+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neurology"],"title":"The novel RAGE interactor PRAK is associated with autophagy signaling in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-rage-interactor-prak-associated-autophagy-signaling-alzheimers-disease-pathogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7028853,"mean":6.2639093712573,"rank":691196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6332840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7028853,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306195,"mean":9.1429657341422,"rank":40668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":265013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306195,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":7.532275862069,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":13.033166666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
