Structural equation modeling (SEM) and the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) were used to test the bidirectional dyadic association of both the survivors' and the spouses' dissociation with PTSD symptoms. The results demonstrate a positive association between both the survivors' trait dissociation and PTSD symptoms, and between the spouses' trait dissociation and their PTSD symptoms. However, no significant associations were found on the bidirectional level. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the role of trait dissociation in PTSD. While trait dissociation is associated with higher PTSD symptoms for both survivors and their spouses, its role may be limited in the bidirectional partner context. Theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000140c","authors":["Weinberg, Michael","Besser, Avi","Ataria, Yochai","Neria, Yuval"],"doi":"10.1080\/15299732.2015.1130006","first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T19:09:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1529-9740"],"journal":"Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation","last_mentioned_on":1452798269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26684023"],"pmid":"26684023","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:28:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Survivor-Spousal Dissociation and PTSD: Personal and Dyad Relationships.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survivorspouse-dissociation-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-personal-dyad-relationships"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":3445068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2023594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305286,"mean":9.1115369441667,"rank":157682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":114342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305286,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":5.459014084507,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":6.3642857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":4,"Unspecified":2,"Philosophy":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfAviBesser\/statuses\/687711904584876032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4994505],"posted_on":"2016-01-14T19:04:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Prof. Avi Besser","url":"http:\/\/avibesser.weebly.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/636995667915702272\/z15XYXjn_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/he.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%D7%90%D7\u2026","id_on_source":"ProfAviBesser","tweeter_id":"3362997373","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":31},"tweet_id":"687711904584876032"}]}}
