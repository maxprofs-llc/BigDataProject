Despite recent progresses, several limitations still hinder the ability to flexibly assemble and collectively share different types of DNA segments. Here, we describe an advanced system for joining DNA fragments from a universal library that automatically maintains open reading frames (ORFs) and does not require linkers, adaptors, sequence homology, amplification or mutation (domestication) of fragments in order to work properly. This system, which is enhanced by a unique buffer formulation, provides unforeseen capabilities for testing, and sharing, complex multi-gene circuitry assembled from different DNA fragments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["De Paoli, Henrique Cestari","Tuskan, Gerald A","Yang, Xiaohan","Henrique Cestari De Paoli","Gerald A.
