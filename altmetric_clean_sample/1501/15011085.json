Four different types of impulse control measures were used: Self reports of impulse control, staff ratings, interviewer's ratings, and tests of impulse control. Impulse control measures yielded statistically significant multiple correlations with all outcome measures except life satisfaction. The findings suggest that impulse control in its various forms has a consistent and significant relationship with indices of adaptation. Utilizing stepwise regression analyses, the best predictors of outcome among impulse control measures are presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dc3","authors":["Boaz Kahana","Eva Kahana"],"doi":"10.1093\/geronj\/30.6.679","endpage":"687","first_seen_on":"2016-12-24T08:55:16+00:00","issns":["0022-1422"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Gerontology","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/geronj\/30.6.679"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/geronj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/30\/6\/679.full.pdf","pmid":"1184927","pubdate":"1975-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"679","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The Relationship of Impulse Control to Cognition and Adjustment Among Institutionalized Aged Women","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-impulse-control-cognition-adjustment-among-institutionalized-aged-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6846281,"mean":6.1857509754176,"rank":1593813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4509860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6846281,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95279,"mean":11.153661390877,"rank":28403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":65522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95279,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":4.5070238095238,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
