Each group was matched by position and trained 4-days.wk(-1) for 15 weeks. Testing consisted of field tests to evaluate strength (1RM squat and bench press), 40-yard sprint, agility, vertical jump height (VJ), and vertical jump power (VJP). No significant pre- to posttraining differences were observed in 1RM bench press, 40-yard sprint, agility, VJ or in VJP in either group. Significant improvements were seen in 1RM squat in both the OL and PL groups. After log10-transformation, OL were observed to have a significantly greater improvement in Delta VJ than PL. Despite an 18% greater improvement in 1RM squat (p > 0.05), and a twofold greater improvement (p > 0.05) in 40-yard sprint time by OL, no further significant group differences were seen. Results suggest that OL can provide a significant advantage over PL in vertical jump performance changes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040e2","authors":["Hoffman JR","Cooper J","Wendell M","Kang J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-12T15:40:18+00:00","issns":["1064-8011"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research","last_mentioned_on":1499739129,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14971971","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14971971\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14971971"],"pmid":"14971971","pubdate":"2004-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"HUMAN KINETICS PUBLISHERS, INC.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Comparison of Olympic vs. traditional power lifting training programs in football players.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-olympic-vs-traditional-power-lifting-training-programs-football-players"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":1700349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6480590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294861,"mean":6.8038820389337,"rank":67101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":227006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294861,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3845,"mean":16.277959937565,"rank":2182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3845,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":20.744019047619,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
