The purpose of risk stratification is not to decide time of therapy but to prognosticate. There is general consensus that risk stratification is applicable to newly diagnosed patients; however, some genetic abnormalities characteristic of poor outcome at diagnosis may suggest poor outcome if only detected at the time of relapse. Thus, in good-risk patients, it is necessary to evaluate for high-risk features at relapse. Although detection of any cytogenetic abnormality is considered to suggest higher-risk disease, the specific abnormalities considered as poor risk are cytogenetically detected chromosomal 13 or 13q deletion, t(4;14) and del17p, and detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization of t(4;14), t(14;16), and del17p. Detection of 13q deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization only, in absence of other abnormalities, is not considered a high-risk feature. High serum \u03b2(2)-microglobulin level and International Staging System stages II and III, incorporating high \u03b2(2)-microglobulin and low albumin, are considered to predict higher risk disease. There was a consensus that the high-risk features will change in the future, with introduction of other new agents or possibly new combinations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Munshi NC","Anderson KC","Bergsagel PL","Shaughnessy J","Palumbo A","Durie B","Fonseca R","Stewart AK","Harousseau JL","Dimopoulos M","Jagannath S","Hajek R","Sezer O","Kyle R","Sonneveld P","Cavo M","Rajkumar SV","San Miguel J","Crowley J","Avet-Loiseau H","Nikhil C.
