RNA-sequencing, along with other next-generation sequencing-based approaches, enables their study on a genome-wide scale, at maximal resolution, and across multiple conditions. This review discusses how sequencing-based studies are providing global insights into lncRNA transcription, post-transcriptional processing, expression regulation and sites of function. The next few years will deepen our insight into the overall contribution of lncRNAs to genome function and to the information flow from genotype to phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003508","authors":["Atkinson SR","Marguerat S","B\u00e4hler J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.semcdb.2011.12.003","first_seen_on":"2012-12-08T22:04:52+00:00","funders":["wellcome","bbsrc"],"issns":["1084-9521","10849521"],"journal":"Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1354132121,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1084952111002394","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22202731"],"pmid":"22202731","pubdate":"2011-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Exploring long non-coding RNAs through sequencing.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-long-noncoding-rnas-through-sequencing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.346,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.346},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":561670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3123414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276496,"mean":5.6508450785732,"rank":49137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":227357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276496,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":2.1561929824561,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":72,"Student  > Ph.
