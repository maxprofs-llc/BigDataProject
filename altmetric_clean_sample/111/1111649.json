The genetic underpinnings of many epilepsies are still being elucidated, and we expect further advances over the coming 5 years, as genetic technology improves and prices fall for whole exome and whole genome sequencing. At present, there are several well-characterized complex epilepsies associated with single gene disorders; we review some of these here. They include well-recognized syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy associated with Rett syndrome, some of the progressive myoclonic epilepsies, and novel disorders such as epilepsy associated with mutations in the PCDH 19 gene. These disorders are important in informing genetic testing to confirm a diagnosis and to permit better understanding of the variability in phenotype-genotype correlation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["Merwick A","O'Brien M","Delanty N"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2012.03617.x","first_seen_on":"2012-12-07T15:48:14+00:00","issns":["0013-9580"],"issue":"","journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1352891124,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22946725?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"22946725","pubdate":"2012-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Complex single gene disorders and epilepsy.","type":"article","volume":"53 Suppl 4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complex-single-gene-disorders-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2903029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":76430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276162,"mean":5.6808816885802,"rank":220098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276162,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1504,"mean":3.1769860279441,"rank":1162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1504,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":3.6744361702128,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
