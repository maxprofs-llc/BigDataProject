Samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using procaine hydrochloride as the internal standard. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetex PFP column using isocratic elution. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of acetonitrile (33%, v\/v) and 0.005M ammonium trifluoroacetate buffer (67%, v\/v; pH 4.93 \u00b1 0.03) with a flow rate of 0.350 mL\/min. The diode array detection was performed at 262 nm. The method was linear over the concentration range of 25-2,400 ng\/mL. Intra-day and inter-day precision values for cathinones were less than 1.26% (relative standard deviation). The limit of detection for any compounds extracted from human urine by the optimized SPE method was 40 ng\/mL and the limit of quantification was 100 ng\/mL in the urine. The recovery rate of SPE was between 71 and 82% with a lower relative standard deviation than 2.35%.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf5","authors":["Mayer M","Benko A","Husz\u00e1r A","Sipos K","Lajtai A","Lakatos A","Porp\u00e1czy Z"],"doi":"10.1093\/chromsci\/bms183","first_seen_on":"2012-12-11T07:36:15+00:00","issns":["0021-9665"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Chromatographic Science","last_mentioned_on":1355211370,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23192736"],"pmid":"23192736","pubdate":"2012-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Simultaneous Determination of 4-Substituted Cathinones (4-MMC, 4-MEC and 4-FMC) in Human Urine by HPLC-DAD.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-determination-4substituted-cathinones-4mmc-4mec-4fmc-human-urine-hplcdad"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3080545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":961450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281339,"mean":5.8979330911574,"rank":192436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281339,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":1.2915384615385,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LGCStds_For\/statuses\/278402783827353600","license":"public","citation_ids":[1116838],"posted_on":"2012-12-11T07:36:10+00:00","author":{"name":"LGC Standards","url":"http:\/\/www.lgcstandards.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/467253754626977792\/oMM2SeSB_normal.jpeg","description":"News on forensic toxicology & reference standards from LGC Standards; supplier of products & services for accuracy in analytical measurement","id_on_source":"LGCStds_For","tweeter_id":"317013188","geo":{"lt":51.427051,"ln":-0.333344,"country":"GB"},"followers":527},"tweet_id":"278402783827353600"}]}}
