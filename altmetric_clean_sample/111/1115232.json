The present DNT study was conducted to generate historical data with the Wistar Han (WH) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rat strains, commonly used in Europe and the US, respectively. Potential differences between these strains in DNT endpoints have not been extensively investigated. Motor activity, startle response, learning and memory testing, and neurological (quantitative and qualitative) examinations were conducted using three groups of control, prenatally exposed (to Methylazoxymethanol [MAM] on gestation Day 15) and acutely treated (with IDPN, MK-801 or Chlorpromazine) animals for each strain. The positive controls produced clear effects in most endpoints investigated, with limited functional differences in baseline behavior and positive control sensitivity. However, SD rats were considerably more susceptible to MAM-induced learning and memory impairments and neurological damage. These data highlight differential sensitivity between the strains, which may require risk assessment consideration for developmental neurotoxicants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003460","authors":["Zmarowski A","Beekhuijzen M","Lensen J","Emmen H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.reprotox.2012.05.091","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T15:56:29+00:00","issns":["0890-6238","08906238"],"journal":"Reproductive Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1355070256,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0890623812002158"],"pmid":"22664268","pubdate":"2012-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["embryology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Differential performance of Wistar Han and Sprague Dawley rats in behavioral tests: Differences in baseline behavior and reactivity to positive control agents ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-performance-wistar-han-sprague-dawley-rats-behavioral-tests-differences-baseline-behavi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":2898876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276634,"mean":5.6806887030832,"rank":220030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276634,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":4.6693617021277,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.7773333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
