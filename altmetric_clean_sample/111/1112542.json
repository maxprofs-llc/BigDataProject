For some mosquito species the sterilization process and mating activity may alter male survival. Most previous studies were carried out in the laboratory and may inadequately reflect the field situation. We conducted a semi-field experiment to evaluate the impact of sugar supply and mating activity under natural climatic conditions on wild and sterile male Ae. albopictus longevity, using large cages set up in an open clearing between trees and shrubs in Reunion Island.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002168","authors":["Oliva CF","Maier MJ","Gilles J","Jacquet M","Lemperiere G","Quilici S","Vreysen MJ","Schooneman F","Chadee DD","Boyer S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.actatropica.2012.11.010","first_seen_on":"2012-12-08T05:29:27+00:00","issns":["0001-706X","0001706X"],"journal":"Acta Tropica","last_mentioned_on":1355167808,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001706X12003749"],"pmid":"23206578","pubdate":"2012-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Effects of irradiation, presence of females, and sugar supply on the longevity of sterile males Aedes albopictus (Skuse) under semi-field conditions on Reunion Island ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-irradiation-presence-females-sugar-supply-longevity-sterile-males-aedes-albopictus-skuse-und"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2087019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2384258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280847,"mean":5.8801528880597,"rank":122860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":154725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280847,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":2.0930248447205,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.6003333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
