These hybrids fit into three categories: inter- and intraspecific hybrids involving the taxa of Fallopia section Reynoutria (giant knotweeds), hybrids between Japanese knotweed and F. baldschuanica (Regel) Holub and hybrids between Japanese knotweed and the Australasian endemics of the genus Muehlenbeckia. In this minireview, the viability of the different classes of hybrid and the potential threats they pose are discussed in the context of recent examples of allopolyploid speciation, which generally involve hybridisation between a native and an alien species. Such wide hybridisations also challenge accepted taxonomic classifications. Japanese knotweed s.l. provides a fascinating example of the interplay between ploidy level, hybridisation and alien plant invasion. The octoploid (2n=88) Fallopia japonica var. japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decraene is a single female clone throughout much of its adventive range, and provides an ideal system for investigating the potential for wide hybridisation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029dd","authors":["J Bailey"],"doi":"10.1038\/hdy.2012.98","endpage":"110","first_seen_on":"2012-12-11T11:02:51+00:00","issns":["0018-067X","1365-2540"],"journal":"Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1494645478,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/hdy201298a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/hdy\/journal\/v110\/n2\/full\/hdy201298a.html"],"pmid":"23211787","pubdate":"2012-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"105","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The Japanese knotweed invasion viewed as a vast unintentional hybridisation experiment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/japanese-knotweed-invasion-viewed-vast-unintentional-hybridisation-experiment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":3440896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4707889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295034,"mean":6.8075243311765,"rank":105683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":186761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295034,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1113,"mean":6.9735341726619,"rank":756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1113,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.1654782608696,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
