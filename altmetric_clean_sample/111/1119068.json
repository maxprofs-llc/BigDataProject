We present the B3LYP-gCP-D3\/6-31G* scheme, which corrects for missing London dispersion and basis set superposition error (BSSE) in a physically sound manner. Benchmark results for the general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions set (GMTKN30) are presented. A detailed look is cast on organic reactions of several arenes with C(60), Diels-Alder reactions, and barriers to [4 + 3] cycloadditions. We demonstrate the practical advantages of the new B3LYP-gCP-D3\/6-31G* scheme and show its higher robustness over standard B3LYP\/6-31G*. B3LYP-gCP-D3\/6-31G* is meant to fully substitute standard B3LYP\/6-31G* calculations in the same black-box sense at essentially no increase in computational cost. The energy corrections are made available by a Web service ( http:\/\/www.thch.uni-bonn.de\/tc\/gcpd3 ) and by freely available software.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Holger Kruse","Kruse H","Goerigk L","Grimme S","Lars Goerigk","Stefan Grimme"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo302156p","endpage":"10834","first_seen_on":"2012-12-12T08:03:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0022-3263","1520-6904"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1496294980,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo302156p","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23153035"],"pmid":"23153035","pubdate":"2012-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"10824","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Why the Standard B3LYP\/6-31G* Model Chemistry Should Not Be Used in DFT Calculations of Molecular Thermochemistry: Understanding and Correcting the Problem","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo302156p","volume":"77","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/standard-b3lyp631g-model-chemistry-not-used-dft-calculations-molecular-thermochemistry-understanding"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.056,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.056},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":432083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7870074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295939,"mean":6.8337092363939,"rank":18183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":277756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295939,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3843,"mean":3.4418771473191,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":3810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3843,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":2.75312,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
