The Gd-tris-amidinates [Gd{(N(i)Pr)(2)CR}(3)] [R = Me (1), Et (2), (t)Bu (3), (n)Bu (4)] and [Gd{(NEt)(N(t)Bu)CMe}(3)] (5) are solids at room temperature and sublime at temperatures of about 125 \u00b0C (6 \u00d7 10(-2) mbar) with the exception of compound 4, which is a viscous liquid at room temperature. According to X-ray diffraction analysis of 3 and 5 as representative examples of the series, the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral structure in the solid state. Mass spectrometric (MS) data confirmed the monomeric structure in the gas phase, and high-resolution MS allowed the identification of characteristic fragments, such as [{(N(i)Pr)(2)CR}GdCH(3)](+) and [{(N(i)Pr)(2)CR}GdNH](+). The alkyl substitution patterns of the amidinate ligands clearly show an influence on the thermal properties, and specifically, the introduction of the asymmetric carbodiimide leads to a lowering of the onset of volatilization and decomposition. Compound 5, which is the first Gd complex with an asymmetric amidinate ligand system to be reported, was, therefore, tested for the MOCVD of GdN thin films. The as-deposited GdN films were capped with Cu in a subsequent MOCVD process to prevent postdeposition oxidation of the films. Cubic GdN on Si(100) substrates with a preferred orientation in the (200) direction were grown at 750 \u00b0C under an ammonia atmosphere and exhibited a columnar morphology and low levels of C or O impurities according to scanning electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering, and nuclear reaction analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Michael Krasnopolski","Cristian G.
