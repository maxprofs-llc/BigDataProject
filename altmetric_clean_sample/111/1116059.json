These immunogenic proteins are being vigorously pursued as targets for therapeutic cancer vaccines. CT antigens are also being evaluated for their role in oncogenesis--recapitulation of portions of the germline gene-expression programme might contribute characteristic features to the neoplastic phenotype, including immortality, invasiveness, immune evasion, hypomethylation and metastatic capacity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003168","authors":["Andrew J.
