Urine alkalinization is easily feasible in the ICU setting and is often considered to be associated with few side effects. In a previous issue of Critical Care, a retrospective study evaluates the effect of routine intravenous bicarbonate use to prevent cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury with cardiopulmonary bypass. This commentary discusses recent data on the use of bicarbonate to prevent cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","doi":"10.1186\/cc11837","first_seen_on":"2012-12-12T10:37:11+00:00","issns":["1364-8535"],"issue":"6","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1356999123,"links":["http:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/16\/6\/186\/abstract"],"pmid":"23234469","pubdate":"2012-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"186","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Sodium bicarbonate to prevent cardiac surgery-associated kidney injury: the end of a dream?","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-bicarbonate-prevent-cardiac-surgeryassociated-kidney-injury-end-dream"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3351166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285098,"mean":6.1392681297943,"rank":173431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":96715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285098,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2700,"mean":7.2329307150797,"rank":2222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2700,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":3.8105563909774,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SV":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/ICUStat\/status\/278809587526807552","citation_ids":[1119230],"posted_on":"2012-12-12T10:32:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/431292621919494144\/JFOHKDmU_normal.jpeg","description":"Native Conch currently in exile as a Nurse Intensivist in Central Florida.
