Potassium is the most abundant cation in living cells and is required for essential cellular processes, including the regulation of cell volume, pH and protein synthesis. Yeast cells can grow from low micromolar to molar potassium concentrations and utilize sophisticated control mechanisms to keep the internal potassium concentration in a viable range. We developed a mathematical model for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to explore the complex interplay between biophysical forces and molecular regulation facilitating potassium homeostasis. By using a novel inference method (\"the reverse tracking algorithm\") we predicted and then verified experimentally that the main regulators under conditions of potassium starvation are proton fluxes responding to changes of potassium concentrations. In contrast to the prevailing view, we show that regulation of the main potassium transport systems (Trk1,2 and Nha1) in the plasma membrane is not sufficient to achieve homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003349","authors":["Matthias Kahm","Clara Navarrete","Vicent Llopis-Torregrosa","Rito Herrera","Lina Barreto"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002548","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T11:16:01+00:00","issns":["1553-734X"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","last_mentioned_on":1355137470,"links":["http:\/\/www.ploscompbiol.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002548","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3380843\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3380843","pmid":"22737060","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Mathematics","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Potassium Starvation in Yeast: Mechanisms of Homeostasis Revealed by Mathematical Modeling","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potassium-starvation-yeast-mechanisms-homeostasis-revealed-mathematical-modeling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2923261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1435436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281268,"mean":5.9043335407281,"rank":176463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":92375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281268,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2889,"mean":12.03088365651,"rank":2380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2889,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":7.9688961038961,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
