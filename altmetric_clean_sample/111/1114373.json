However, the specific molecular pathways and interactions involved in this process are not completely understood. Increasing evidence indicates that a type of cell stress called endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) plays an important role in beta-cell death. In the present article, we discuss a potential paradigm of ER stress-mediated beta-cell death.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706e","doi":"10.1097\/med.0b013e3283372843","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T03:00:55+00:00","issns":["1752-296X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1355108446,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-endocrinology\/Abstract\/2010\/04000\/The_binary_switch_between_life_and_death_of.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-endocrinology\/2010\/04000\/The_binary_switch_between_life_and_death_of.2.pdf","pmid":"20125004","pubdate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"107","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"The binary switch between life and death of endoplasmic reticulum-stressed [beta] cells","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/binary-switch-between-life-death-endoplasmic-reticulumstressed-beta-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3080568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":961477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281265,"mean":5.8930954903579,"rank":192387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281265,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":570,"mean":1.7018066783831,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":570,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0384615384615,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
