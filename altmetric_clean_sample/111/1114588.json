A survey completed by 139 siblings of people with developmental disabilities captured the needs of adult siblings through 2 open-ended questions. A grounded theory approach was used, and the sibling responses anchored the analysis, interpretation of findings, and discussion using the constant comparison method. Eleven core variables and 3 overarching themes emerged. Three overarching themes for sibling support needs include: (a) getting disability-related information, (b) getting support for their caregiving role, and (c) enhancing the formal support system to address sibling needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002af4","authors":["Catherine K.
