To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. However, due to the practical complications, the availability of the final collection of samples in genomics study might be unbalanced and incomplete, which, without appropriate attention in sample-to-batch allocation, could lead to drastic batch effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective and handy tool to assign collected samples across batches in an appropriate way in order to minimize the impact of batch effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Yan L","Ma C","Wang D","Hu Q","Qin M","Conroy JM","Sucheston LE","Ambrosone CB","Johnson CS","Wang J","Liu S"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-689","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T17:32:20+00:00","funders":["nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1447353047,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/689\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/689"],"pmid":"23228338","pubdate":"2012-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"689","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"OSAT: a tool for sample-to-batch allocations in genomics experiments","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osat-tool-sampletobatch-allocations-genomics-experiments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561399,"mean":6.0801636599394,"rank":1297888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5226251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561399,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288153,"mean":6.3943151322915,"rank":66599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":220422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288153,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5160,"mean":3.9333905795697,"rank":1213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5160,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211,"mean":3.5488666666667,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
