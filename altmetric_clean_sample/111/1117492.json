The epidemiology of C difficile is changing as the ribotype 027 strain is spreading worldwide, and more infections are diagnosed in patients residing in the community. Although only few data about the epidemiology of CDI in developing countries are available, a number of reports seem to indicate that the incidence of CDI may be high in some such countries. Transmission of CDI may be more common in hospitals that lack the resources for efficient infection control programs. Theoretically, travelers to low-income countries may be exposed to C difficile both in the community and within hospitals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000cb5","authors":["Neuberger, Ami","Saadi, Tarek","Shetern, Anat","Schwartz, Eli"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1708-8305.2012.00676.x","endpage":"43","first_seen_on":"2012-12-11T15:14:37+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1708-8305","1195-1982"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Travel Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1372547009,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1708-8305.2012.00676.x\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1708-8305.2012.00676.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1708-8305.2012.00676.x\/pdf","pmid":"23279229","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Tourism","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"37","subjects":["publichealth","communicablediseases"],"title":"Clostridium difficile Infection in TravelersA Neglected Pathogen?","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clostridium-difficile-infection-travelersa-neglected-pathogen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6512089,"mean":6.0315380148408,"rank":1211917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5294051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6512089,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":6.3932778883076,"rank":62151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":225017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":3.9473311897106,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.20096,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
