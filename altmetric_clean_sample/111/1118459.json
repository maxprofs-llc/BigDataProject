How will it affect the well-being of children? Some observers worry that legalizing same-sex marriage would send the message that same-sex parenting and opposite-sex parenting are interchangeable, when in fact they may lead to different outcomes for children. To evaluate that concern, William Meezan and Jonathan Rauch review the growing body of research on how same-sex parenting affects children. After considering the methodological problems inherent in studying small, hard-to-locate populations--problems that have bedeviled this literature-the authors find that the children who have been studied are doing about as well as children normally do. What the research does not yet show is whether the children studied are typical of the general population of children raised by gay and lesbian couples. A second important question is how same-sex marriage might affect children who are already being raised by same-sex couples. Meezan and Rauch observe that marriage confers on children three types of benefits that seem likely to carry over to children in same-sex families. First, marriage may increase children's material well-being through such benefits as family leave from work and spousal health insurance eligibility. It may also help ensure financial continuity, should a spouse die or be disabled. Second, same-sex marriage may benefit children by increasing the durability and stability of their parents' relationship. Finally, marriage may bring increased social acceptance of and support for same-sex families, although those benefits might not materialize in communities that meet same-sex marriage with rejection or hostility. The authors note that the best way to ascertain the costs and benefits of the effects of same-sex marriage on children is to compare it with the alternatives. Massachusetts is marrying same-sex couples, Vermont and Connecticut are offering civil unions, and several states offer partner-benefit programs. Studying the effect of these various forms of unions on children could inform the debate over gay marriage to the benefit of all sides of the argument.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003ca9","authors":["Meezan W","Rauch J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-11T22:17:06+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Future of Children","last_mentioned_on":1355264237,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16158732"],"pmid":"16158732","pubdate":"2005-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices","pediatrics"],"title":"Gay marriage, same-sex parenting, and America's children.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gay-marriage-samesex-parenting-americas-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1592697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281343,"mean":5.9091810749905,"rank":140521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":105449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281343,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":3.5446024096386,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
