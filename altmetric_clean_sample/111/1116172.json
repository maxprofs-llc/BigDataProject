Anecdotal reports of this type of experience have most commonly occurred in individuals who have lost a limb. Distinct from phantom pain, synaesthesia for pain is triggered specifically in response to pain in another. Here, we provide the first preliminary investigation into synaesthesia for pain in amputees to determine the incidence and characteristics of this intriguing phenomenon. Self-referring amputees (n=74) answered questions on synaesthesia for pain within a broader survey of phantom pain. Of the participants, 16.2% reported that observing or imagining pain in another person triggers their phantom pain. Further understanding of synaesthesia for pain may provide a greater insight to abnormal empathic function in clinical populations as well as therapeutic intervention for at risk groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a5","authors":["Fitzgibbon, Bernadette M","Enticott, Peter G","Rich, Anina N","Giummarra, Melita J","Georgiou-Karistianis, Nellie","Tsao, Jack W","Weeks, Sharon R","Bradshaw, John L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropsychologia.2010.07.029","endpage":"3678","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T23:55:20+00:00","issns":["1873-3514","00283932"],"issue":"12","journal":"Neuropsychologia","last_mentioned_on":1427739480,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20670636"],"pmid":"20670636","pubdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"3675","subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"High incidence of 'synaesthesia for pain' in amputees.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-incidence-synaesthesia-pain-amputees"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.184,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.184},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6156308,"mean":5.9044975278162,"rank":364565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":5793820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6156308,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289167,"mean":6.2427342771973,"rank":21655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":267512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289167,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2041,"mean":5.7602588235294,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2041,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":4.5603018867925,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
