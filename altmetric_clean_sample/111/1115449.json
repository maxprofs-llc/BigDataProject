These in turn are expected to affect the physiological performance of phytoplankton. In order to learn how phytoplankton respond to the predicted scenario of increased CO(2) and decreased nitrogen in the surface mixed layer, we investigated the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a model organism. The cells were cultured in both low CO(2) (390 \u03bcatm) and high CO(2) (1000 \u03bcatm) conditions at limiting (10 \u03bcmol L(-1)) or enriched (110 \u03bcmol L(-1)) nitrate concentrations. Our study shows that nitrogen limitation resulted in significant decreases in cell size, pigmentation, growth rate and effective quantum yield of Phaeodactylum tricornutum, but these parameters were not affected by enhanced dissolved CO(2) and lowered pH. However, increased CO(2) concentration induced higher rETR(max) and higher dark respiration rates and decreased the CO(2) or dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) affinity for electron transfer (shown by higher values for K(1\/2 DIC) or K(1\/2 CO2)). Furthermore, the elemental stoichiometry (carbon to nitrogen ratio) was raised under high CO(2) conditions in both nitrogen limited and nitrogen replete conditions, with the ratio in the high CO(2) and low nitrate grown cells being higher by 45% compared to that in the low CO(2) and nitrate replete grown ones. Our results suggest that while nitrogen limitation had a greater effect than ocean acidification, the combined effects of both factors could act synergistically to affect marine diatoms and related biogeochemical cycles in future oceans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wei Li","Kunshan Gao","John Beardall","Li W","Gao K","Beardall J"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0051590","first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T17:57:24+00:00","issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1355312760,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0051590"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0051590.pdf","pmid":"23236517","pubdate":"2012-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e51590","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Interactive Effects of Ocean Acidification and Nitrogen-Limitation on the Diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interactive-effects-ocean-acidification-nitrogenlimitation-diatom-phaeodactylum-tricornutum-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.522,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.522},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":549799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3959280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281273,"mean":5.966756648369,"rank":41600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":239663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281273,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80050,"mean":8.5703742707593,"rank":13716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":66329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80050,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6479,"mean":6.6643362148811,"rank":941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6479,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
