NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is recognized as a key transcription factor of genes coding for various antioxidant and cytoprotective enzymes, and Nrf2 plays important roles during tumor progression. Recent studies have begun to explore the role of Nrf2 in tumor angiogenesis, which may be to promote the advancement of tumor antiangiogenic therapy. This article reviews the Nrf2-related pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and summarizes the possible mechanisms of Nrf2 action as a pro-angiogenic factor in tumor progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610007021","authors":["Zhou S","Ye W","Zhang M","Liang J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-12-10T21:43:39+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Critical Reviews\u0099 in Eukaryotic Gene Expression","last_mentioned_on":1355175814,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22856432?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22856432","pubdate":"2012-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"The effects of nrf2 on tumor angiogenesis: a review of the possible mechanisms of action.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-nrf2-tumor-angiogenesis-review-possible-mechanisms-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4204164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285131,"mean":6.1295598358642,"rank":235854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285131,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.7,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/278253649044574208","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1115955],"posted_on":"2012-12-10T21:43:34+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"278253649044574208"}]}}
