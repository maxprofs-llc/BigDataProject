We investigated whether self-monitoring of blood glucose could be used to assess dawn phenomenon in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods. A total of 306 people with T2DM underwent continuous glucose monitoring and self-monitoring of blood glucose for 72\u2009h. A linear model was used to fit the optimal linear formula of the magnitude of dawn phenomenon (\u0394Dawn) and self-monitoring of blood glucose values. Results. The prevalence of dawn phenomenon was similar within different oral antidiabetic drug groups (42.5%, 31.5%, and 40.9%, P = 0.216). Multiple variable linear regression showed that prebreakfast, prelunch, and predinner glucose measurements were independently and significantly correlated with \u0394Dawn. The linear formula between \u0394Dawn and blood glucose was as follows: \u0394Dawn\u2009(mg\/dL) = 0.557 \u00d7 prebreakfast - 0.065 \u00d7 prelunch - 0.164 \u00d7 predinner - 20.894\u2009(mg\/dL) (adjusted R(2) = 0.302, P = 0.000). Conclusions. Dawn phenomenon could be partly assessed by blood glucose self-monitoring in Chinese people with T2DM using the abovementioned formula. The incidence of dawn phenomenon was similar among patients in different oral antidiabetic drug groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e33","authors":["Wen Wu","Yuxin Huang","Jieyuzhen Qiu","Jiao Sun","Haidong Wang"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/7174958","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T15:57:12+00:00","issns":["1687-8337","1687-8345"],"journal":"International Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1501026002,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28421112"],"pmcid":"PMC5379129","pmid":"28421112","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose to Assess Dawn Phenomenon in Chinese People with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfmonitoring-blood-glucose-assess-dawn-phenomenon-chinese-people-type-2-diabetes-mellitus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272105,"mean":6.9807941447478,"rank":6275979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1118428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272105,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168933,"mean":11.527597423816,"rank":118720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168933,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":459,"mean":3.6173537117904,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":459,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CaloriesProper\/statuses\/889993678529249282","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22496229],"posted_on":"2017-07-25T23:40:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Bill Lagakos","url":"http:\/\/caloriesproper.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/740718720864026624\/l4EWWpyw_normal.jpg","description":"Ph.D. Nutritional Biochemistry & Physiology.
