Hypoxia inducible factor-l\u03b1 (HIF-l\u03b1) is a major transcriptional regulator of cellular adaptations to hypoxic stress. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as posttranscriptional gene expression regulators occupy a crucial role in cell survival under low-oxygen environment. Previous evidences suggested that miR-125c is involved in hypoxia adaptation, but its precise biological roles and the regulatory mechanism underlying hypoxic responses remain unknown. The present study showed that zebrafish miR-125c is upregulated by hypoxia in a Hif-l\u03b1-mediated manner in vitro and in vivo. Dual-luciferase assay revealed that cdc25a is a novel target of miR-125c. An inverse correlation between miR-125c and cdc25a was further confirmed in vivo, suggesting miR-125c as a crucial physiological inhibitor of cdc25a which responds to cellular hypoxia. Overexpression of miR-125c suppressed cell proliferation, led to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in ZF4 cells and induced apoptotic responses during embryo development. More importantly, miR-125c overexpression resulted in severe malformation and reduction of motility during zebrafish embryonic development. Taken together, we conclude that miR-125c plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptations to hypoxic stress at least in part through the Hif-1\u03b1\/miR-125c\/cdc25a signaling and has great impact on zebrafish early embryonic development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Yan He","Chun-Xiao Huang","Nan Chen","Meng Wu","Yan Huang","Hong Liu","Rong Tang","Wei-Min Wang","Huan-Ling Wang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.17994","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T21:30:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1496960523,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28589898?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28589898","pubdate":"2017-06-08T22:05:36+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The zebrafish miR-125c is induced under hypoxic stress <i>via<\/i> hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 and functions in cellular adaptations and embryogenesis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zebrafish-mir125c-induced-under-hypoxic-stress-via-hypoxiainducible-factor-1%CE%B1-functions-cellular-ada"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6326362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1128715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241579,"mean":12.503068979791,"rank":170862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241579,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8840,"mean":3.1698511143795,"rank":4292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8840,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1081,"mean":3.8974259259259,"rank":486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1081,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/872928756360282112","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20917682],"posted_on":"2017-06-08T21:30:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":409},"tweet_id":"872928756360282112"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/872941824054185984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20917682],"posted_on":"2017-06-08T22:22:03+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
