The patients were dichotomized according to age <80 years (n=421; mean age 69 years, 292 men; group 1) or \u226580 years (n=221; mean age 85 years, 113 men; group 2). The groups had similar distributions in Rutherford categories 4 to 6, but group 1 had more men, smokers, diabetics, and patients on dialysis. The primary composite endpoint of the study was amputation and\/or death. Key secondary endpoints were in-hospital mortality and major amputation, as well as major adverse limb events (MALE; any reintervention or major amputation involving the index limb) at 1 year.\nThe in-hospital mortality was 1% in group 1 and 2% in group 2 (p=0.204) and the major amputation rates were 4% and 2% (p=0.169), respectively. Amputation-free survival at 1 year was 75% in group 1 and 77% in group 2 (p=0.340), whereas freedom from MALE was significantly different between the groups [62% group 1 vs 72% group 2; hazard ratio (HR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.93, p=0.016). Limb salvage was 90% in group 1 and 95% in group 2 (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.69, p=0.01).\nOctogenarians with CLI treated by endovascular means showed comparable early and 1-year amputation-free survival rates vs their younger counterparts, and limb salvage and freedom from MALE rates were even higher in octogenarians.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a2f","authors":["Christian Uhl","Markus Steinbauer","Giovanni Torsello","Theodosios Bisdas"],"doi":"10.1177\/1526602817711424","first_seen_on":"2017-06-08T19:03:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-6028","1545-1550"],"journal":"Journal of Endovascular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1496948554,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1526602817711424"],"pmid":"28578624","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage CA: Los Angeles, CA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Outcomes After Endovascular Revascularization in Octogenarians and Non-Octogenarians With Critical Limb Ischemia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-after-endovascular-revascularization-octogenarians-nonoctogenarians-critical-limb-ischemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":1217174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7044149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241577,"mean":12.503222580057,"rank":50348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":189404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241577,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.3699468438538,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.3875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
