Its long time limit is an order parameter for the localization transition, which is readily accessible by standard experimental probes in magnets. We analytically calculate its value in the strong-disorder regime exploiting the explicit construction of quasilocal conserved quantities of the localized phase. We discuss analogies in cold atomic systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["V. Ros","M.
