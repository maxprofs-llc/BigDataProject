The activation barriers for reorientation of the methyl group in amorphous diazepam were found in the range of 1.9 kJ\/mol to 12.7 kJ\/mol. Atom-atom calculations permitted determination of the distribution of energy barriers for reorientations of methyl groups, which was in a good agreement with that obtained on the basis of experimental data. The NMR relaxation combined with calculations provided a quantitative description of the distribution of energy barriers including intra- and intermolecular interactions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["A.
