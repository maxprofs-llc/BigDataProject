Mean (SD) age was 67.5 (17.3) years, 52% were female. The most common reasons for consultation were symptom management (33%) and end-of-life transition (24%). Adherence to ICU quality metrics for palliative care was variable: clinicians documented presence or absence of advance directives in 36% of encounters, assessed pain in 52.0%, dyspnea in 50.8%, spiritual support in 62%, and reported an intervention for pain in 100% of patients with documented moderate to severe intensity pain.\nPalliative care consultations in an ICU setting are characterized by variable adherence to candidate ICU palliative care quality metrics. While symptom management was the most common reason for PC consultation, consultants infrequently documented symptom assessments. Palliative care consultants performed better in offering spiritual support and managing documented symptoms. These results highlight specific competencies of consultative palliative care that should be complimented by ICU teams to ensure high quality comprehensive care for the critically ill.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea6","authors":["Wysham, Nicholas G","Hochman, Michael J","Wolf, Steven P","Cox, Christopher E","Kamal, Arif H","Nicholas G.
