We have generated a group of high-affinity mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting GPC3. Here, we report the humanization and testing of these antibodies for clinical development. We compared the affinity and cytotoxicity of recombinant immunotoxins containing mouse single-chain variable regions fused with a Pseudomonas toxin. To humanize the mouse Fvs, we grafted the combined KABAT\/IMGT complementarity determining regions (CDR) into a human IgG germline framework. Interestingly, we found that the proline at position 41, a non-CDR residue in heavy chain variable regions (VH), is important for humanization of mouse antibodies. We also showed that two humanized anti-GPC3 antibodies (hYP7 and hYP9.1b) in the IgG format induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent-cytotoxicity in GPC3-positive cancer cells. The hYP7 antibody was tested and showed inhibition of HCC xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. This study successfully humanizes and validates high affinity anti-GPC3 antibodies and sets a foundation for future development of these antibodies in various clinical formats in the treatment of liver cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yi-Fan Zhang","Mitchell Ho"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep33878","first_seen_on":"2016-10-05T19:40:40+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1475696427,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep33878"],"pmid":"27667400","pubdate":"2016-09-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Protein design","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular biology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"33878","subjects":["science"],"title":"Humanization of high-affinity antibodies targeting glypican-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/humanization-highaffinity-antibodies-targeting-glypican3-hepatocellular-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":3639881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3654719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239586,"mean":12.521970123338,"rank":121223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":109597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239586,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28390,"mean":14.744432914157,"rank":15444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":11696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28390,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2961,"mean":16.219573648649,"rank":1662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2961,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
