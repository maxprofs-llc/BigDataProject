Active learning text classification is a supervised machine learning approach that has been shown to significantly reduce the manual annotation workload by semi-automating the citation screening process of systematic reviews. In this paper, we present a new topic detection method that induces an informative representation of studies, to improve the performance of the underlying active learner. Our proposed topic detection method uses a neural network-based vector space model to capture semantic similarities between documents. We firstly represent documents within the vector space, and cluster the documents into a predefined number of clusters. The centroids of the clusters are treated as latent topics. We then represent each document as a mixture of latent topics. For evaluation purposes, we employ the active learning strategy using both our novel topic detection method and a baseline topic model (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Results obtained demonstrate that our method is able to achieve a high sensitivity of eligible studies and a significantly reduced manual annotation cost when compared to the baseline method. This observation is consistent across two clinical and three public health reviews.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6213cf058f610007b98","authors":["Hashimoto, Kazuma","Kontonatsios, Georgios","Miwa, Makoto","Ananiadou, Sophia","Kazuma Hashimoto","Georgios Kontonatsios","Makoto Miwa","Sophia Ananiadou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbi.2016.06.001","endpage":"65","first_seen_on":"2016-10-05T20:58:52+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1532-0480","15320464"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1479922252,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1532046416300442"],"pmid":"27293211","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Topic detection using paragraph vectors to support active learning in systematic reviews","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1532046416300442","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topic-detection-using-paragraph-vectors-support-active-learning-systematic-reviews"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":1884762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4817228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244522,"mean":12.53369434936,"rank":82348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":158811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244522,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":3.1446481927711,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.1472972972973,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
