The Tenm protein is found in seven stripes during the blastoderm stage, and each stripe overlaps with the even-skipped stripes. tenm mutants show a phenotype resembling that of odd-paired (opa), a member of the pair-rule class of segmentation genes. Thus, Tenm is the first example of a pair-rule gene product acting from outside the cell. While the Tenm protein is under the control of fushi tarazu and even-skipped, but not of opa, at least two pair-rule genes, paired (prd) and sloppy paired (slp), and all segment-polarity genes analysed to date are under the control of tenm. Our data suggest that Tenm initiates a signal transduction cascade which acts, via or in concert with opa, on downstream targets such as prd, slp, gooseberry, engrailed and wingless, leading to an opa-like phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["S Baumgartner","D Martin","C Hagios","R Chiquet-Ehrismann"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T09:56:27+00:00","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"16","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1288473878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8070401","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC395283"],"pmcid":"PMC395283","pmid":"8070401","pubdate":"1994-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Tenm, a Drosophila gene related to tenascin, is a new pair-rule gene.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tenm-drosophila-gene-related-tenascin-new-pairrule-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627006,"mean":4.9509722374284,"rank":817803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627006,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93557,"mean":8.0185441233059,"rank":24100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93557,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.2018149074537,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":7.5704545454545,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
