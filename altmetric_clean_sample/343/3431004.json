As has been previously observed, the widely used RMSD measure due to Kabsch, in which a rigid-body superposition minimising the least-squares positional deviations is performed, has its drawbacks when comparing and visualising a set of flexible proteins structures. Here, we develop a method, fleximatch, of protein structure comparison that takes flexibility into account. Based on a distance matrix measure of flexibility, a weighted superposition of distance matrices rather than of atomic coordinates is performed. Subsequently, this allows a consistent determination of a) a superposition of structures for visualisation b) a partitioning of the protein structure into rigid molecular components (core atoms) and c) an atomic mobility measure. The method is suitable for highlighting both particularly flexible and rigid parts of a protein from structures derived from NMR, X-ray diffraction or molecular simulation.
