A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted. The cases were patients newly diagnosed with glaucoma from 2001 to 2010. The controls were randomly selected non-glaucoma subjects matched by sex and age (\u00b15 years). Zolpidem exposure and\/or the average dosage of zolpidem used (mg\/year) were evaluated. Medical comorbidities were considered as confounding factors. Multiple logistic regression models were used to evaluate the potential risk of zolpidem exposure on glaucoma with\/without adjustment for the effects of confounding variables.Results: The exposure rate of zolpidem use in the glaucoma group was significantly higher than that of the control group (2.8% vs. 2.0%, P < 0.0001). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of the risk of glaucoma for those with zolpidem use vs. those without was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.38). Compared to non-zolpidem users, zolpidem users with an average dose of more than 200 mg\/year had significantly increased risk of glaucoma (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.03-1.68).Conclusions: This study suggests that the use of zolpidem might increase the risk of subsequent glaucoma. Further confirmatory studies are recommended to clarify this important issue.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa85f3cf058f61000c5c3","authors":["Ho YH","Chang YC","Huang WC","Chen
