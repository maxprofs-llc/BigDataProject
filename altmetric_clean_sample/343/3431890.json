The 382 restraints derived from the NMR experiments were used to calculate many distance geometry structures, which were then refined by restrained molecular mechanics. Five of these structures were further refined using a variety of methods. Comparison of independently measured parameters, such as calculated hydrogen bonding patterns and experimental amide exchange rates, have been used to evaluate the accuracy of the structures. Also, possible mechanisms to explain the pH-dependent conformational interconversion observed are suggested. Finally comparisons between this work and others on this topic have been made.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002820","authors":["T S Harvey","A J Wilkinson","M J Tappin","R M Cooke","I D Campbell","Harvey, T S","Wilkinson, A J","Tappin, M J","Cooke, R M","Campbell, I D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T09:24:10+00:00","issns":["0014-2956"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1202417363,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2050136"],"pmid":"2050136","pubdate":"1991-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The solution structure of human transforming growth factor alpha.","type":"article","volume":"198","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solution-structure-human-transforming-growth-factor-alpha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4680920,"mean":5.6987154988182,"rank":1130499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2961917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4680920,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162244,"mean":8.9288441165414,"rank":48066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":112000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162244,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2396,"mean":3.0350981210856,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2396,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"TGF alpha","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=189804091#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3431887,3431890],"posted_on":"2008-02-07T20:49:23+00:00","summary":"Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-\u03b1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TGFA gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=9506574","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
