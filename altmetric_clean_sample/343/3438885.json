Recent studies report that high-mobility group A2 is negatively regulated by the let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) family in vitro. The development of pituitary adenomas in high-mobility group A2 transgenic mice showed that high-mobility group A2 may be involved in pituitary tumorigenesis. However, no studies have investigated the clinical significance of high-mobility group A2 and its relationship to the let-7 miRNA family in human pituitary adenomas. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed high-mobility group A2 expression with respect to various clinicopathologic factors in 98 pituitary adenomas. Overexpression of high-mobility group A2 was observed in 39% (38\/98) of pituitary adenomas compared with normal adenohypophysial tissue and was frequently found in adenomas including prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone\/luteinizing hormone and in null cell adenomas, but relatively rare in growth hormone (GH) and mixed GH\/PRL adenomas. High-mobility group A2 expression was significantly associated with tumor invasion (P<0.05) and was significantly higher in grade IV than in grades I, II, and III adenomas (P<0.05). High levels of high-mobility group A2 expression were more frequently observed in macroadenomas than in microadenomas (P<0.05). High levels of high-mobility group A2 expression also significantly correlated with the proliferation marker Ki-67 (P<0.0001). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out to evaluate the expression of let-7 in 55 pituitary adenomas. Subsequently, decreased expression of let-7 was confirmed in 23 of 55 (42%) adenomas and was correlated with high-grade tumors (P<0.05). An inverse correlation between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 expression was evident (R=-0.33, P<0.05). These findings support a causal link between let-7 and high-mobility group A2 whereby loss of let-7 expression induces high-mobility group A2 upregulation that represents an important mechanism in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eb7","authors":["Zhi Rong Qian","Zhi Rong Qian","Sylvia L Asa","Haruhiko Siomi","Mikiko C Siomi","Katsuhiko Yoshimoto","Shozo Yamada","Elaine Lu Wang","Md Mustafizur Rahman","Hiroshi Inoue","Mitsuo Itakura","Eiji Kudo","Toshiaki Sano"],"doi":"10.1038\/modpathol.2008.202","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T10:51:37+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Modern Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1290284041,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/modpathol.2008.202","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19136928"],"pmid":"19136928","pubdate":"2009-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Overexpression of HMGA2 relates to reduction of the let-7 and its relationship to clinicopathological features in pituitary adenomas.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-hmga2-relates-reduction-let7-relationship-clinicopathological-features-pituitary-aden"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1037577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2908305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151658,"mean":8.8873868004778,"rank":44191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":105578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151658,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":871,"mean":4.0306620689655,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":871,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":15.301304347826,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
