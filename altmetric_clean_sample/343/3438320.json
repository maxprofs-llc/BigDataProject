Many of the signal transduction pathways that control these cellular decisions are activated by elevation of intracellular calcium. Recent studies have revealed a central role for the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors in linking calcium-dependent signaling pathways to the genes responsible for cell division, differentiation and death. This article describes the post-translational mechanisms that confer calcium-sensitivity to MEF2 and its downstream target genes, and considers how this transcription factor can control diverse and mutually exclusive cellular decisions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a4","authors":["Timothy A McKinsey","Chun Li Zhang","Eric N Olson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T10:30:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0968-0004"],"issue":"1","journal":"Trends in Biochemical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1188161893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11796223"],"pmid":"11796223","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"MEF2: a calcium-dependent regulator of cell division, differentiation and death.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mef2-calciumdependent-regulator-cell-division-differentiation-death"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":817357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94508,"mean":8.1352773656979,"rank":24503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94508,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":921,"mean":3.3246065217391,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":921,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.5666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
