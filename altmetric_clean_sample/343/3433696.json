Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index measured by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), has been shown to be exceedingly sensitive to microstructural damage in brain white matter tracts. It is hypothesized that pre-operative white matter damage is more extensive in PAD patients scheduled for vascular surgery who experience an adverse long-term outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007376","authors":["Virtanen S","Utriainen KT","Parkkola R","Airaksinen JK","Laitio R","Scheinin H","Hakovirta H","Laitio TT"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejvs.2014.08.025","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T11:24:58+00:00","issns":["1078-5884"],"issue":"6","journal":"European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1424786771,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25544158?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ejves.com\/article\/S1078-5884(14)00505-X\/abstract"],"pmid":"25544158","pubdate":"2014-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"White Matter Damage of the Brain is Associated with Poor Outcome in Vascular Surgery Patients with Claudication: A Pilot Study","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/white-matter-damage-brain-associated-poor-outcome-vascular-surgery-patients-claudication-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4800224,"mean":5.7435569789187,"rank":3400213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":781450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4800224,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170197,"mean":8.6996740933984,"rank":118516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":33102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170197,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":1.7541867219917,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.3316455696203,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/status\/564018616501534720","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3433696],"posted_on":"2015-02-07T11:11:31+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"564018616501534720"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/painmanwise\/status\/564020465124270080","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3433696],"posted_on":"2015-02-07T11:18:52+00:00","author":{"name":"painmanwise","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/514094062056390656\/ORtXawZi_normal.png","id_on_source":"painmanwise","tweeter_id":"2826634074","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":129},"tweet_id":"564020465124270080"}],"facebook":[{"title":"White Matter Damage of the Brain is Associated with Poor Outcome in Vascular Surgery Patients...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=797268980320469&id=754691544578213","license":"public","citation_ids":[3433696],"posted_on":"2015-02-24T14:06:11+00:00","summary":"\"It is hypothesized that pre-operative white matter damage is more extensive in PAD [peripheral arterial disease] patients scheduled for vascular surgery who experience an adverse long-term outcome.\"","author":{"name":"Western Vascular Institute","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/754691544578213","facebook_wall_name":"Western Vascular Institute","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/754691544578213\/picture","id_on_source":"754691544578213"}}]}}
