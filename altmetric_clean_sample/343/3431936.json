Several findings underscore the apparent driver role of BAP1 in malignant mesothelioma (MM). However, the reported frequency of somatic BAP1 mutations in MM varies considerably, a discrepancy that appeared related to either methodological or ethnical differences across various studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efc","authors":["Nasu M","Emi M","Pastorino S","Tanji M","Powers A","Baumann F","Zhang YA","Gazdar A","Kanodia S","Tiirikainen M","Flores E","Gaudino G","Becich MJ","Pass HI","Yang H","Carbone M","Masaki Nasu","Mitsuru Emi","Sandra Pastorino","Mika Tanji","Amy Powers","Hugh Luk","Francine Baumann","Yu-an Zhang","Adi Gazdar","Shreya Kanodia","Maarit Tiirikainen","Erin Flores","Giovanni Gaudino","Michael J.
