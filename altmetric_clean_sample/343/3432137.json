We found elevated levels of cholesta-8,14-dien-3beta-ol in cultured skin fibroblasts of an 18-wk-old fetus with HEM, compatible with a deficiency of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(14)-reductase. Sequence analysis of two candidate genes encoding putative human sterol delta(14)-reductases (TM7SF2 and LBR) identified a homozygous 1599-1605TCTTCTA-->CTAGAAG substitution in exon 13 of the LBR gene encoding the lamin B receptor, which results in a truncated protein. Functional complementation of the HEM cells by transfection with control LBR cDNA confirmed that LBR encoded the defective sterol delta(14)-reductase. Mutations in LBR recently have been reported also to cause Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly, an autosomal dominant trait characterized by hypolobulated nuclei and abnormal chromatin structure in granulocytes. The fact that the healthy mother of the fetus showed hypolobulated nuclei in 60% of her granulocytes confirms that classic Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly represents the heterozygous state of 3beta-hydroxysterol delta(14)-reductase deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Waterham, Hans R","Koster, Janet","Mooyer, Petra","Noort Gv, Gerard van","Kelley, Richard I","Wilcox, William R","Wanders, Ronald J A","Hennekam, Raoul C M","Oosterwijk, Jan C"],"doi":"10.1086\/373938","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T09:33:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-9297"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1212849103,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1086\/373938","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12618959","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1180330"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S0002929707606223\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC1180330","pmid":"12618959","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Autosomal Recessive HEM\/Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia Is Caused by 3\u03b2-Hydroxysterol \u039414-Reductase Deficiency Due to Mutations in the Lamin B Receptor Gene","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autosomal-recessive-hemgreenberg-skeletal-dysplasia-caused-3%CE%B2hydroxysterol-%CE%B414reductase-deficiency-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":816180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94309,"mean":8.1144156805363,"rank":24425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94309,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2911,"mean":6.3571896907216,"rank":914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2911,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.15,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
