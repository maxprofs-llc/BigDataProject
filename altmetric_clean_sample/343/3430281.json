The H-phosphonate salts (4a-e), in the presence of pivaloyl chloride or adamantoyl chloride as an activator, were coupled to the 5'-end of synthetic oligonucleotides on solid supports to produce amino or thio-linked oligonucleotides. Following deprotection and purification, fluorescent dyes, biotin derivatives and poly-L-lysine-maleimide were separately attached to the functionalised oligonucleotides. Identical derivatized oligomers were obtained with cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylamidite chemistry and amidites (5a-e) of the respective alcohols.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["N.D.
