Patients were evaluated before treatment, after 1 month of therapy (1,000 mg daily), and 1 month after the last dose. Ten patients improved on at least one of three methods of evaluation. Transient side effects were common, possibly because there was a high percentage of \"slow acetylators\"; dosage was reduced by one-half in five patients. Improvement was mild and did not result in significant functional improvement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Pierre Duquette","Juliana Pleines","Patrick du Souich"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.35.12.1772","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T10:01:55+00:00","issns":["1526-632X","0028-3878"],"journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1179590170,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1212\/wnl.35.12.1772","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3906430"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/35\/12\/1772.full.pdf","pmid":"3906430","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Isoniazid for tremor in multiple sclerosis: a controlled trial.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isoniazid-tremor-multiple-sclerosis-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9277809930899,"rank":815405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92825,"mean":7.2113779195036,"rank":23528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92825,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5918,"mean":7.7013902315363,"rank":1910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5918,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":13.449910447761,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=132022203#altmetric_citation_27","license":"public","citation_ids":[3437541],"posted_on":"2007-05-19T15:56:10+00:00","summary":"Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms: changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, or difficulty moving; difficulties with coordination and balance; problems in speech (dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), v","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=11017081","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Garrondo","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Garrondo"}}]}}
