Yeasts thus provide attractive platforms for the production of recombinant proteins. Here, four important species are presented and compared: the methylotrophic Hansenula polymorpha and Pichia pastoris, distinguished by an increasingly large track record as industrial platforms, and the dimorphic species Arxula adeninivorans and Yarrrowia lipolytica, not yet established as industrial platforms, but demonstrating promising technological potential, as discussed in this article.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c6","authors":["Gerd Gellissen","Gotthard Kunze","Claude Gaillardin","James M.
