However, the patients take risks of sedation or anesthesia. There are several techniques of reduction that reduce the dislocation without using sedation or anesthesia such as Milch technique, gentle traction, abduction and external rotation (TAE) technique and scapular manipulation. In the present study, the authors compared efficacy of reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocation by using TAE without sedation and TCT techniques under conscious sedation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcfc","authors":["Harnroongroj T","Wangphanich J","Harnroongroj T"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T10:28:02+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand Chotmaihet thangphaet","last_mentioned_on":1407117978,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22295736"],"pmid":"22295736","pubdate":"2012-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Efficacy of gentle traction, abduction and external rotation maneuver under sedative-free for reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocation: retrospective comparative study.","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-gentle-traction-abduction-external-rotation-maneuver-under-sedativefree-reduction-acute-ant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4104392,"mean":5.1033324784805,"rank":954472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2587691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4104392,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129921,"mean":9.0816068503697,"rank":39847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":88244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129921,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":363,"mean":1.7785580110497,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":363,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.3105263157895,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
