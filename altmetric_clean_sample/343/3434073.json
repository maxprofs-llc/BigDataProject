Methods:A total of 870 young male subjects aged 21.63 \u00b1 1.15 years were recruited from the Singapore military. Choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). PPCT was manually measured at 8 locations around optic disc. Results:We analyzed 448 subjects with high myopia (defined as spherical equivalent [SE] worse than -6.0 D) and 116 with emmetropia (SE >-0.5 and <1.0 D). The mean SE was -8.52 \u00b1 1.20 D for high myopic group, and 0.11 \u00b1 0.24 D for emmetropic group. The mean peripapillary choroid was significantly thinner (142.62 \u00b1 43.84 \u00b5m) in high myopes compared to emmetropes (181.90 \u00b1 46.43 \u00b5m, p<0.001). Likewise, PPCT showed further decrease with increase in degree of myopic refractive error. Distribution of PPCT showed a markedly different pattern in high myopic eyes (thickest superiorly) and emmetropic eyes (thickest temporally). However, peripapillary choroid in both the groups was thinnest at the inferior location. Among the ocular factors studied, axial length, intra ocular pressure, presence of posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy were the factors significantly associated with PPCT. Conclusions:Highly myopic eyes have significantly thinner peripapillary choroid and showed different distribution of thickness, compared to emmetropes. Axial length, intra ocular pressure and presence of posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy significantly influence PPCT and should be taken into consideration during clinical interpretation of PPCT measurement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Preeti Gupta","Carol Yim-Lui Cheung","Seang-Mei Saw","Mayuri Bhargava","Colin S H Tan","Mellisa Tan","Adeline Yang","Frederick Tey","Gerard Nah","Paul Zhao","Tien Y Wong","Ching-Yu Cheng","P.
