Adverse cosmesis was defined as a score of fair or poor. Cosmetic deterioration was defined as any adverse change in score from baseline to 3\u00a0years. The analysis is based on data from the previously reported interim analysis. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of\u00a0risk factors for these outcomes among all patients and those treated with APBI only.\nClinicopathologic characteristics were similar between subjects randomized to APBI (n=569) or whole-breast irradiation (n=539). For all subjects, factors associated with adverse cosmesis at 3\u00a0years were older age, central\/inner tumor location, breast infection, smoking, seroma volume, breast volume, and use of APBI; factors associated with cosmetic deterioration were smoking, seroma volume, and use of APBI (P<.05). For APBI subjects, tumor location, smoking, age, and seroma volume were associated with adverse cosmesis (P<.05), and smoking was associated with cosmetic deterioration (P=.02). An independent association between the V95\/whole-breast volume ratio and adverse cosmesis (P=.28) or cosmetic deterioration (P=.07) was not detected. On further exploration a V95\/whole-breast volume ratio <0.15 was associated with a lower risk of cosmetic deterioration (p=.04), but this accounted for only 11% of patients.\nIn the RAPID trial, a number of patient tumor and treatment-related factors, including the use of APBI, were associated with adverse cosmesis and cosmetic deterioration. For patients treated with APBI alone, the high-dose treatment volume was not independently associated with an adverse cosmetic outcome, and a useful clinical threshold could not be identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Peterson, David","Truong, Pauline T","Parpia, Sameer","Olivotto, Ivo A","Berrang, Tanya","Kim, Do-Hoon","Kong, Iwa","Germain, Isabelle","Nichol, Alan","Akra, Mohamed","Roy, Isabelle","Reed, Melanie","Fyles, Anthony","Trotter, Theresa","Perera, Francisco","Balkwill, Susan","Lavertu, Sophie","Elliott, Elizabeth","Julian, Jim A","Levine, Mark N","Whelan, Timothy J",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijrobp.2014.12.040","first_seen_on":"2015-02-08T10:14:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0360-3016","1879-355X"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics","last_mentioned_on":1423423234,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redjournal.org%2Farticle%2FS0360-3016%252814%252904540-4%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=rob-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.redjournal.org\/article\/S0360301614045404\/pdf","pmid":"25832689","pubdate":"2015-04-03T22:08:06+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["radiology","neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Predictors of Adverse Cosmetic Outcome in the RAPID Trial: An Exploratory Analysis","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-adverse-cosmetic-outcome-rapid-trial-exploratory-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4728273,"mean":5.7012211078408,"rank":2349410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2236761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4728273,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165939,"mean":8.8416062866857,"rank":79216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":79016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165939,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3454,"mean":1.8650008688097,"rank":978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3454,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282,"mean":2.5591814946619,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
