Both gp120 (envelope glycoprotein) and Nef (regulatory protein) have been correlated with the development of AIDS disease in independent studies. In this context, the ability of HIV-1 to utilize immature dentritic cells for transfer of virus is pivotal for early pathogenesis. The presence of C-type lectins on dendritic cells (DCs) like DC-SIGN, are crucial in inducing antiviral immunity to HIV-1. Both gp120 and Nef induce the release of cytokines leading to multiple effects of viral pathogenesis. Our study elucidated for the first time the cross-talk of the signaling mechanism of these two viral proteins in immature monocyte derived dentritic cells (immDCs). Further, gp120 was found to downregulate the IL-6 release by Nef, depending on the interaction with DC-SIGN. A cascade of signaling followed thereafter, including the activation of SOCS-3, to mediate the diminishing effect of gp120. Our results also revealed that the anti-apoptotic signals emanated from Nef was put to halt by gp120 through inhibition of Nef induced STAT3. Thus our results implicate that the signaling generated by gp120 and Nef, undergoes a switch-over mechanism that significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 and widens our view towards the approach on battling the viral infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sarkar R","Mitra D","Chakrabarti S"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0059073","first_seen_on":"2015-02-08T17:27:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1423416423,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23554973"],"pmid":"23554973","pubdate":"2013-04-05T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"HIV-1 Gp120 Protein Downregulates Nef Induced IL-6 Release in Immature Dentritic Cells through Interplay of DC-SIGN.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv1-gp120-protein-downregulates-nef-induced-il6-release-immature-dentritic-cells-through-interplay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4728273,"mean":5.7012211078408,"rank":2513760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1570772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4728273,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165944,"mean":8.8433563814084,"rank":87929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":57615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165944,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84262,"mean":9.014224659095,"rank":48167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":25867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84262,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2502,"mean":10.674369452219,"rank":1537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2502,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
