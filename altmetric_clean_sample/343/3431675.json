The polysaccharide is regarded as the major bioactive substances in G. atrum. To delineate the underlying mechanism and signaling cascade involved in the immunomodulatory property of G. atrum polysaccharide (PSG-1). Specifically, this study is designed to examine the possibility of TLR4 as a candidate receptor interacted with G. atrum polysaccharide (PSG-1) and elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PSG-1-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) production during macrophage activation. Flow cytometric and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analysis showed that fluorescence-labeled PSG-1 bind specifically to the macrophages. Moreover, PSG-1 stimulated TNF-\u03b1 secretion of peritoneal macrophages from C3H\/HeN mice, but not from C3H\/HeJ mice. PSG-1-indcued TNF-\u03b1 production was suppressed by anti-TLR4 mAb. Furthermore, ROS production was mediated by TLR4, and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS act as upstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)\/Akt\/mitogen-activated protein kinases(MAPKs)\/nuclear factor(NF)-\u03baB signaling pathway in the regulation of PSG-1 stimulated TNF-\u03b1 production. Taken together, we conclude that PSG-1 induces TNF-\u03b1 secretion through TLR4\/ROS\/PI3K\/Akt\/MAPKs\/NF-\u03baB pathways during macrophage activation. Our findings provide a molecular basis for the potential of PSG-1 as a novel immunomodulatory agent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Yu Q","Nie SP","Wang JQ","Yin PF","Huang DF","Li WJ","Xie MY"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2014.01.018","first_seen_on":"2015-02-07T09:15:27+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1423300444,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24447977?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24447977","pubdate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Toll-like receptor 4-mediated ROS signaling pathway involved in Ganoderma atrum polysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 secretion during macrophage activation.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tolllike-receptor-4mediated-ros-signaling-pathway-involved-ganoderma-atrum-polysaccharideinduced-tum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724476,"mean":5.6951346649109,"rank":3956493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724476,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165267,"mean":8.7922499485681,"rank":133175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165267,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1363,"mean":6.7297738619677,"rank":1114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1363,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.3,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
