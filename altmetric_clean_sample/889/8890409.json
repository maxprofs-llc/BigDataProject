Incident global radiation comprises two main components; direct radiation from the direction of the sun, and diffuse radiation, which is sunlight scattered by molecules, aerosols and clouds. Both irradiance and photon flux density spectra differ between direct and diffuse radiation in their magnitude and profile. However, most research has assumed that the spectra of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be averaged, without considering the radiation classes. We used paired spectroradiometers to sample direct and diffuse solar radiation, and obtained relationships between the PAR spectra and the absorption spectra of photosynthetic pigments and organs. As monomers in solvent, the spectral absorbance of Chl a decreased with the increased spectral irradiance (W\u00a0m(-2)\u00a0nm(-1)) of global PAR at noon (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.76), and was suitable to avoid strong spectral irradiance (\u03bbmax\u00a0=\u00a0480\u00a0nm) rather than absorb photon flux density (\u03bcmol\u00a0m(-2)\u00a0s(-1)\u00a0nm(-1)) efficiently. The spectral absorption of photosystems and the intact thallus and leaves decreased linearly with the increased spectral irradiance of direct PAR at noon (I dir-max), where the wavelength was within the 450-650\u00a0nm range (R(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.81). The higher-order structure of photosystems systematically avoided the strong spectral irradiance of I dir-max. However, when whole leaves were considered, leaf anatomical structure and light scattering in leaf tissues made the leaves grey bodies for PAR and enabled high PAR use efficiency. Terrestrial green plants are fine-tuned to spectral dynamics of incident solar radiation and PAR absorption is increased in various structural hierarchies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ed2","authors":["Atsushi Kume","Tomoko Akitsu","Kenlo Nishida Nasahara"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10265-016-0809-0","endpage":"624","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T05:24:37+00:00","issns":["1618-0860"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Plant Research","last_mentioned_on":1492403282,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10265-016-0809-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10265-016-0809-0.pdf","pmid":"26943164","pubdate":"2016-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"615","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Leaf color is fine-tuned on the solar spectra to avoid strand direct solar radiation","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leaf-color-finetuned-solar-spectra-avoid-strand-direct-solar-radiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078137,"mean":6.8589454589436,"rank":5848273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1943233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078137,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263666,"mean":11.629093721199,"rank":168586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":79797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263666,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":306,"mean":2.2962032786885,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":306,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1961538461538,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
