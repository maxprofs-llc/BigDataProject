Only prospective studies reporting on regular-diameter (\u22653\u00a0mm), micro-rough surface implants were included in this review. Two investigators performed the search and data extraction. An inter-investigator reliability was verified using kappa statistics (\u03ba). A meta-analysis was performed on implant survival rates, while the mean peri-implant marginal bone level changes (PI-MBL), technical\/mechanical complications, and biological complications were reported descriptively.\nThe systematic search yielded 2221 publications, of which 11 studies were included for statistical analyses. The calculated \u03ba for the various parameters extracted was \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.818-1.000. A meta-analysis was performed on the post-loading implant survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10\u00a0years. The random-effects model revealed an overall 1-year implant survival of 97.7% (95% CI: 95.8, 98.8; I(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.00%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.968; n\u00a0=\u00a011 studies). The model further revealed an overall implant survival of 96.3% (95% CI: 92.8, 98.1; I(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.00%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.618; n\u00a0=\u00a06 studies), 96.2% (95% CI: 93.0, 97.9; I(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.00%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.850; n\u00a0=\u00a07 studies), and 91.2% (95% CI: 83.4, 95.6; I(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.00%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.381; n\u00a0=\u00a03 studies) for 3, 5, and 10\u00a0years, respectively. The reported 1-year average PI-MBL ranged between 0.1 and 0.3\u00a0mm, while the reported 5- and 10-year PI-MBL were 0.7 and 1.5\u00a0mm, respectively. Information obtained pertaining to the technical and biological complications in the included studies was inadequate for statistical analysis. The frequent technical\/mechanical complications reported were abutment screw loosening, fracture of the overdenture prostheses, activation of retentive clips, ceramic chipping, and fractures. The common biological complication reported included peri-implant mucositis, mucosal enlargement, bone loss, pain, and implant loss.\nThis review provides robust evidence favoring dental implant therapy in elderly patients as a predictable long-term treatment option, in terms of implant survival, clinically acceptable PI-MBL changes, and minimal complications. Therefore, age alone should not be a limiting factor for dental implant therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256b","authors":["Srinivasan, Murali","Meyer, Simon","Mombelli, Andrea","M\u00fcller, Frauke"],"doi":"10.1111\/clr.12898","first_seen_on":"2016-06-20T06:17:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0501"],"journal":"Clinical Oral Implants Research","last_mentioned_on":1466398860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27273468"],"pmid":"27273468","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Dental implants in the elderly population: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-implants-elderly-population-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7921887,"mean":6.701594642987,"rank":1504257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6386498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7921887,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262461,"mean":11.538171683304,"rank":65037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":196921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262461,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":2.0019071856287,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":603,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.1526086956522,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Dental implant treatment in elderly patients","url":"http:\/\/www.nationalelfservice.net\/dentistry\/restorative-dentistry\/dental-implant-treatment-elderly-patients-predictable\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[8890997],"posted_on":"2016-06-20T05:01:00+00:00","summary":"6 studies were included in this review of dental implant treatment on patients aged 65 and over.
