The article presented the results of two studies. The first explored the test's dimensional structure in a sample of 202 patients in a range of several chronic illnesses. The second study examined the instrument's structure in a sample of 186 patients with specific chronic illness. The results replicated the original structure of the scale and proved to be valid for use with optimum reliability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Carmen Terol","Ana Lled\u00f3","Yolanda Quiles","Maite Mart\u00edn-Arag\u00f3n"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105313514284","endpage":"1482","first_seen_on":"2014-01-19T11:21:51+00:00","issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1390130501,"links":["http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/30\/1359105313514284.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/30\/1359105313514284.full.pdf","pmid":"24385631","pubdate":"2014-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1474","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Adaptation and validation of the Spanish version of the Social Comparison Scale in chronic illness patients","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptation-validation-spanish-version-social-comparison-scale-chronic-illness-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5482877,"mean":6.3671941900566,"rank":4561166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5482877,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144607,"mean":8.0608772665036,"rank":117870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1004,"mean":5.0892901296112,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1004,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":4.1283571428571,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
