Studies using this technique indicate that the ratio of glia to neurons in the human brain is approximately 1:1 rather than the 10:1 or 50:1 ratio previously assumed. Although some results obtained with the IF have been similar to those obtained by stereology, the IF has never been calibrated or validated. It is conceivable that only a fraction of glial cell nuclei are recovered intact or recognized after the homogenization step.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e7a","doi":"10.1016\/j.jneumeth.2013.11.002","first_seen_on":"2014-01-17T12:32:23+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["01650270"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Methods","last_mentioned_on":1389961905,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165027013003786?np=y"],"pmid":"24239779","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Validation of the isotropic fractionator: Comparison with unbiased stereology and DNA extraction for quantification of glial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/validation-isotropic-fractionator-comparison-unbiased-stereology-dna-extraction-quantification-glial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5489972,"mean":6.3741278702578,"rank":2918265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1866343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5489972,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143698,"mean":8.0827585266222,"rank":71560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":53518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143698,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":804,"mean":2.6678381070984,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":804,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.7805,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
