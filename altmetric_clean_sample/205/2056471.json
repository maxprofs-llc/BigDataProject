Little is known about how women who have experienced stillbirth (defined as fetal death at 20 or more weeks of gestation) feel about physical activity or use physical activity following this experience. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore women's beliefs about physical activity following a stillbirth.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d5","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2393-14-26","first_seen_on":"2014-01-20T13:20:21+00:00","issns":["1471-2393"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth","last_mentioned_on":1413307379,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/14\/26\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24433530","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/14\/26"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2393-14-26.pdf","pmid":"24433530","pubdate":"2014-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"A qualitative study exploring women\u2019s beliefs about physical activity after stillbirth","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/qualitative-study-exploring-womens-beliefs-about-physical-activity-after-stillbirth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":633056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3872458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121543,"mean":7.8335171051985,"rank":20434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":101026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121543,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1124,"mean":4.8500053428317,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1124,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":8.0602777777778,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
