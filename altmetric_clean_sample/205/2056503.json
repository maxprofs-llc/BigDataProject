The biological mechanisms linking stress to ill health are not fully understood, but significant evidence points to a central role of the stress axes; the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Together these two systems link the brain and the body and are crucial in maintaining homeostasis as well as improving an organism's survival chances in the face of environmental challenge. There is evidence of altered HPA axis function in people with a range of mental disorders, and this may in part explain the poor physical health of people with psychotic, mood and anxiety disorders. This paper systematically reviews HPA axis function in people with schizophrenia and relates this to the pattern of physical health seen in this disease. In summary, the evidence suggests people with schizophrenia can experience both hyper- and hypo-function of the HPA axis. It is likely that this contributes to the pattern of poor physical health and premature mortality suffered by people with schizophrenia, in particular the high rates of cardiovascular and metabolic disturbance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eeb","authors":["Bradley AJ","Dinan TG","Andrew J Bradley","Timothy G Dinan"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359786810385491","endpage":"118","first_seen_on":"2014-01-20T13:41:23+00:00","issns":["0269-8811","1461-7285"],"issue":"4 Suppl","journal":"Journal of Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1476159540,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20923924","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2951595\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2951595","pmid":"20923924","pubdate":"2010-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"91","subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"A systematic review of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in schizophrenia: implications for mortality.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-systematic-review-hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal-axis-function-schizophrenia-implications-morta-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.016,"score_history":{"1y":5.016,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.016},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":715577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6807752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184254,"mean":7.2719609775692,"rank":20432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":163814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184254,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1049,"mean":13.82018129771,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1049,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":10.146,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Meta-analysis finds that pituitary volume is not affected in people with first episode psychosis or schizophrenia","url":"http:\/\/www.thementalelf.net\/publication-types\/systematic-review\/meta-analysis-finds-that-pituitary-volume-is-not-affected-in-people-with-first-episode-psychosis-or-schizophrenia\/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=meta-analysis-finds-that-pituitary-volume-is-not-affected-in-people-with-first-episode-psychosis-or-schizophrenia","citation_ids":[1852018,2056503],"posted_on":"2014-01-20T07:30:00+00:00","summary":"* Declaration; I have published articles with two of the authors of this article, including on this topic, and know most of them professionally One influential model of the onset of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia is the stress-vulnerability mode","author":{"name":"The Mental Elf","url":"http:\/\/www.thementalelf.net","description":"Keeping you up to date with reliable mental health research, policy & guidance"}},{"title":"Somewhat Against Psychiatric Conditions As Domestication Failure","url":"http:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2016\/10\/11\/somewhat-against-psychiatric-conditions-as-domestication-failure\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[10395162,10957354,4579145,2587375,12556483,2208184,12556485,12556486,2056503],"posted_on":"2016-10-11T04:19:00+00:00","summary":"[Epistemic status: Not sure if I&rsquo;m arguing against a straw man here and my conclusion is what the researchers meant all along.]\nI.\nBenitez-Burraco and Lattanzi theorize that autism and schizophrenia are anomalies in the human self-domestication proce","author":{"name":"Slate Star Codex","url":"http:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/","description":"Peripherally associated with the Gwernosphere"}}]}}
