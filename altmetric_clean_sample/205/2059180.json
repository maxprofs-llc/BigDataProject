Studies investigating the impact of DUIC on traffic safety have shown evidence that, during the acute period of cannabis intoxication, cannabis diminishes driving faculties and is associated with an elevated risk of collision. However, DUIC drivers seem to exhibit a general reckless driving style that may contribute to an over-estimation of DUIC-related collisions among this group. In this study, we investigated DUIC drivers with respect to self-reported dangerous driving habits (e.g., risky driving, aggressive driving and negative emotional driving), behaviours observed in a driving simulator, psychological predictors and crash involvement. Results suggest that DUIC is associated with self-reported and observed risky driving and negative emotional driving. We also found that sensation seeking and impulsivity are independent psychological predictors of DUIC. Finally, a trend suggests that self-reported DUIC is associated with an increased risk of being involved in a car accident, after controlling for dangerous driving and demographic variables. Implications for interventions are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Richer I","Bergeron J","Isabelle Richer","Jacques Bergeron"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2008.12.004","first_seen_on":"2014-01-21T08:22:17+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["00014575"],"issue":"2","journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19245889","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001457508002376","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.aap.2008.12.004"],"pmid":"19245889","pubdate":"2009-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Driving under the influence of cannabis: Links with dangerous driving, psychological predictors, and accident involvement ","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/driving-under-influence-cannabis-links-dangerous-driving-psychological-predictors-accident-involveme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":415385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7546827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187424,"mean":7.3392526530898,"rank":11682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":175687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187424,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2488,"mean":5.5556847607559,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":2362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2488,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.0134615384615,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
