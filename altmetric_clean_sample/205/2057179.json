The Conference on Corporate Interference with Science and Health (the Conference) was held to examine this trend in three economically significant industries: fracking, food, and wireless. The Conference provided an overview of the structures of these three industries and the history of standard-setting therein, identified the sources of environmental exposures created by these industries, and surveyed the health consequences of these exposures and the policies that have resulted in them. It then examined corporate influence on the setting of these policies and the production of scientific studies and interpretation of their results. The Conference also analyzed the general influence of corporations on the political system and the relationship of this conflict of interest to the aforementioned topics. The concluding discussion focused on what solutions could be implemented to improve public health, including what institutional changes are necessary to promote public awareness and change policy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f610006729","authors":["Kopald DE"],"doi":"10.1515\/reveh-2013-0990","first_seen_on":"2014-01-20T20:09:00+00:00","issns":["0048-7554"],"issue":"4","journal":"Reviews on Environmental Health","last_mentioned_on":1393887803,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24413210"],"pmid":"24413210","pubdate":"2014-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Freund Publishing House Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"The Conference on Corporate Interference with Science and Health: Fracking, Food and Wireless: genesis, rationale, and results1).","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conference-corporate-interference-science-health-fracking-food-wireless-genesis-rationale-results"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6521706,"mean":6.0393421401286,"rank":768201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5751759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6521706,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156786,"mean":7.8225772746119,"rank":22665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":134054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156786,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":10.794916666667,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":10,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
