But the regulation mechanisms of progesterone-progesterone receptor (P4-PR) signaling during pregnancy remain largely unknown. In this study, we used medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate (MPA) which is a synthetic variant of progesterone and has 20-30 times the activity of progesterone to find that at the same physiological concentration as progesterone during early pregnancy MPA had no significant influence on ES cells self-renewal. But with the increasing of dosage, MPA can inhibit the self-renewal capacity of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and promote differentiation untimely. We further determined that MPA can influence the miR-200a\/zeb2 pathway by down regulating the level of miR-200a. miR-200a significantly higher expressed in ES cells to down-regulate the expression of zeb2 to inhibit the self-renewal and promote differentiation of ES cells. Then we found that the function of MPA can be rescued by over-expression of miR-200a or down-regulation of zeb2. Our findings revealed the progesterone signaling\/miR-200a\/zeb2 axis regulating the progesterone signaling to insure the balance of self-renewal and differentiation of ES cells. Our study also provided new insight into the dosage of progesterone and it's derivant in the hormone replacement therapy for pregnant woman.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ec","authors":["Yuyan Ai","Qidong Liu","Yanyi Li","Tao Duan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biopha.2013.12.006","first_seen_on":"2014-01-18T20:32:55+00:00","issns":["1950-6007"],"journal":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1416381754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24433831","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24433831?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24433831","pubdate":"2013-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["medicine","biology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Progesterone signaling\/miR-200a\/zeb2 axis regulates self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/progesterone-signalingmir200azeb2-axis-regulates-selfrenewal-mouse-embryonic-stem-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4527185,"mean":5.2867864119486,"rank":3096029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":857361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4527185,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121148,"mean":8.0148501077205,"rank":79646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":23879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121148,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":2.6811363636364,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
