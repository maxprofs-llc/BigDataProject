This study is an investigation of the effect of breast-feeding on current atopic dermatitis (AD) among Korean children. This cross-sectional study of children's histories of current AD and environmental factors was completed by the subjects' parents. The subjects included 10,383 children aged 0-13 years in Seoul, Korea, in 2008. The diagnostic criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood were applied in this study. Adjustments were performed for age, gender, maternal education, smoking in the household, relocation to a new house within 1 year of birth, and parental history of atopic disease. After adjustment for confounders, age and duration of maternal education were found to be inversely associated with the prevalence of AD. Among subjects aged \u22645 years, the prevalence of AD was positively associated with the duration of breast-feeding (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant association between AD and breast-feeding among children >5 years of age. Regardless of parental history of atopic diseases, breast-feeding >12 months was a significant risk factor for AD. The effect of breast-feeding differed by age group. Prolonged breast-feeding increased the risk of AD in children <5 years of age, regardless of parental history of atopic diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000694a","authors":["Soyoung Hong","Won-Jun Choi","Ho-Jang Kwon","Yoon Hee Cho","Hye Yung Yum","Dong Koog Son"],"doi":"10.2500\/aap.2014.35.3716","endpage":"70","first_seen_on":"2014-01-17T04:00:55+00:00","issns":["10885412","15396304"],"issue":"1","journal":"Allergy and Asthma Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1408390042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/ocean\/aap\/2014\/00000035\/00000001\/art00012","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24433599?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24433599\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24433599"],"pmid":"24433599","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"66","title":"Effect of prolonged breast-feeding on risk of atopic dermatitis in early childhood.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-prolonged-breastfeeding-risk-atopic-dermatitis-early-childhood"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":813997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3689703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120732,"mean":7.8571201928257,"rank":24824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":95741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120732,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":2.6834663573086,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":3.7472222222222,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
