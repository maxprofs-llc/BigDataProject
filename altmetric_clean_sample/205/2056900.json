When tracheobronchial tree is involved, respiratory obstructive symptoms can occur. A 35-year-old man, with a previous diagnosis of RP, was scheduled for rigid bronchoscopy to relieve dyspnea, caused by subglottic stenosis. After laser splitting of the subglottic web, the spontaneous respiration of the patient was insufficient, and hypercarbia developed progressively even with assisted ventilation. After 20 minutes of aggressive hyperventilation to reduce end-tidal CO2 level, sudden extreme tachycardia and hypotension developed. Ventilation rate was reduced and prolonged expiration time was allowed to alleviate a near-tampon status from dynamic hyperinflation. After the hemodynamic status was stabilized, the patient was transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation. He received ICU care for 30 days, and now, he was on supportive care on a ward, considering Y stent insertion to prevent luminal collapse from tracheobronchomalacia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc5b","authors":["Ahn HJ","Kim JA","Yang M","Lee EK"],"doi":"10.4097\/kjae.2013.65.6.569","first_seen_on":"2014-01-20T16:53:09+00:00","issns":["2005-6419"],"issue":"6","journal":"Korean Journal of Anesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1390237216,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24427466"],"pmcid":"PMC3888853","pmid":"24427466","pubdate":"2014-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Respiratory insufficiency and dynamic hyperinflation after rigid bronchoscopy in a patient with relapsing polychondritis -a case report-.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/respiratory-insufficiency-dynamic-hyperinflation-after-rigid-bronchoscopy-patient-relapsing-polychon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":4382539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147029,"mean":8.0133925918874,"rank":92584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":48715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147029,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":375,"mean":0.82111229946524,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":375,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.52058823529412,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
