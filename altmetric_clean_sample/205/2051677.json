Testing for each variant site individually is known to be underpowered, and therefore many methods have been proposed to test for the association of a group of variants with phenotypes, by pooling signals of the variants in a chromosomal region. However, this pooling strategy inevitably leads to the inclusion of a large proportion of neutral variants, which may compromise the power of association tests. To address this issue, we extend the [Formula: see text]-MidP method (Cheung et al., 2012, Genet Epidemiol 36: 675-685) and propose an approach (named 'adaptive combination of P-values for rare variant association testing', abbreviated as 'ADA') that adaptively combines per-site P-values with the weights based on MAFs. Before combining P-values, we first imposed a truncation threshold upon the per-site P-values, to guard against the noise caused by the inclusion of neutral variants. This ADA method is shown to outperform popular burden tests and non-burden tests under many scenarios. ADA is recommended for next-generation sequencing data analysis where many neutral variants may be included in a functional region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wan-Yu Lin","Xiang-Yang Lou","Guimin Gao","Nianjun Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0085728","first_seen_on":"2014-01-17T16:11:43+00:00","funders":["niams","nigms","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1390566002,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0085728","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24454922"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0085728.pdf","pmid":"24454922","pubdate":"2014-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e85728","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Rare Variant Association Testing by Adaptive Combination of P-values","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-variant-association-testing-adaptive-combination-pvalues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615617,"mean":6.1356453182895,"rank":2740330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3724708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615617,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155783,"mean":7.8722949249594,"rank":63659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":87194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155783,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100306,"mean":9.8739340012961,"rank":47462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":48764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100306,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7848,"mean":9.7496849751497,"rank":3240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7848,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
