Eighteen individuals with NIDDM consumed three test breakfasts calculated using the diabetic exchange meal-planning system. Foods were identical in each of the breakfasts except for foods in the fruit exchange. Carbohydrate-equivalent amounts of fresh orange slices, unsweetened orange juice, and regular, decaffeinated Coke were consumed in breakfasts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Serum glucose samples were drawn at fasting and 1, 2, and 3 hours postprandially. No difference was found in the postprandial serum glucose response when Coke versus orange juice was consumed in the breakfast. These findings question the appropriateness of using unsweetened fruit juices in routine meal planning for individuals with NIDDM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005885","authors":["M J Sullivan","R L Scott","Sullivan, M J","Scott, R L"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-18T21:22:49+00:00","issns":["0145-7217"],"issue":"4","journal":"Diabetes Educator","last_mentioned_on":1479760605,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2049981","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2049981"],"pmid":"2049981","pubdate":"2015-07-27T19:46:38+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["nursing","endocrinology"],"title":"Postprandial glycemic response to orange juice and nondiet cola: is there a difference?","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postprandial-glycemic-response-orange-juice-nondiet-cola-difference"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7722526,"mean":6.6240776217551,"rank":3028891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4637537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7722526,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184577,"mean":7.3186590889392,"rank":56346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":126730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184577,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":3.5474964028777,"rank":178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.690625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtom_butler\/status\/424653075593175040","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2053976],"posted_on":"2014-01-18T21:22:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Tom Butler","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pub\/thomas-butler\/66\/647\/629","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892721009052266499\/K30F-Syv_normal.jpg","description":"PhD.
