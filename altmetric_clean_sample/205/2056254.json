Especially, alterations in miRNA expression levels are frequently observed in human tumor cells and are associated with cancer pathogenesis. Earlier we established Fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant human colon cancer DLD-1 cells (DLD-1\/5FU) from parental 5-FU- sensitive DLD-1 cells. In the present study, we examined the expression of miRNA in each cell line and in its extracellular microvesicles (MVs) before and after treatment with 5-FU. The nascent RNAs of anti-oncogenic miR-34a and -145 labeled with EU in both cells were proved to be transferred into MVs in both cell lines. The levels of miR-34a and -145 in the cells and in their MVs were not largely different in the two cell lines, and a substantial amount of both miRNAs was secreted by both cell lines even in the steady-state condition. The exposure of both cell lines to 5-FU significantly increased the intracellular levels of miR-145 and miR-34a in the 5-FU-sensitive DLD-1 cells, whereas the level of neither miR was elevated in the DLD-1\/5FU cells. Interestingly, the amount of miR-145 detected in the small MVs shed into the medium of the parental cells was reduced after the treatment with 5-FU. On the other hand, the intracellular expression of miR-34a in the DLD-1\/5FU cells was down-regulated compared with that in the parental DLD-1 cells even in the steady-state condition. As to the miR-34a secreted into MVs, the increase in the level in DLD-1\/5FU cells was greater than that in the parental DLD-1 cells after the treatment with 5-FU. Thus, the intra- and extracellular miR-145 and -34a were closely associated with 5-FU resistance, and the resistance was in part due to the enhanced secretion of miR-145 and -34a via MVs, resulting in low intracellular levels of both miRNAs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Yukihiro Akao"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms15011392","first_seen_on":"2014-01-20T11:06:21+00:00","issns":["1422-0067",""],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1390215973,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/1\/1392"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/15\/1\/1392\/pdf","pmid":"24447928","pubdate":"2014-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Extracellular Disposal of Tumor-Suppressor miRs-145 and -34a via Microvesicles and 5-FU Resistance of Human Colon  Cancer Cells","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracellular-disposal-tumorsuppressor-mirs145-34a-via-microvesicles-5fu-resistance-human-colon-canc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282690,"mean":5.0215424405332,"rank":3398007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282690,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118550,"mean":7.6470108225292,"rank":92752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118550,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1836,"mean":1.5662822888283,"rank":1043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1836,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":1.0869458128079,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
