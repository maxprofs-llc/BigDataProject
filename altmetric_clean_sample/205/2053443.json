However, the etiology of cancer-related fatigue has not been determined. In previous studies, we have shown alterations in morning serum cortisol levels and diurnal cortisol rhythms in fatigued breast cancer survivors compared with nonfatigued control subjects. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate cortisol responses to an experimental psychologic stressor in fatigued and nonfatigued survivors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008675","authors":["Julienne E.
