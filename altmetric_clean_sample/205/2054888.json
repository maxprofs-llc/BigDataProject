We developed a Stroop Stepping Test (SST) that combines stepping and response inhibition using low-cost computer game technology to provide a functional measure that reflects real-life behaviour and determined whether this test discriminates between older fallers and non-fallers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a6","authors":["Stephen R.
