It is usually suspected when a patient presents with high serum or urine ketones and a high osmolar gap without acidosis. Acute renal failure due to isopropyl alcohol ingestion is rare. We describe a patient with isopropyl alcohol ingestion who presented with renal failure, but with a false elevation of serum creatinine secondary to interference by acetone with the colorimetric assay for creatinine. We highlight the use of blood gas analyzers, which use an enzymatic assay, thus avoiding acetone interference, as a quick method to correctly estimate the serum creatinine concentration and avoid labeling the patient as having acute renal failure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003597","authors":["Adla MR","Gonzalez-Paoli JA","Rifkin SI"],"doi":"10.1097\/smj.0b013e3181ac12f1","endpage":"869","first_seen_on":"2014-01-21T05:28:24+00:00","issns":["0038-4348"],"issue":"8","journal":"Southern Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1389968954,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19593296"],"pmid":"19593296","pubdate":"2009-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"867","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Isopropyl alcohol ingestion presenting as pseudorenal failure due to acetone interference.","type":"article","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isopropyl-alcohol-ingestion-presenting-pseudorenal-failure-due-acetone-interference"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":289294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3325459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108711,"mean":7.196190433263,"rank":11273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108711,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":616,"mean":2.8171089430894,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":616,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Why I Decided To Ditch Chemicals And Go Organic With My Hair Dye","url":"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/01\/17\/organic-hair-dye_n_4597190.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[1557259,2058822,1118355,2058823,2058824,2058825,920454,2058826,2058827],"posted_on":"2014-01-17T14:29:14+00:00","summary":"Trust me, when it comes to hair dye, I'm as picky as an amateur can be.
