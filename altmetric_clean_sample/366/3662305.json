Consequently, it is necessary to assess effectiveness of such protocols in representative species when new taxa become targets for induction. The threatened genus Mixophyes (family Myobatrachidae) has amongst the highest proportion of endangered species of all the Australian amphibians. This study developed and optimised the induction of oviposition in a non-threatened member of this taxon, the great barred frog (Mixophyes fasciolatus).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000890","authors":["John Clulow","Simon Clulow","Jitong Guo","Andrew J French","Michael J Mahony","Michael Archer","Clulow J","Clulow S","Guo J","French AJ","Mahony MJ","Archer M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1477-7827-10-60","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T11:31:30+00:00","handle":"11343\/32849","handles":["11343\/32849"],"issns":["1477-7827",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1401564957,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1477-7827-10-60","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1477-7827-10-60"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.rbej.com\/content\/pdf\/1477-7827-10-60.pdf","pmid":"22909256","pubdate":"2012-08-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"60","subjects":["endocrinology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Optimisation of an oviposition protocol employing human chorionic and pregnant mare serum gonadotropins in the Barred Frog Mixophyes fasciolatus (Myobatrachidae)","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/rbej.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1477-7827-10-60","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimisation-oviposition-protocol-employing-human-chorionic-pregnant-mare-serum-gonadotropins-barred"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3821406,"mean":5.0294378797571,"rank":876545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2414872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3821406,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124095,"mean":9.0804860025466,"rank":37083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":85614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124095,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248,"mean":3.7383076923077,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.6875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
