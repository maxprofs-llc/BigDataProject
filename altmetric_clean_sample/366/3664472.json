Unrecognized, these can result in delayed wound healing and osteomyelitis, necessitating distal amputations. To elucidate the genetic basis of an HSN I subtype in a family in which mutations in the few known HSN I genes had been excluded, we employed massive parallel exon sequencing of the 14.3 Mb disease interval on chromosome 14q. We detected a missense mutation (c.1065C>A, p.Asn355Lys) in atlastin-1 (ATL1), a gene that is known to be mutated in early-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia SPG3A and that encodes the large dynamin-related GTPase atlastin-1. The mutant protein exhibited reduced GTPase activity and prominently disrupted ER network morphology when expressed in COS7 cells, strongly supporting pathogenicity. An expanded screen in 115 additional HSN I patients identified two further dominant ATL1 mutations (c.196G>C [p.Glu66Gln] and c.976 delG [p.Val326TrpfsX8]). This study highlights an unexpected major role for atlastin-1 in the function of sensory neurons and identifies HSN I and SPG3A as allelic disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Guelly C","Zhu PP","Leonardis L","Papi\u0107 L","Zidar J","Schabh\u00fcttl M","Strohmaier H","Weis J","Strom TM","Baets J","Willems J","De Jonghe P","Reilly MM","Fr\u00f6hlich E","Hatz M","Trajanoski S","Pieber TR","Janecke AR","Blackstone C","Auer-Grumbach M","Christian Guelly","Peng-Peng Zhu","Lea Leonardis","Lea Papi\u0107","Janez Zidar","Maria Schabh\u00fcttl","Heimo Strohmaier","Joachim Weis","Tim M.
