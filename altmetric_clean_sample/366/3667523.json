The affinity towards Kv1 channels is very weak (Kd approximately 79 micro m for Kv1.1 channels), or moderate (Kd approximately 500 nm for Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels). In an effort to generate a more potent K+ channel blocker, we recombinantly produced a mutant PBTx3 by the introduction of an aromatic amino acid, fenylalanine in close proximity of the crucial lysine 26 residue, to create a functional diad similar to subfamily three alpha-K+ toxins. The mutant was tested for his ability to block Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes: a hundred-fold higher affinity towards Kv1.1 channels and a fivefold increase in affinity towards Kv1.3 channels was observed, when compared to the wild-type toxin. The effect on Kv1.2 channels was similar to the wild-type toxin, indicating a specific interaction site for the mutated residue onto the different Kv-type channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002841","authors":["Isabelle Huys","Jan Tytgat"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T14:16:43+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0953-816X"],"issue":"9","journal":"European Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1381758198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12752777"],"pmid":"12752777","pubdate":"2003-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Evidence for a function-specific mutation in the neurotoxin, parabutoxin 3.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-functionspecific-mutation-neurotoxin-parabutoxin-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636263,"mean":4.9213309833055,"rank":816993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636263,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98963,"mean":8.241191386593,"rank":25935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98963,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1989,"mean":3.214907444668,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1989,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.2970588235294,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
