However, the common co-occurrence of distyly and monomorphy in closely related groups within the family has made the interpretation of its evolution difficult.Here, we infer a chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) phylogeny for 207 accessions, including 51% of the species and 95% of the sections of Primula with monomorphic populations, using Bayesian methods. With this tree, we infer the distribution of ancestral states on critical nodes using parsimony and likelihood methods. The inferred cpDNA phylogeny is consistent with prior estimates. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Primula is resolved as distylous using both methods of inference. However, whether the distyly in Primula, Hottonia, and Vitaliana arose once or three independent times is not clear. We conclude that monomorphism in descendants of the MRCA of Primula is derived from distyly in all cases. Thus, scenarios for the evolution of distyly that rely on the persistence of primitive monomorphy (such as in Primula section Sphondylia) require re-evaluation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50e3cf058f6100031cc","authors":["Mast, Austin R.","Kelso, Sylvia","Conti, Elena"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2006.01700.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T14:56:18+00:00","issns":["1469-8137"],"journal":"New Phytologist","last_mentioned_on":1384364380,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2006.01700.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16866962"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1469-8137.2006.01700.x\/pdf","pmid":"16866962","pubdate":"2006-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Are any primroses (Primula) primitively monomorphic?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primroses-primula-primitively-monomorphic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":816742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98809,"mean":8.2357408711846,"rank":25888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98809,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2020,"mean":5.2297870232788,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2020,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":5.4234838709677,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
