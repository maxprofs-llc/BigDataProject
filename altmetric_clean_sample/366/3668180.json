It is often preferable to fusion when both wrists are arthritic. Newer prosthetic designs provide a functional range of motion, better wrist balance,reduced risk of loosening, and better implant stability than older designs. The success of total wrist arthroplasty depends on appropriate patient selection, careful preoperative planning, and sound surgical technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005908","doi":"10.1016\/j.hcl.2005.08.014","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T14:37:10+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Hand clinics","last_mentioned_on":1382984354,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.hcl.2005.08.014","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16274871"],"pmid":"16274871","pubdate":"2005-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Total wrist arthroplasty.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/total-wrist-arthroplasty-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":816196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98057,"mean":8.1805867667458,"rank":25547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98057,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.9583333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":3,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Wrist osteoarthritis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=579141929#altmetric_citation_16","license":"public","citation_ids":[3668180],"posted_on":"2013-10-28T18:19:14+00:00","summary":"Osteoarthritis is a group of mechanical abnormalities resulting in joint destruction, which can occur in the wrist.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=40914531","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Cvpoucke","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Cvpoucke"}}]}}
