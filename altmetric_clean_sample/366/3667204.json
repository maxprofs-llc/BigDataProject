T. muriaticus formed histamine in low acidity (pH 5.8), O2 limiting conditions with optimal NaCl and glucose concentrations of 5-7% (w\/v) and above 1%, respectively. Histamine formation could not be prevented even at 20% (w\/v) NaCl, indicating that NaCl could not prevent histamine formation by this bacterium. A conspicuous amount of histamine accumulated only during the late stationary phase regardless of the growth conditions. Studies of cell suspension experiments confirmed the results obtained from cultured cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["B Kimura","Y Konagaya","T Fujii"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T14:08:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-1605"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1381232965,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11759764"],"pmid":"11759764","pubdate":"2001-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Histamine formation by Tetragenococcus muriaticus, a halophilic lactic acid bacterium isolated from fish sauce.","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histamine-formation-tetragenococcus-muriaticus-halophilic-lactic-acid-bacterium-isolated-fish-sauce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":817853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96952,"mean":8.0693709193305,"rank":25041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96952,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":755,"mean":2.1469734748011,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":755,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.70666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":8,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Tetragenococcus muriaticus","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=576276342#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3667204],"posted_on":"2013-10-08T11:49:25+00:00","summary":"Tetragenococcus muriaticus is a species of moderately halophilic lactic acid, histamine-producing bacteria.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=40739291","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"FoCuSandLeArN","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:FoCuSandLeArN"}}]}}
