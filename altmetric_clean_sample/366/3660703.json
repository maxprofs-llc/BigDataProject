Morphological, cultural and biochemical studies indicated that the organisms were related to the family Cardiobacteriaceae in the gamma-subclass of the Proteobacteria. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies confirmed these findings and demonstrated that the bacterium represents a hitherto unknown subline within this family. The closest phylogenetic relative of the strains isolated from the birds was found to be Suttonella indologenes, although a sequence divergence of approximately 5 % demonstrated that the unknown bacterium represented a novel species. On the basis of the results of the phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic criteria, it is proposed that the bacteria recovered from the diseased birds represent a novel species, Suttonella ornithocola sp. nov., with strain B6\/99\/2T (=CCUG 49457T=NCTC 13337T) as the type strain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Geoffrey Foster","Henry Malnick","Paul A.
