Cells were Gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating, straight to curved rods with one polar flagellum and had a strictly respiratory metabolism with O(2) as the preferential terminal electron acceptor. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that all strains clustered within the Xanthomonadaceae branch of the Proteobacteria. Isolates AMX 26B(T) and UR374_02 exhibited 100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and both were related to strain 12-3(T) (99.6 % similarity). The closest relative of all the isolates was Pseudoxanthomonas broegbernensis DSM 12573(T) (similarity 97.1-97.5 %), and they were equidistantly related to Xanthomonas species (95.4-96.6 %), Stenotrophomonas species (95.3-96.1 %) and Pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis ATCC BAA-4040(T) (95.3-95.4 %). Chemotaxonomic and biochemical data (branched-chain cellular fatty acid pattern without C(13 : 0) iso 3-OH, ubiquinone with eight isoprenoid units, limited range of substrates used, ability to reduce nitrite but not nitrate with the production of N(2)O) supported their affiliation to the genus Pseudoxanthomonas. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and\/or phenotypic analysis allowed them to be differentiated from the two Pseudoxanthomonas species with validly published names and showed that strain 12-3(T) was genomically and phenotypically distinct from the other two isolates. On the basis of these results, two novel species of the genus Pseudoxanthomonas are proposed: Pseudoxanthomonas mexicana sp. nov., consisting of strains AMX 26B(T) (=ATCC 700993(T)=CIP 106674(T)=JCM 11524(T)) (type strain) and UR374_02 (=DSM 15133), and Pseudoxanthomonas japonensis sp. nov., consisting of strain 12-3(T) (=CCUG 48231(T)=CIP 107388(T)=JCM 11525(T)). The report of these two novel species leads to the emendation of the description of the genus Pseudoxanthomonas and the re-evaluation of the phenotype of P. broegbernensis DSM 12573(T) necessitates the emendation of its description.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["S\u00e9bastien Thierry","Herv\u00e9 Macarie","Takashi Iizuka","Walter Gei\u00dfd\u00f6rfer","Essokazi A.
