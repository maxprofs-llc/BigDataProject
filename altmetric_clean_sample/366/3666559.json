Neurocognitive sequelae of clinically apparent cerebrovascular accidents in children with SCD are characterized by pervasive impairments, including decrements in general intellectual functioning, language and verbal abilities, visual-motor and visual-spatial processing, memory, academic achievement, and processing of subtle prosodic information. In contrast, subtle neurocognitive deficits in the areas of attention and concentration, executive function, and visual-motor speed and coordination appear to be associated with silent infarcts that are not necessarily detected on physical examination. Investigation of the disease course and associated neurocognitive sequelae suggest a disease-specific model of neuropsychological impairment. Recommendations are made for clinical and research efforts in the field of pediatric neuropsychology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a6","authors":["M C Kral","R T Brown","G W Hynd"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T13:45:42+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1040-7308"],"issue":"4","journal":"Neuropsychology Review","last_mentioned_on":1333693609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11883668"],"pmid":"11883668","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Neuropsychological aspects of pediatric sickle cell disease.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuropsychological-aspects-pediatric-sickle-cell-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":816179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98009,"mean":8.1783455228147,"rank":25524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98009,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":4.7253684210526,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":5.83,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
