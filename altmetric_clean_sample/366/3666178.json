These elements underpin transduction of hypercapnia, hypoxia and acid sensing at central and peripheral chemoreceptors. The processes involve propagation of an extracellular ATP signal and associated P2 receptor activation, where ATP acts on both the glial cells and the associated output cells in the sensor complex - the respiratory rhythm generator neurons and the ventral inspiratory pre-motor neurons. At the peripheral carotid chemoreceptor, the hypoxia sensor likely involves the gasotransmitter H(2)S, complemented by purinergic neurotransmission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002383","authors":["Housley GD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.autneu.2011.08.002","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T13:33:41+00:00","issns":["1566-0702","15660702"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Autonomic Neuroscience: Basic & Clinical","last_mentioned_on":1398210092,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21852203","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.autneu.2011.08.002"],"pmid":"21852203","pubdate":"2011-08-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Recent insights into the regulation of breathing","type":"article","volume":"164","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-insights-regulation-breathing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3683995,"mean":4.8997159343948,"rank":833487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2326596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3683995,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106044,"mean":8.5344415001462,"rank":29723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":75145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106044,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.5095346534653,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
