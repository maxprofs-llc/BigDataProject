(1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 183, 471-477]. A study of the specificity of S. griseus aminopeptidase using amino acid 4-nitroanilide substrates shows that the leucine derivative is the best substrate. Derivatives of other hydrophobic amino acids, methionine and phenylalanine, are also excellent substrates for the enzyme. The 4-nitroanilides of alanine, valine, proline and lysine are good substrates whereas those of the small size glycine and the acidic amino acids are very poor. No hydrolysis of a terminal Xaa residue can be detected with Xaa-proline N-terminal sequences. Calcium ions bind to the enzyme and modulate its activity in a substrate-dependent manner. The catalytically essential zinc of S. griseus aminopeptidase is removed by dialysis against 1,10-phenanthroline and replaced by manganese or cobalt ions, resulting in enzyme derivatives of altered specificities. Thus, whereas the zinc enzyme hydrolyzes leucine 4-nitroanilide at a 10-fold faster rate than the manganese or cobalt enzymes, the cobalt enzyme hydrolyzes alanine 4-nitroanilide at a more than 20-fold faster rate than the zinc or manganese enzymes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002820","authors":["D Ben-Meir","A Spungin","R Ashkenazi","S Blumberg"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T10:45:25+00:00","issns":["0014-2956"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1366097232,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8444149"],"pmid":"8444149","pubdate":"1993-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Specificity of Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase and modulation of activity by divalent metal ion binding and substitution.","type":"article","volume":"212","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specificity-streptomyces-griseus-aminopeptidase-modulation-activity-divalent-metal-ion-binding-subst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":815892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98691,"mean":8.2216722261629,"rank":25814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98691,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2662,"mean":2.8304772641864,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2662,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Aminopeptidase S","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=550606052#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3660725,3660728],"posted_on":"2013-04-16T07:27:12+00:00","summary":"This enzyme contains two zinc molecules in its active site and is activated by Ca2+.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=39126336","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Dcirovic","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Dcirovic"}}]}}
