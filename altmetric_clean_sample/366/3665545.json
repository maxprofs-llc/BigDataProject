MT81, acetylated MT81 and acetic acid MT81 exhibited sensitivity (31.25, 62.50, 62.50 micrograms\/ml respectively) to all the test bacteria. Benzoylated-MT81 did not exhibit any activity even up to 1000 mcg\/ml. MT81, its acetylated and acetic acid derivatives exhibited antifungal activity up to 62.5 micrograms\/ml and 125.0 micrograms\/ml respectively against test yeasts and other fungi. Benzoylated MT81 also exhibited antifungal activity but the degree was comparatively less.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf5","authors":["S Choudhury","M P Rana","T K Chatterjee","U K Mazumder","M Gupta"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T13:13:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0019-5189"],"issue":"2","journal":"Indian journal of experimental biology","last_mentioned_on":1380737967,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1521863"],"pmid":"1521863","pubdate":"1992-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Antimicrobial activities of mycotoxin MT81 and its structural derivatives.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-activities-mycotoxin-mt81-structural-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9307173704291,"rank":816007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96214,"mean":7.3655386294423,"rank":24383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96214,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.6128901098901,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"MT81","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=575471666#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3665545],"posted_on":"2013-10-02T18:19:27+00:00","summary":"MT81 is a mycotoxin with antibiotic activity.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=40254551","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Edgar181","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Edgar181"}}]}}
