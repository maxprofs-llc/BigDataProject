This study aims to extend the basis for analyses by making available the worldwide data with help of an international registry. One hundred and seventy six patients were analysed, main indications are acute-on-chronic liver failure (56%), acute liver failure (22%), primary graft dysfunction (15%), liver failure post liver surgery (4%) and miscellaneous (3%). The predicted survival within the first group based on a mean MELD score of 30.4 pts. and a mean Child score of 12.6 pts. was quite limited. The data suggest an improved survival accompanied by significant improvements of hepatic encephalopathy, mean arterial pressure, serum bilirubin level, creatinine, urea, albumin, INR, ammonia and MELD score. The results are confirming observations of other trials before which have shown MARS therapy to be an effective and safe extracorporeal liver support in liver failure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fe3cf058f61000302e","authors":["Christian Steiner","Steffen Mitzner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T11:01:49+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0106-9543"],"journal":"Liver","last_mentioned_on":1373296638,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12220298"],"pmid":"12220298","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Experiences with MARS liver support therapy in liver failure: analysis of 176 patients of the International MARS Registry.","type":"article","volume":"22 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experiences-mars-liver-support-therapy-liver-failure-analysis-176-patients-international-mars-regist"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":816947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97510,"mean":8.1408232881069,"rank":25297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97510,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.46,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
