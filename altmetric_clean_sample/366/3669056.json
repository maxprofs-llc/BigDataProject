Because synaptic properties vary from one type of synapse to another, synapse-glia interactions should differ accordingly. The goal of this work was to examine how glial cell activation is dependent upon the properties of their respective synapses as well as the level of synaptic activity. We contrasted Ca(2+) responses of perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs) at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) with different synaptic properties; the slow-twitch soleus (SOL) and the fast-twitch levator auris longus (LAL) muscles. Amplitude of PSC Ca(2+) responses elicited by repeated motor nerve stimulation at 40, 50 and 100 Hz were larger and their kinetics faster at LAL NMJs and this, at all frequencies examined. In addition, a greater number of PSCs per NMJ was activated by sustained synaptic transmission at NMJs of LAL in comparison to SOL. Differences in PSC activation could not be explained solely by differences in levels of transmitter release but also by intrinsic PSC properties since increasing transmitter release with tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) did not increase their responsiveness. As a whole, these results indicate that PSC responsiveness at NMJs of slow- and fast-twitch muscles differ not only according to the level of activity of their synaptic partner but also in accordance with inherent glial properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2010.02.036","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T15:03:10+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1399537124,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2010.02.036"],"pmid":"20188148","pubdate":"2010-03-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Synapse-glia interactions are governed by synaptic and intrinsic glial properties.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synapseglia-interactions-governed-synaptic-intrinsic-glial-properties"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3729262,"mean":4.9816633993518,"rank":847718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2357409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3729262,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115478,"mean":8.8610725945428,"rank":33670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115478,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1880,"mean":2.6976466205428,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1880,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":2.0030989010989,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
