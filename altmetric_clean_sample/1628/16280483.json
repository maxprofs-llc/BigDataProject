Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) described in cancer and inflammatory processes may be involved in sepsis-induced immune suppression but their clinical impact remains poorly defined.\nTo clarify phenotype, suppressive activity, origin, and clinical impact of MDSCs in septic patients.\nPeripheral blood transcriptomic analysis was performed on 29 septic patients and 15 healthy donors. A second cohort of 94 consecutive septic patients, 11 severity-matched intensive care patients and 67 healthy donors was prospectively enrolled for flow cytometry and functional experiments.\nGenes involved in MDSC suppressive functions, including S100A12, S100A9, MMP8 and ARG1, were upregulated in the peripheral blood of septic patients. CD14(pos)HLA-DR(low\/neg) monocytic (M)-MDSCs were expanded in intensive care septic and non-septic patients and CD14(neg)CD15(pos) low-density granulocytes\/ granulocytic (G)-MDSCs were more specifically expanded in septic patients (p<.001). Plasma levels of MDSC mediators S100A8\/A9, S100A12, and Arginase 1 were significantly increased. In vitro, CD14(pos)- and CD15(pos)-cell depletion increased T-cell proliferation in septic patients. G-MDSCs, made of immature and mature granulocytes expressing high levels of degranulation markers, were specifically responsible for arginase 1 activity. High initial levels of G-MDSCs, arginase 1, and S100A12 but not M-MDSCs were associated with subsequent occurrence of nosocomial infections.\nM-MDSCs and G-MDSCs strongly contribute to T-cell dysfunction in septic patients. More specifically, G-MDSCs producing arginase 1 are associated with a higher incidence of nosocomial infections and appear to be major actors of sepsis-induced immune suppression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005716","authors":["Uhel, Fabrice","Azzaoui, Imane","Gr\u00e9goire, Murielle","Pangault, C\u00e9line","Dulong, Joelle","Tadi\u00e9, Jean-Marc","Gacouin, Arnaud","Camus, Christophe","Cynober, Luc","Fest, Thierry","Le Tulzo, Yves","Roussel, Mikael","Tarte, Karin","Fabrice Uhel","Imane Azzaoui","Murielle Gr\u00e9goire","C\u00e9line Pangault","Joelle Dulong","Jean-Marc Tadi\u00e9","Arnaud Gacouin","Christophe Camus","Luc Cynober","Thierry Fest","Yves Le Tulzo","Mikael Roussel","Karin Tarte"],"doi":"10.1164\/rccm.201606-1143oc","first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T00:52:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-4970","1073-449X"],"journal":"American Journal of Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1502198765,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1164\/rccm.201606-1143OC","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/full\/10.1164\/rccm.201606-1143OC"],"pmid":"28146645","publisher":"American Thoracic Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Early Expansion of Circulating Granulocytic Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells Predicts Development of Nosocomial Infections in Septic Patients.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-expansion-circulating-granulocytic-myeloidderived-suppressor-cells-predicts-development-nosoco"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.1,"6m":2.85,"3m":2.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":2112320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6210419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277616,"mean":12.69592339751,"rank":95007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":181430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277616,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4593,"mean":8.2224738675958,"rank":1925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4593,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":20.400827586207,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
