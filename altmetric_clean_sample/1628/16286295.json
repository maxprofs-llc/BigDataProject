Collagen production by fibroblasts is known to play a vital role in wound healing and device fibrous encapsulation. However, the influence of surface nanotopography on collagen deposition by these cells has not been reported so far. To address this gap, we have developed model substrata having surface nanotopography of controlled height of 16, 38 and 68 nm and tailored outermost surface chemistry of amines, carboxyl acid and pure hydrocarbon. Fibroblast adhesion was reduced on nanotopographically modified surfaces compared to the smooth control. Furthermore, amine and acid functionalized surfaces showed increased cell proliferation over hydrophobic hydrocarbon surfaces. Collagen III production increased from day 3 to day 8 and then decreased from day 8 to day 16 on all surfaces, whilst collagen I deposition increased throughout the duration of 16 days. Our data shows that the initial collagen I and III deposition can be modulated by selecting desired combinations of surface nanotopography and chemistry. This study provides useful knowledge that could help in tuning fibrous capsule formation and in turn govern the fate of implantable biomaterial devices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Akash Bachhuka","John Dominic Hayball","Louise E.
