Several studies report improvement of subjective health after removal of amalgam restorations, but the mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this paper is to present data on long term changes in intensity of health complaints after amalgam removal in a group of patients with health complaints self-attributed to dental amalgam. Data from the five years follow-up in a clinical trial are presented and related to potential determinants of change.\nPatients previously referred to a specialty unit for health complaints attributed to amalgam restorations were included in the study. The 20 participants who were allocated to the treatment group had all amalgam restorations removed and replaced with other dental restorative materials. Intensity of health complaints was calculated from questionnaire data and personality variables were measured by MMPI-2.\nAt the follow-up five years after the amalgam removal was completed, intensity of general health complaints was significantly reduced (p=.001), but the symptom load was still high. The reduction was significantly correlated with concentration of mercury in urine at pre-treatment. There were no significant correlations with personality variables.\nRemoval of amalgam restorations was followed by a long term reduction of general health complaints, which was associated with mercury concentration in urine before amalgam removal. Additional studies are needed to confirm the potential mechanisms for the observed reduction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000215b","authors":["Lars Bj\u00f6rkman","Therese T.
