The development of minimally toxic and highly efficient non-viral gene delivery vectors is the most challenging undertaking in the field of gene therapy. Here, we developed dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DODAB)-nanoceria (CeO2) hybrids as a new class of non-viral gene delivery vectors. These DODAB-modified CeO2 nanoparticles (CeO2\/DODAB) could effectively compact the pDNA, allowing for highly efficient gene transfection into the selected cell lines. The CeO2\/DODAB nanovectors were also found to be non-toxic and did not induce ROS formation as well as any stress responsive and pro-survival signaling pathways. The overall vector performance of CeO2\/DODAB nanohybrids was comparable with lipofectamine and DOTAP, and higher than calcium phosphate and DEAE-dextran for transfecting small plasmids. The increased cellular uptake of the nanovector\/DNA complexes through clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis and subsequent release from the endosomes further support the increased gene transfection efficiency of the CeO2\/DODAB vectors. Besides, CeO2\/DODAB nanovectors could transfect genes in vivo without any sign of toxicity. Taken together, this new nano-vector has the potential to be used for gene delivery in biomedical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Joydeep Das","Jae Woong Han","Yun-Jung Choi","Hyuk Song","Ssang-Goo Cho","Chankyu Park","Han Geuk Seo","Jin-Hoi Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep29197","first_seen_on":"2016-07-18T21:10:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1468876215,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep29197?WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20160712&spMailingID=51811201&spUserID=MTk2NTE4MDY4NjA2S0&spJobID=961604821&spReportId=OTYxNjA0ODIxS0&utm_content=buffer04735&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmcid":"PMC4933920","pmid":"27380727","pubdate":"2016-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Chemical biology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"29197","subjects":["science"],"title":"Cationic lipid-nanoceria hybrids, a novel nonviral vector-mediated gene delivery into mammalian cells: investigation of the cellular uptake mechanism","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cationic-lipidnanoceria-hybrids-novel-nonviral-vectormediated-gene-delivery-mammalian-cells-investig"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083793,"mean":6.8666882938024,"rank":6997518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083793,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257934,"mean":11.959673930826,"rank":218110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33096,"mean":14.930487143073,"rank":28018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33096,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3271,"mean":16.610552293578,"rank":2746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3271,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
