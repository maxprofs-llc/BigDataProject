Twenty-five subjects with uncomplicated cataract who were scheduled for cataract surgery were enrolled. If surgery was uneventful, subjects received either an injection in that eye or followed a minimum drop postoperative pharmaceutical regimen. The second eye surgery was performed with the opposite treatment. Subjects were followed for 1 month. Measures of interest were the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline and the changes in corneal and macular thickness. Subjects were also asked to evaluate pain perception, visual quality, and overall satisfaction with surgery. They were also asked which regimen they preferred.\nIOP was not statistically significantly different between the groups (P=0.81); there was also no statistically significant difference in IOP over time (P=0.74). There was no statistically significant difference in central macular thickness at 1 week and 1 month between the groups (P=0.18). The central corneal thickness was significantly greater 1 day postoperatively relative to baseline, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups at any time point (P=0.92). The difference in reported pain was also not statistically significantly different between the groups (P=0.67). Satisfaction with surgery was similar for both groups, but significantly more subjects preferred the injection for overall experience (P<0.01).\nCataract surgery completed with the two pharmaceutical regimens was similar in outcome. Significantly more subjects preferred the injection, presumably as a function of the greater convenience with no apparent difference in the therapeutic effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Rick Potvin","Bret Fisher"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s112080","endpage":"1303","first_seen_on":"2016-07-19T02:00:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5483","1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1472220058,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/transzonular-vitreous-injection-vs-a-single-drop-compounded-topical-ph-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2147\/OPTH.S112080"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=31425","pmcid":"PMC4957678","pmid":"27486301","pubdate":"2016-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1297","title":"Transzonular vitreous injection vs a single drop compounded topical pharmaceutical regimen after cataract surgery","type":"article","volume":"Volume 10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transzonular-vitreous-injection-vs-single-drop-compounded-topical-pharmaceutical-regimen-after-catar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":95.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":95.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":88759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8194116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259924,"mean":12.016099783397,"rank":6332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":253590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259924,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1288,"mean":2.6696876456876,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":1284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1288,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":6.8216216216216,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Peer-Reviewed Study of Dropless Cataract Surgery Shows 'Measurable Benefits' Compared to Drops","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27354194127&p=1pl&v=1&x=DaVjbHRrVBxFEhNJtynxrA","license":"public","citation_ids":[9836509,9836509],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T13:00:00+00:00","summary":"Journal of Clinical Ophthalmology reports 'strong patient preference' for Imprimis Pharmaceuticals' Dropless Therapy\u00ae formulation SAN DIEGO, July 22, 2016 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","author":{"name":"PR Newswire","url":"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/545\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-01-06_at_16.29.18.png?1452097789"}},{"title":"Peer-Reviewed Study of Dropless Cataract Surgery Shows 'Measurable Benefits' Compared to Drops","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27354124631&p=1pl&v=1&x=R1v_W-0oCyq2FzwGZAuE_w","license":"public","citation_ids":[9836509,9836509],"posted_on":"2016-07-22T13:00:00+00:00","summary":"\/PRNewswire\/ -- Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
