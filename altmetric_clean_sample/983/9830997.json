Cases of inflammatory response were separated into culture-positive endophthalmitis, noninfectious vitritis (not treated with intravitreal antibiotics), and indeterminate. Noninfectious cases were analyzed for rate, presentation, and clinical course.\nA total of 66,356 bevacizumab, 26,161 ranibizumab, and 8071 aflibercept injections were screened. The rates of noninfectious vitritis were 0.10% (67 cases) for bevacizumab, 0.02% (6 cases) for ranibizumab, and 0.16% (13 cases) for aflibercept. The differences were statistically significant based on Chi-square analysis (P < 0.001). Mean differences in visual decline were not significant by Kruskal-Wallis analysis (P = 0.12), but the percentage of patients with any visual decline did vary by medication according to Fisher exact test (P < 0.05). The percentage of patients with complaints of pain, blurred vision, and subjective floaters was not significantly different by medication based on Fisher exact testing (P = 0.2, P = 0.18, P = 0.16, respectively). Bevacizumab and aflibercept cases tended to present in separate chronological clusters.\nThe results suggest a difference in rates of noninfectious vitritis for antivascular endothelial growth factor medications. Many cases tended to cluster instead of occurring at a consistent rate each year.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008765","authors":["Williams, Patrick D.","Chong, Deborah","Fuller, Timothy","Callanan, David","Patrick D.
