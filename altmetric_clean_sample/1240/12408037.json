The absolute configurations of four terpenes were determined based on their optical rotary powers. Incubation experiments with (13)C-labelled isotopomers of FPP in buffers containing water or deuterium oxide allowed for detailed insights into the cyclisation mechanisms of the bacterial terpene cyclases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007df","authors":["Patrick Rabe"],"doi":"10.3762\/bjoc.12.173","endpage":"1850","first_seen_on":"2016-10-03T19:55:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1860-5397"],"journal":"Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1475524517,"links":["http:\/\/www.beilstein-journals.org\/bjoc\/single\/articleFullText.htm?publicId=1860-5397-12-173"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.beilstein-journals.org\/bjoc\/content\/pdf\/1860-5397-12-173.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5082573","pmid":"27829890","pubdate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Beilstein-Institut","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1839","title":"Mechanistic investigations on six bacterial terpene cyclases","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanistic-investigations-six-bacterial-terpene-cyclases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7474500,"mean":6.4836868429538,"rank":3104575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4261757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7474500,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239893,"mean":12.525123330498,"rank":98566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":137144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239893,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.471652892562,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3818181818182,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
