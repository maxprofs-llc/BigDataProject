This analysis evaluated safety data from 14 trials (4 phase 2 and 10 phase 3, 8 to 104\u00a0weeks; n\u00a0= 5,234), in 2 pools according to control (placebo\/ezetimibe). Overall, 3,340 patients received alirocumab (4,029 patient-years' exposure), 1,276 received placebo, and 618 received ezetimibe. Incidence of deaths, serious TEAEs, discontinuations because of TEAEs, and overall TEAEs were similar between alirocumab and control groups. Alirocumab was associated with a higher incidence of local injection site reactions (7.4% vs 5.3% with placebo; 3.1% vs 2.3% with ezetimibe), pruritus (1.3% vs 0.4% placebo; 0.9% vs 0.5% ezetimibe), and upper respiratory tract infection signs and symptoms (2.1% vs 1.1% placebo; 1.3% vs 0.8% ezetimibe). Incidence of musculoskeletal, neurologic, neurocognitive, ophthalmologic, hepatic events, and TEAEs related to diabetes\/diabetes complications was similar between alirocumab and control groups. In a prespecified analysis of phase 3 studies, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) occurred in 1.8% alirocumab versus 2.6% placebo patients (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.11) and 2.8% alirocumab versus 1.5% ezetimibe patients (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 3.02). In conclusion, pooled safety data from 14 trials demonstrate that alirocumab is generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Peter H.
