The present investigation was designed to determine the feasibility and reliability of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) administration by comparing video teleconference (VTC) with face-to-face (FF) test conditions. Eighteen adult subjects over age 55 with and without cognitive impairment were administered Forms A and B of the RBANS in VTC and FF settings in counterbalanced fashion. Similar RBANS scores were obtained in both test conditions, with generally high correlations between administration methods. Results support the feasibility and reliability of remote administration of the RBANS via VTC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002300","authors":["Galusha-Glasscock, Jeanine M","Horton, Daniel K","Weiner, Myron F","Cullum, C Munro"],"doi":"10.1093\/arclin\/acv058","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T10:48:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-5843"],"journal":"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology","last_mentioned_on":1453278318,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26446834?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer854d9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/acn.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/31\/1\/8.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"26446834","pubdate":"2015-10-09T22:00:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Video Teleconference Administration of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/video-teleconference-administration-repeatable-battery-assessment-neuropsychological-status"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":5230635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":990465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236744,"mean":9.2652696383842,"rank":161816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236744,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":2.6074559386973,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":17.5215,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
