At the end of this year, 242 medical students undertook a 16 station Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). One station assessed the locomotor screening examination, while six stations assessed the examination of other systems. The students completed a five point likert scale, self rating their confidence in each of the skills assessed at this time. Pre-registration house officers (PRHOs) at two London hospitals were invited to undertake the same OSCE and self rating.\nThe students performed the locomotor screen well (mean station score 80%). Three body systems were examined better and one significantly worse (p<0.05). 22\/40 PRHOs undertook the assessment. Compared with the students they examined the locomotor system (mean score 20%, p<0.001), but not other systems, less well. The PRHOs felt less confident (p<0.05) examining the locomotor system (mean rating 3.6\/5) than the other systems (mean rating 4.6\/5), while no significant difference in confidence ratings was seen for the students.\nStudents who are taught the GALS screen as part of the curriculum, perform it well in an end of year OSCE, as confidently as other systems, and to a higher standard than PRHOs. Further study is required to determine whether this benefit persists, overcoming the poor skills and confidence in locomotor examination of existing PRHOs, not previously taught a GALS screen.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a32","authors":["R A Fox","J E Dacre","C L Ingham Clark","A D Scotland"],"doi":"10.1136\/ard.59.9.668","endpage":"671","first_seen_on":"2015-10-08T18:03:49+00:00","issns":["0003-4967","1468-2060","00034967"],"issue":"9","journal":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1444327305,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/ard.59.9.668"],"pmcid":"PMC1753279","pmid":"10976078","pubdate":"2000-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"668","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Impact on medical students of incorporating GALS screen teaching into the medical school curriculum","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/ard.59.9.668","volume":"59","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-medical-students-incorporating-gals-screen-teaching-medical-school-curriculum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8022450,"mean":6.7899936799808,"rank":791516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7198800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8022450,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241432,"mean":9.4486828369182,"rank":33423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":207191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241432,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3160,"mean":7.8994080405191,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3160,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":14.274825,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"What do they need to know: achieving consensus on paediatric musculoskeletal content for medical students","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22953083838&p=1pl&v=1&x=i3A1Pr31k-Sh-KwHsKJC-w","license":"public","citation_ids":[792134,4601930,889535,4601933,4601935,4601936,1167160,1292771,4601939,786842,221106,4601941,4601943,4601944,4601945,4601946,4601948,2655202,4601949,5441426,4601951,2035745,3524239,4601954,4601955,4601956,2458045,4601959,4601961,4601962,4601963,4601966,4601967,4601968,505354,4601969,4601970,544433],"posted_on":"2015-10-08T18:01:45+00:00","summary":"Gunz AC, Canizares M, Mackay C, Badley EM.
