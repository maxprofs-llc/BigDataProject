These effects occur on a cellular level but range up to the organ scale, and they commonly involve attenuation of hormone homeostasis and deployment of effector proteins with varying activities to modify host cell processes. This review focuses on the cellular-reprogramming mechanisms of filamentous and bacterial plant pathogens that exhibit a biotrophic lifestyle for part, if not all, of their lifecycle in association with the host. We also highlight strategies for exploiting our growing knowledge of microbial host reprogramming to study plant processes other than immunity and to explore alternative strategies for durable plant resistance. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology Volume 31 is October 06, 2015.
