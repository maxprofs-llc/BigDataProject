We assessed synaptic and network characteristics in Neuroligin-4 knockout mice, focusing on the hippocampus as a model brain region with a critical role in cognition and memory, and found that Neuroligin-4 deletion causes subtle defects of the protein composition and function of GABAergic synapses in the hippocampal CA3 region. Interestingly, these subtle synaptic changes are accompanied by pronounced perturbations of \u03b3-oscillatory network activity, which has been implicated in cognitive function and is altered in multiple psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our data provide important insights into the mechanisms by which Neuroligin-4-dependent GABAergic synapses may contribute to autism phenotypes and indicate new strategies for therapeutic approaches.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Hammer, Matthieu","Krueger-Burg, Dilja","Tuffy, Liam Patrick","Cooper, Benjamin Hillman","Taschenberger, Holger","Goswami, Sarit Pati","Ehrenreich, Hannelore","Jonas, Peter","Varoqueaux, Frederique","Rhee, Jeong-Seop","Brose, Nils"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.celrep.2015.09.011","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T01:10:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2211-1247","22111247"],"journal":"Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1445248706,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2211124715010220","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S2211124715010220&_version=1&md5=eb4bfab40f8d9cbbddd31beac04766e4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26456829?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/abstract\/S2211-1247(15)01022-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2211124715010220\/pdf","pmid":"26456829","pubdate":"2015-10-13T11:10:44+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Perturbed Hippocampal Synaptic Inhibition and \u03b3-Oscillations in a Neuroligin-4 Knockout Mouse Model of Autism","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perturbed-hippocampal-synaptic-inhibition-oscillations-neuroligin4-knockout-mouse-model-autism-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8326478,"mean":7.0165631779127,"rank":3315241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4984207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8326478,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244048,"mean":9.5794975066278,"rank":78607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":164046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244048,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3933,"mean":22.655270091556,"rank":2702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3933,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239,"mean":17.041613445378,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
