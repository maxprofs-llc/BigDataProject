Rarely, SHML can be associated with autoimmune findings. Such cases are often treatment resistant and have high rates of morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a patient with long-standing autoimmunity in the context of SHML, dependent on standard-treatment until he was transitioned to novel monotherapy with sirolimus. Sirolimus treatment resulted in a complete remission, now sustained after discontinuation of all treatments for over 23 months, with no observable long-term sequelae.
