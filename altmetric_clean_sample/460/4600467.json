This study explores the potential interspecific covariation of geographic range (Rapoport's rule) and body size (Bergmann's rule) with latitude in North American sucker fishes (Cypriniformes: Catostomidae). While numerous tests of Rapoport's and Bergmann's rules are documented in the literature, comparatively few of these studies have specifically tested for these patterns, and none have incorporated information reflecting shared ancestry into analyses of North American freshwater fish through a hierarchical model. This study utilized a hierarchical modeling approach with Bayesian inference to evaluate the role that evolution has played in shaping these distributional corollaries. Rapoport's rule was supported at the tribe level but not across family and subfamily groupings. Particularly within the Catostominae subfamily, two tribes reflected strong support for Rapoport's rule while two suggested a pattern was present. Conversely, Bergmann's rule was not supported in Catostomidae. This study provides additional information regarding the pervasiveness of these \"rules\" by expanding inferences in freshwater fishes and specifically addressing the potential for these macroecological patterns to play a role in the distribution of the understudied group Catostomidae.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b4570","authors":["Jacquemin, Stephen J","Doll, Jason C"],"doi":"10.1002\/ece3.1637","first_seen_on":"2015-10-08T12:20:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-7758"],"issue":"18","journal":"Ecology and Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1444306802,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26445650?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4588661","pmid":"26445650","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Macroecology of North American suckers (Catostomidae): tests of Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/macroecology-north-american-suckers-catostomidae-tests-bergmanns-rapoports-rules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242651,"mean":5.9551123234541,"rank":5305154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242651,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193650,"mean":10.213591529004,"rank":152380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193650,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":4.6741327885598,"rank":841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.0686,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
