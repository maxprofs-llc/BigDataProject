This information allows regulators to decide whether biotech crops present a risk to biodiversity, since crossing between domesticated crops and their wild relatives could affect the adaptations of the wild species. The criteria that should be used in the evaluation of African crops for ERA include growth habit, center of origin, center of genetic diversity, proximity of wild relatives, inter-fertility, mode of pollen dispersal, length of pollen viability, mating system, invasiveness, weediness, mode of propagation, mode of seed dispersal, and length of seed dormancy. In this paper, we discuss the crops being genetic engineered in Africa and describe the crop biology of those with native relatives.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b4567","authors":["Akinbo, Olalekan","Hancock, James F.","Makinde, Diran"],"doi":"10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00150","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T11:42:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2296-4185"],"journal":"Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1444390959,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00150\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fbioe.2015.00150\/pdf","pmid":"26501055","pubdate":"2015-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Relevance of Crop Biology for Environmental Risk Assessment of Genetically Modified Crops in Africa","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relevance-crop-biology-environmental-risk-assessment-genetically-modified-crops-africa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242237,"mean":5.9545972071566,"rank":4616543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":937462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242237,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194397,"mean":10.234361478631,"rank":132329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194397,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":2.3680566572238,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":1.612,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
