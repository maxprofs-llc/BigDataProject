Topography and tomography data were obtained by SS-OCT (Casia SS1000) and reviewed retrospectively. Receiver operating characteristics were performed for Casia SS1000 integrated automated parameters and newly computed indices. Additionally, discriminant functions were calculated for the automated single parameters, the computed indices, and the combination of both.\nAn accuracy \u22650.7 was reached for 28 (8 automated and 20 newly computed parameters) of 785 parameters. Fourier analysis posterior higher-order irregular astigmatism revealed the highest accuracy with 0.81. By combining automated parameters with the newly computed indices in 1 discriminant function, an area under the curve of 0.92 with a corresponding accuracy of 0.85 was achieved.\nSS-OCT is able to discriminate between NE and scKCE with high accuracy. Automated single parameters and newly computed indices were combined to further improve this accuracy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610006ff6","authors":["Steinberg, Johannes","Casagrande, Maria K","Frings, Andreas","Katz, Toam","Druchkiv, Vasyl","Richard, Gisbert","Linke, Stephan J"],"doi":"10.1097\/ico.0000000000000568","first_seen_on":"2015-10-11T03:05:49+00:00","issns":["1536-4798","0277-3740"],"issue":"11","journal":"Cornea : The Journal of Cornea and External Disease","last_mentioned_on":1444532730,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/corneajrnl\/Abstract\/2015\/11000\/Screening_for_Subclinical_Keratoconus_Using.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/corneajrnl\/2015\/11000\/Screening_for_Subclinical_Keratoconus_Using.15.pdf","pmid":"26312618","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1413","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Screening for Subclinical Keratoconus Using Swept-Source Fourier Domain Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-subclinical-keratoconus-using-sweptsource-fourier-domain-anterior-segment-optical-coherenc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":5295367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193771,"mean":10.300766919544,"rank":152299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193771,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1068,"mean":2.0216551077788,"rank":727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1068,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":0.99009433962264,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
