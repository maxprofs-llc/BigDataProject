This analysis evaluated the gastroprotective efficacy and safety of the single-tablet combination of ibuprofen\/famotidine compared with ibuprofen alone on the basis of age and the presence of one or more risk factors for development of upper GI ulcer.\nPooled data from the 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group REDUCE-1 and REDUCE-2 trials were used. Endoscopies were performed in patients aged 40-80 years. The proportion of patients who developed \u22651 upper GI ulcer during treatment with ibuprofen\/famotidine versus ibuprofen alone stratified on the basis of age (<60 or \u226560 years) was evaluated. Further, analyses were performed on additional risk factors for ulcer development.\nGastroprotective efficacy of the combination was not affected by age. Pooled results demonstrated statistically significantly fewer upper GI (10.0 vs 19.5%, p < 0.0001), gastric (8.9 vs 16.8%, p = 0.0004), and duodenal ulcers (1.1 vs 5.4%, p < 0.0001) in patients <60 years treated with ibuprofen\/famotidine versus ibuprofen alone compared with 12.9 vs 26.6% (p = 0.0002), 11.9 vs 23.4% (p = 0.0011), and 1.0 vs 4.5% (p = 0.0096), respectively, in patients \u226560 years. The ibuprofen\/famotidine combination provided nearly 51 and 59% reduction in the risk of developing a GI ulcer in patients <60 years and \u226560 of age, respectively. Efficacy was maintained in the presence of additional risk factors, as well.\nThese results indicate that the fixed-combination of ibuprofen\/famotidine provides gastroprotection in those of older age, with or without additional risk factors for the development of upper GI ulcers, as compared with ibuprofen alone.
