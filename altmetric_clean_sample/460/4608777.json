Surprisingly, little is known about the ability of these therapies to stimulate antitumor CD4(+) T cells. We examined tumor-specific CD4(+) T cell responses after peri-tumoral administration of the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), or the danger signal monosodium urate crystals in combination with Mycobacterium smegmatis (MSU + Msmeg) in mice. Both treatments delayed tumor growth, however, only MSU + Msmeg induced proliferation of tumor-specific CD4(+) T cells in the draining lymph node (dLN). In line with the proliferation data, administration of MSU + Msmeg, but not poly I:C, enhanced the infiltration of CD4(+)FoxP3(-) T cells into the tumor, increased their capacity to produce IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and decreased PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells. Induction of CD4(+) T cell proliferation by treatment with MSU + Msmeg required IL-1\u03b2R signaling, as it was blocked by administration of the IL-1\u03b2R antagonist Anakinra. In addition, treatment with Anakinra or with anti-CD4 also reversed the increased survival after tumor challenge in MSU + Msmeg treated mice. Thus, peri-tumoral treatment with MSU + Msmeg results in IL-1\u03b2R-dependent priming of antitumor CD4(+) T cells in the LN, with consequent superior activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells within the tumor, and sustained antitumor activity.","authors":["Kuhn, Sabine","Yang, Jianping","Hyde, Evelyn J","Harper, Jacquie L","Kirman, Joanna R","Ronchese, Franca"],"doi":"10.1080\/2162402x.2015.1042199","first_seen_on":"2015-10-10T12:12:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2162-4011"],"issue":"10","journal":"Oncoimmunology","last_mentioned_on":1444525802,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26451307?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26451307","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"IL-1\u03b2R-dependent priming of antitumor CD4(+) T cells and sustained antitumor immunity after peri-tumoral treatment with MSU and mycobacteria.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il1%CE%B2rdependent-priming-antitumor-cd4supsup-t-cells-sustained-antitumor-immunity-after-peritumoral-tr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
