We conducted a systematic review of English-language articles published from 1980 onward using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, and Google Scholar, and by identifying studies cited in the references of published articles. Search terms were PIA defined as \u22651 of the following: placenta previa, placenta accreta, vasa previa, and velamentous cord insertion. Observational and experimental studies were included for review if data were available regarding any of the aforementioned PIA and regarding gestational age at delivery or preterm delivery. Case reports and case series were excluded. Studies were reviewed and data extracted. The primary outcome was gestational age at delivery or preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes included birthweight, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, neonatal and perinatal death, and small for gestational age. Of the 1421 studies identified, 79 met the defined criteria; 56 studies were descriptive and 23 were comparative. Based on the descriptive studies, the preterm delivery rates for low-lying\/marginal placenta, placenta previa, placenta accreta, vasa previa, and velamentous cord insertion were 26.9%, 43.5%, 57.7%, 81.9%, and 37.5%, respectively. Based on the comparative studies using controls, there was decreased pregnancy duration for every PIA; more specifically, there was an increased risk for preterm delivery in patients with placenta previa (risk ratio [RR], 5.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.39-6.45), vasa previa (RR, 3.36; 95% CI, 2.76-4.09), and velamentous cord insertion (RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.67-2.28). Risks of NICU admissions (RR, 4.09; 95% CI, 2.80-5.97), neonatal death (RR, 5.44; 95% CI, 3.03-9.78), and perinatal death (RR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.41-6.43) were higher with placenta previa. Perinatal risks were also higher in patients with vasa previa (perinatal death rate RR, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.77-7.39) and velamentous cord insertion (NICU admissions [RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.68-1.84], small for gestational age [RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.56-1.82], and perinatal death [RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.84-2.52]). In singleton gestations, there is a strong association between PIA and preterm delivery resulting in significant perinatal morbidity and mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","authors":["Vahanian, Sevan A","Lavery, Jessica A","Ananth, Cande V","Vintzileos, Anthony","Sevan A.
