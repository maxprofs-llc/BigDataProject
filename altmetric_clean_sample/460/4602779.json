Recent studies suggest that Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) recognize and are recruited to their genomic target sites through a range of different mechanisms, which involve transcription factors, CpG island elements and non-coding RNAs. Together with the realization that the interplay between PRC1 and PRC2 is more intricate than was previously appreciated, this has increased our understanding of the vertebrate Polycomb system at the molecular level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316d","authors":["Neil P.
