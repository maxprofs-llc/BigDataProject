Despite three decades of research that have elucidated the transcriptional regulation, post-translational modifications and functions of Bmi-1 in regulating the DNA damage response, cellular bioenergetics, and pathologies, the entire potential of a protein with such varied function remains to be realized. This review attempts to synthesize the current knowledge on Bmi-1 with an emphasis on its role in both normal physiology and cancer. Additionally, since cancer stem cells are emerging as a new paradigm for therapy resistance, the role of Bmi-1 in this perspective is also highlighted. The wide spectrum of malignancies that implicate Bmi-1 as a signature for stemness and oncogenesis also make it a suitable candidate for therapy. Nonetheless new approaches are vitally needed to further characterize physiological roles of Bmi-1 with the long-term goal of using Bmi-1 as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b45c6","authors":["Bhattacharya, Resham","Mustafi, Soumyajit Banerjee","Street, Mark","Dey, Anindya","Dwivedi, Shailendra Kumar Dhar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gendis.2015.04.001","endpage":"239","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T10:02:26+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2352-3042","23523042"],"issue":"3","journal":"Genes & Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1444743010,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26448339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26448339"],"pmid":"26448339","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"225","title":"Bmi-1: At the crossroads of physiological and pathological biology.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bmi1-crossroads-physiological-pathological-biology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237522,"mean":5.9780720020044,"rank":4612832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":936121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237522,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194147,"mean":10.265366579791,"rank":132057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194147,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":2.3070810810811,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
