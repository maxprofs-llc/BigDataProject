However, the molecular mechanisms regulating Treg function remain poorly understood. Here we assessed the role of IL-7, a key cytokine regulating T-cell homeostasis, in suppressor capacity of Treg. Using a skin allograft model in which transplant acceptance is controlled by the number of transferred Treg, we find that Treg impair the proliferation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells, decrease production of IFN\u03b3 by effector T cells, and prevent early and increase late IL-7 induction by lymph node stromal cells. Increased IL-7 availability enhanced Treg survival, stabilized Treg molecular signature, enhanced surface IL-2R\u03b1 expression, and improved IL-2 binding of Treg, which diminished proliferation of alloreactive CD4(+) T cells. Sequestration of IL-7 or impairment of IL-7R signaling after allograft transplantation abolished Treg-mediated tolerance by limiting their suppressive capacity. Aged Il7r\u03b1-\u0394Treg mice displayed mild symptoms of autoimmunity correlating with impaired expansion of effector Treg in response to IL-2. Thus, IL-7R signaling on Treg supports the functional activity of effector Treg by increasing their IL-2 sensitivity in the lymph node during peripheral and allograft tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Schmaler, Mathias","Broggi, Maria A S","Lagarde, Nad\u00e8ge","St\u00f6cklin, Benjamin F","King, Carolyn G","Finke, Daniela","Rossi, Simona W"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1510045112","first_seen_on":"2015-10-10T10:13:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1455793450,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26450881?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26450881","pubdate":"2015-10-10T22:00:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"IL-7R signaling in regulatory T cells maintains peripheral and allograft tolerance in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il7r-signaling-regulatory-t-cells-maintains-peripheral-allograft-tolerance-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":5428034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236493,"mean":9.3272663176767,"rank":162252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":41289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236493,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42966,"mean":22.123403886885,"rank":39323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42966,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":949,"mean":57.911251054852,"rank":859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":949,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
