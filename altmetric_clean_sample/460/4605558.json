Twenty healthy young men participated. A submaximal test based on a prior maximal test (25 watt\/min, medium ramp) was performed with an individual slow-ramp protocol (6-17 watt\/min, slow ramp), in which the time to reach the VT workload was estimated to be 10\u200aminutes. The LT was determined visually by detecting a rise above the resting value, without or with log-log transformation (LT1, LT2). The point at which the blood lactate exceeded the minimal difference (LMD) of 2 resting values was also calculated.The VT appeared significantly earlier under the slow-ramp protocol compared to the medium-ramp protocol (from 19.3\u200a\u00b1\u200a3.9 to 15.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a4.0\u200amL\/kg\/min VO2, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The mean LT1 and LT2 values appeared even earlier than the VT (LT1, P\u200a=\u200a0.004; LT2, P\u200a=\u200a0.002) (LT1, 11.9; LT2, 13.4; LMD, 17.0; VT, 15.0\u200amL\/kg\/min VO2). As the mean % of peak VO2, each occurred at 29.9%, 33.7%, 42.5%, and 37.8%. The VT correlated significantly with LT1, LT2, and LMD (r\u200a=\u200a0.61, 0.64, 0.80; P\u200a=\u200a0.004, 0.002, <0.001). Mean blood lactate showed a similar trend (1.30, 1.43, 1.81, 1.68\u200ammol\/L, respectively). Furthermore, the \u0394VO2\/\u0394 work rate slope increased (from 10.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.9 to 11.5\u200a\u00b1\u200a0.9; P\u200a=\u200a0.01) with the slow ramp, and the lower LT was associated with the greater increase in slope (LT1, r\u200a=\u200a-0.47, P\u200a=\u200a0.03; LT2, r\u200a=\u200a-0.59, P\u200a=\u200a0.005), that is, the lower LT was an indication that on the faster medium ramp the slope would decrease. The LMD and VT did not show this relation.Under slow-ramp exercise testing in healthy young men, the VT appeared earlier than under medium-ramp exercise testing. In addition, the LT appeared even earlier (at approximately 30% of peak VO2) than the VT, although they correlated. This very early onset of LT was, however, associated with evidence of reduced oxygen uptake kinetics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Kominami, Kazuyuki","Nishijima, Hirotaka","Imahashi, Keiko","Katsuragawa, Toko","Murakami, Mitsuyo","Yonezawa, Kazuya","Akino, Masatoshi"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000001559","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T12:42:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5964","0025-7974"],"issue":"39","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1444614174,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/09050\/Very_Early_Lactate_Threshold_in_Healthy_Young_Men.26.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/09050\/Very_Early_Lactate_Threshold_in_Healthy_Young_Men.26.aspx?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/2015\/09050\/Very_Early_Lactate_Threshold_in_Healthy_Young_Men.26.pdf","pmid":"26426626","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e1559","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Very Early Lactate Threshold in Healthy Young Men as Related to Oxygen Uptake Kinetics","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/very-early-lactate-threshold-healthy-young-men-related-oxygen-uptake-kinetics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":4382393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1622798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194067,"mean":10.25403936805,"rank":123215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":62070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194067,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3171,"mean":2.3090675078864,"rank":1419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3171,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296,"mean":1.5410169491525,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
