However, therapeutic alliance has not been studied in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting.\nTo explore the relationships among caregiver-reported therapeutic alliance and psychological distress as well as patient, caregiver, and ICU clinician factors.\nIn this cross-sectional study, we enrolled consecutive patient caregivers of mechanically ventilated patients discharged from all intensive care units at Duke University and the Medical University of South Carolina Hospitals between December 2013 and August 2014.\nCaregivers completed an in-person, hospital-based interview that included measures of therapeutic alliance with the ICU physicians (Human Connection Scale (HCS)) as well as patient centeredness of care; symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress; decisional conflict; and quality of communication. We performed a multivariate regression to characterize associations between HCS scores and key variables. A total of 56 caregivers were included in these exploratory analyses. Patients were largely disabled (47%) and Medicare insured (53%). Caregivers were highly educated and generally had high therapeutic alliance (median 55; interquartile range 48, 58) with the ICU clinicians. Therapeutic alliance was strongly correlated with patient-centeredness (r=0.78) and poorly correlated with psychological distress (r <0.2). Stepwise multivariate modeling revealed that higher therapeutic alliance was associated with fewer baseline patient comorbidities as well as caregiver report of greater trust in the ICU team, better quality of communication, and less decisional conflict (all p <0.012).\nTherapeutic alliance encompasses measures of trust, communication, and cooperation, which are intuitive to forming a good working relationship. Therapeutic alliance among ICU caregivers is strongly associated with both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Our exploratory study highlights new intervention targets that may inform strategies for improving the quality of the caregiver-clinician interaction.","altmetric_jid":"56f0022b2a83ee4d548b4567","authors":["Huff, Nidhi G","Nadig, Nandita","Ford, Dee W","Cox, Christopher E","Nidhi G Huff","Nandita Nadig","Dee W Ford","Christopher E Cox"],"doi":"10.1513\/annalsats.201507-408oc","first_seen_on":"2015-10-10T16:01:00+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["2325-6621","2329-6933"],"journal":"Annals of the American Thoracic Society","last_mentioned_on":1447689416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26452172?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1513\/AnnalsATS.201507-408OC","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1513\/AnnalsATS.201507-408OC?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&","http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1513\/AnnalsATS.201507-408OC?af=R&"],"pmid":"26452172","pubdate":"2015-10-10T22:00:08+00:00","title":"Therapeutic Alliance between the Caregivers of Critical Illness Survivors and Intensive Care Unit Clinicians","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.atsjournals.org\/doi\/10.1513\/AnnalsATS.201507-408OC","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-alliance-between-caregivers-critical-illness-survivors-intensive-care-unit-clinicians"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7415463,"mean":6.4484763463112,"rank":1451550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5953209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7415463,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237245,"mean":9.3669023621251,"rank":55547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":181326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237245,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":780,"mean":8.3600154043646,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":780,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":4.7810810810811,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
