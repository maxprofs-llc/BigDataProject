A second survey was made of general practice trainers in the UK.\nQuestionnaires were returned by 1624 trainees, representing 70% of all trainees known to be in a training practice on 1 April 1992. Of the 1075 responders who were at the end of their trainee year, 35% had not received any tutorials on rheumatological topics with their trainer, and only 43% had experienced specific rheumatology teaching on local day release courses. Although 84% of these trainees had injected or aspirated the knee, fewer than 40% had acquired shoulder injection skills. Lack of experience was matched by low reported confidence. Trainees rated the amount of their rheumatology education as inadequate. Nine hundred trainers returned questionnaires--a response rate of 33%. Their estimate of the amount of local training provided was similar to that among the trainees, but this sample of trainers reported a higher level of practical teaching than the trainees indicated they had received.\nRheumatology education during vocational training needs to be improved, particularly the component provided by trainers and local day release courses. This process might be facilitated by the development of a standard rheumatology curriculum which could be incorporated into all training schemes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a32","authors":["P Lanyon","D Pope","P Croft"],"doi":"10.1136\/ard.54.9.735","endpage":"739","first_seen_on":"2015-10-08T18:03:37+00:00","issns":["0003-4967","1468-2060"],"issue":"9","journal":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1444327305,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/ard.54.9.735"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/content\/54\/9\/735.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1009989","pmid":"7495345","pubdate":"1995-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"735","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Rheumatology education and management skills in general practice: a national study of trainees.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ard.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/ard.54.9.735","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rheumatology-education-management-skills-general-practice-national-study-trainees-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8022450,"mean":6.7899936799808,"rank":791515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7198799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8022450,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241432,"mean":9.4486828369182,"rank":33423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":207191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241432,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3160,"mean":7.8994080405191,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3160,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":14.274825,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"What do they need to know: achieving consensus on paediatric musculoskeletal content for medical students","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22953083838&p=1pl&v=1&x=i3A1Pr31k-Sh-KwHsKJC-w","license":"public","citation_ids":[792134,4601930,889535,4601933,4601935,4601936,1167160,1292771,4601939,786842,221106,4601941,4601943,4601944,4601945,4601946,4601948,2655202,4601949,5441426,4601951,2035745,3524239,4601954,4601955,4601956,2458045,4601959,4601961,4601962,4601963,4601966,4601967,4601968,505354,4601969,4601970,544433],"posted_on":"2015-10-08T18:01:45+00:00","summary":"Gunz AC, Canizares M, Mackay C, Badley EM.
