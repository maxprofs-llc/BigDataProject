Lpar3(-\/-) female mice had delayed embryo implantation. Their serum progesterone and estrogen levels were comparable with control on Gestation Day 3.5 (D3.5) at 11:00 h. There was reduced cell proliferation in D3.5 and D4.5 Lpar3(-\/-) stroma. Progesterone receptor (PGR) disappeared from D4.5 Lpar3+\/+ uterine luminal epithelium (LE) but remained highly expressed in D4.5 Lpar3(-\/-) LE. Pgr and PGR target genes, but not estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha\/Esr1) or ESR target genes, were upregulated in D4.5 Lpar3(-\/-) LE. It was hypothesized that suppression of PGR activity in LE could restore on-time uterine receptivity in Lpar3(-\/-) mice. A low dose of RU486 (5 \u00b5g\/mouse) given on D3.5 at 9:00 h rescued delayed implantation in all pregnant Lpar3(-\/-) females and significantly increased number of implantation sites compared to vehicle-treated pregnant Lpar3(-\/-) females detected on D4.5. E2 (25 ng\/mouse) had a similar effect as 5 \u00b5g RU486 on embryo implantation in Lpar3(-\/-) females. However, when the ovaries were removed on late D2.5 to create an experimentally-induced delayed implantation model, 25 ng E2 activated implantation in Lpar3(+\/+) but not Lpar3(-\/-) females detected on D4.5. These results demonstrate that deletion of Lpar3 leads to an increased ratio of progesterone signaling \/ estrogen signaling that can be optimized by low doses of RU486 or E2 to restore on-time implantation in Lpar3(-\/-) females.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c6e","authors":["Honglu Diao","Rong Li","Ahmed E.
