There have also been advances in imaging modalities and techniques that may help to better elucidate the disease process in eyes with VKH disease.\nVKH disease is an autoimmune, multisystem inflammatory disorder, the cause of which is still incompletely understood. Continued research may elucidate the causes and triggers of immune dysregulation in this disease, and in doing so, identify novel therapeutic targets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005866","authors":["Burkholder, Bryn M"],"doi":"10.1097\/icu.0000000000000206","first_seen_on":"2015-10-09T20:30:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1040-8738","1531-7021"],"issue":"6","journal":"Current opinion in ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1446773956,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-ophthalmology\/Abstract\/2015\/11000\/Vogt_Koyanagi_Harada_disease.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-ophthalmology\/2015\/11000\/Vogt_Koyanagi_Harada_disease.12.pdf","pmid":"26448042","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"506","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Vogt\u2212Koyanagi\u2212Harada disease","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vogtkoyanagiharada-disease-45"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535212,"mean":6.0548114281224,"rank":4593428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1701866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535212,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207950,"mean":10.074900797792,"rank":133364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":64772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207950,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":2.5468423326134,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.835,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
