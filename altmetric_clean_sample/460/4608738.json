In buds sampled on January 10th and on February 7th in 2014, 6,978 and 7,096 genes, respectively, were significantly differentially expressed in the TH3 and 'Hengshanli' libraries. A comparative GO analysis revealed that oxidation-reduction process (biological process) and ATP binding (molecular function), were overrepresented during the ecodormancy period (EP) when compared to the endodormancy deepest period (DP), indicating that ATP synthesis was activated during the transition between these dormancy stages. Among the 11 differently expressed genes (DEGs) annotated as probable dehydrins or LEA protein-related genes, 9 DEGs showed higher transcript levels in the DP than in the EP. In order to focus on transcription factors induced by low temperature or drought, 7 differently expressed genes (DEGs) annotated as probable ICE1 or DREB proteins were analyzed by real-time PCR. Expression levels of 3 genes were higher in TH3 than in 'Hengshanli' on all sampling days. Their expression increased during the endodormancy deepest period (DP) and then decreased before endodormancy breaking in TH3 buds. Taken together, these results suggest that these genes annotated as ICE1, DREB and ERF are involved in endodormancy maintenance and in the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Takemura, Yoshihiro","Kuroki, Katsuou","Shida, Yoji","Araki, Shungo","Takeuchi, Yukari","Tanaka, Keisuke","Ishige, Taichiro","Yajima, Shunsuke","Tamura, Fumio"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0139595","first_seen_on":"2015-10-10T12:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1444478415,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26451604"],"pmid":"26451604","pubdate":"2015-10-10T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of the Less-Dormant Taiwanese Pear and the Dormant Japanese Pear during Winter Season.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-transcriptome-analysis-lessdormant-taiwanese-pear-dormant-japanese-pear-during-winter-se"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6234671,"mean":5.9620126845545,"rank":2929665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1859780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6234671,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192915,"mean":10.289501736525,"rank":102581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":70470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192915,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98165,"mean":9.7528154924412,"rank":56402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":31200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98165,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5794,"mean":8.8128189193855,"rank":3381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5794,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
