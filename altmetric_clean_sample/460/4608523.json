Recent advances in functional genomics technologies and computational approaches to decipher regulatory networks, and the comparison of these networks among these and other Ascomycete species, have revealed both unique and shared strategies in adaptation to a human commensal\/opportunistic pathogen lifestyle and antifungal drug resistance in C. glabrata. Recently, several C. glabrata sister species in the Nakeseomyces clade representing both human associated (commensal) and environmental isolates have had their genomes sequenced and analyzed. This has paved the way for comparative functional genomics studies to characterize the regulatory networks in these species to identify informative patterns of conservation and divergence linked to phenotypic evolution in the Nakaseomyces lineage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c6","authors":["Roy, Sushmita","Thompson, Dawn"],"doi":"10.1093\/femsyr\/fov087","first_seen_on":"2015-10-10T10:30:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1567-1364"],"journal":"FEMS Yeast Research","last_mentioned_on":1444487615,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26449820?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26449820","pubdate":"2015-10-10T22:00:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Evolution of regulatory networks in Candida glabrata: learning to live with the human host.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-regulatory-networks-candida-glabrata-learning-live-human-host"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6240950,"mean":5.9590492029356,"rank":2742465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3332369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6240950,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193073,"mean":10.283677353526,"rank":93097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":91614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193073,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":386,"mean":1.7390701298701,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":386,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4846153846154,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
