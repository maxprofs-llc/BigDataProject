In some complex cases, the use of the single stent technique might not be sufficient or may not be feasible. The kissing-Y stenting technique appears to be an alternative endovascular treatment option. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the kissing-Y stenting technique on vascular angular remodeling.\n21 patients with wide necked intracranial bifurcation aneurysms at different sites (10 anterior communicating artery, 6 middle cerebral artery, 3 basilar artery, 1 vertebral artery\/posterior inferior cerebellar artery, 1 internal carotid artery\/posterior communicating artery) were treated with 44 closed cell stents (follow-up 2012-2016) using the kissing-Y stenting technique. We analyzed vascular angle geometry between the mother and both affected daughter vessels by digital subtraction angiography, before and after stent deployment, using standard working projections.\nEndovascular treatment of wide necked intracranial aneurysms using the kissing-Y stenting technique significantly decreased the angle between the bifurcation branches from 130.4\u00b19.5\u00b0 to 91.5\u00b19.1\u00b0 (p<0.0001).\nKissing-Y stenting in wide necked bifurcation aneurysms leads to vascular angular remodeling of both affected branches. The resulting straightening of the bifurcation angle may prevent aneurysmal recurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f61000406e","authors":["Katharina Melber","Dan Meila","Philipp Draheim","Dominik Grieb","Bj\u00f6rn Greling","Martin Schlunz-Hendann","Friedhelm Brassel"],"doi":"10.1136\/neurintsurg-2016-012858","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T18:52:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1759-8486"],"journal":"Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1481734345,"links":["http:\/\/jnis.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/05\/neurintsurg-2016-012858?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jnis.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/05\/neurintsurg-2016-012858.full.pdf","pmid":"27920207","pubdate":"2016-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","startpage":"neurintsurg-2016-012858","subjects":["generalsurgery","neurology"],"title":"Vascular angular remodeling by kissing-Y stenting in wide necked intracranial bifurcation aneurysms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vascular-angular-remodeling-kissingy-stenting-wide-necked-intracranial-bifurcation-aneurysms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":3122867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4738420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252714,"mean":12.254212596898,"rank":94897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":156410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252714,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":2.7423903614458,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":3.5213114754098,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JNIS_BMJ\/statuses\/806209766624215041","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14517206],"posted_on":"2016-12-06T18:52:41+00:00","author":{"name":"JNIS","url":"http:\/\/jnis.bmj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784397177711947776\/rBFCTGQU_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery aims to be the leading peer review journal for the field of neurointerventional surgery.","id_on_source":"JNIS_BMJ","tweeter_id":"143024637","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1348},"tweet_id":"806209766624215041"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Dr_CRdguez\/statuses\/806218876358979585","license":"gnip","rt":["JNIS_BMJ"],"citation_ids":[14517206],"posted_on":"2016-12-06T19:28:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Claudio Rodriguez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900721524541456386\/qVPEwNpV_normal.jpg","description":"Interventional Neuroradiologist.
