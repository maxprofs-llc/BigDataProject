The initial step in eukaryotic DNA replication is the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, including the formation of two head-to-head hexameric helicases around the replication origin. How these hexameric helicases interact with their origin dsDNA remains unknown. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the SV40 Large-T Antigen (LT) hexameric helicase bound to its origin dsDNA. The structure shows that the six subunits form a near-planar ring that interacts with the origin, so that each subunit makes unique contacts with the DNA. The origin dsDNA inside the narrower AAA+ domain channel shows partial melting due to the compression of the two phosphate backbones, forcing Watson-Crick base-pairs within the duplex to flip outward. This structure provides the first snapshot of a hexameric helicase binding to origin dsDNA, and suggests a possible mechanism of origin melting by LT during SV40 replication in eukaryotic cells.","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Dahai Gai","Damian Wang","Shu-Xing Li","Xiaojiang S Chen"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.18129","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T18:32:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["2050-084X"],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1487381269,"links":["https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e18129?utm_source=content_alert&utm_medium=email&utm_content=fulltext&utm_campaign=elife-alerts","https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e18129","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.18129","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5140265\/pdf\/elife-18129.pdf","https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e18129#api_box"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e18129.pdf","pmid":"27921994","pubdate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications Limited","title":"The structure of SV40 large T hexameric helicase in complex with AT-rich origin DNA","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/elifesciences.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.7554\/eLife.18129","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-sv40-large-t-hexameric-helicase-complex-atrich-origin-dna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":57.58,"score_history":{"1y":57.58,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":57.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":157168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8072200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270241,"mean":12.160800111012,"rank":10502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":259738,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270241,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4088,"mean":30.049844384634,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4088,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336,"mean":39.998214925373,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
