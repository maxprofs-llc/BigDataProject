To determine the value of early initiation of such therapy, two satellite community hospital emergency rooms were established for use of rt-PA and the experience was compared among 142 consecutive patients who were transferred to a regional center for acute cardiac catheterization after intravenous rt-PA therapy. In Group I (n = 19), patients received rt-PA after interhospital transport to the regional center, but before cardiac catheterization. In Group II (n = 70), rt-PA therapy was initiated by the helicopter physician and nurse team after their arrival at the local community hospital emergency room. Group III patients (n = 53) had rt-PA administered in the local community hospital by the emergency room physician. Group III patients had earlier initiation of therapy (2.1 +\/- 0.8 hours in Group III versus 3.8 +\/- 1.2 hours in combined Groups I and II, p less than 0.001) and an increased rate of infarct vessel recanalization on the 90 minute coronary angiogram (81 in Group III versus 67% in combined Groups I and II, p = 0.057). The patients in Group III had a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +\/- 8% versus 50 +\/- 9.5% in combined Groups I and II, p less than 0.01) and a trend toward an increased 7 day ejection fraction (55.5 +\/- 9% versus 51.7 +\/- 9.5%, respectively, p = 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f57","authors":["Eric J.
