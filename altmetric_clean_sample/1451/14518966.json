Solid polymer electrolytes, as promising candidates to solve the above issue, are expected to own high Li ion conductivity without sacrificing mechanical strength, which is still a big challenge to realize. In this study, a bifunctional solid polymer electrolyte exactly having these two merits is proposed with an interpenetrating network of poly(ether-acrylate) (ipn-PEA) and realized via photopolymerization of ion-conductive poly(ethylene oxide) and branched acrylate. The ipn-PEA electrolyte with facile processing capability integrates high mechanical strength (ca. 12 GPa) with high room-temperature ionic conductance (0.22 mS cm(-1)), and significantly promotes uniform Li plating\/stripping. Li metal full cells assembled with ipn-PEA electrolyte and cathodes within 4.5 V vs Li(+)\/Li operate effectively at a rate of 5 C and cycle stably at a rate of 1 C at room temperature. Because of its fabrication simplicity and compelling characteristics, the bifunctional ipn-PEA electrolyte reshapes the feasibility of room-temperature solid-state Li metal batteries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Xian-Xiang Zeng","Ya-Xia Yin","Nian-Wu Li","Wen-Cheng Du","Yu-Guo Guo","Li-Jun Wan"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b10088","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T21:35:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1489591037,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b10088","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jacs.6b10088"],"pmid":"27960330","pubdate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Reshaping Lithium Plating\/Stripping Behavior via Bifunctional Polymer Electrolyte for Room-Temperature Solid Li Metal Batteries","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.6b10088","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reshaping-lithium-platingstripping-behavior-via-bifunctional-polymer-electrolyte-roomtemperature-sol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":6.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":1357617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6996399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278686,"mean":12.013480711197,"rank":64424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":214003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278686,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19236,"mean":5.3126671172342,"rank":4241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":14978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19236,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":7.2554870466321,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
