One such miRNA, miR-1247, is downregulated in various cancers, but its biological role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown. This study found that the expression of miR-1247 was significantly reduced in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues compared with matched normal lung tissues and cell lines as a result of DNA hypermethylation. Overexpression of miR-1247 or demethylation by 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) treatment dramatically inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion, and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, Stathmin 1 (STMN1) was found to be an immediate and functional target of miR-1247. The expression of STMN1 was significantly increased in NSCLC cell lines but was decreased by 5-Aza treatment. In addition, miR-1247 upregulation partially inhibited STMN1-induced promotion of migration and invasion of A549 and H1299 cells. The results suggest that miR-1247 was silenced by DNA methylation. MiR-1247 and its downstream target gene STMN1 may therefore be a future target for the treatment of NSCLC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bca2","authors":["Juan Zhang","Jun Fu","Yuliang Pan","Xi Zhang","Liangfang Shen"],"doi":"10.2147\/ott.s111291","endpage":"7307","first_seen_on":"2016-12-06T16:47:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-6930"],"journal":"OncoTargets and therapy","last_mentioned_on":1480757706,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/silencing--of-mir-1247-by-dna-methylation-promoted-non-small-cell-lung-peer-reviewed-article-OTT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=33844","pmcid":"PMC5138046","pmid":"27942223","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"7297","title":"Silencing  of miR-1247 by DNA methylation promoted non-small-cell lung cancer cell invasion and migration by effects of STMN1","type":"article","volume":"Volume 9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ott111291silencingofmir1247bydnamethylationpromotednonsmall"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":6792762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250105,"mean":12.277185922656,"rank":203387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250105,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":959,"mean":1.7822860125261,"rank":622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":959,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":0.95663265306122,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Silencing of miR-1247 by DNA methylation promoted non-small-cell lung","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/5g8v7o\/silencing_of_mir1247_by_dna_methylation_promoted\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[14515538],"posted_on":"2016-12-03T09:35:06+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
