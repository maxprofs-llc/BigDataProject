Identity of Gli1+ cells in the bone marrow"],"citation":{"abstract":"Bone marrow fibrosis is a critical component of primary myelofibrosis in which normal bone marrow tissue and blood-forming cells are gradually replaced with scar tissue. The specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that cause bone marrow fibrosis are not understood. A recent study by using state-of-the-art techniques including in vivo lineage-tracing provides evidence that Gli1+ cells are the cells responsible for fibrotic disease in the bone marrow. Strikingly, genetic depletion of Gli1+ cells rescues bone marrow failure and abolishes myelofibrosis. This work brings a new central cellular target for bone marrow fibrosis. The emerging knowledge from this research will be important for the treatment of several malignant and non-malignant disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002895","authors":["Isadora Sena","Pedro Prazeres","Gabryella Santos","Isabella Borges","Patrick Azevedo","Julia Andreotti","Viviani Almeida","Ana Paiva","Daniel Guerra","Luiza Lousado","Luanny Souto","Akiva Mintz","Alexander Birbrair","Isadora F.G.
