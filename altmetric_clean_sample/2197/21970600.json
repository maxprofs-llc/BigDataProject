Patients >18 years of age who presented to a tertiary stone clinic and who would normally be counseled for 24-hour urine collection were eligible for the study. Participants completed two 24-hour urine collections, with each divided into two separate 12-hour collections. Day-time collection began after the first morning void and continued for 12 hours. The night collection proceeded for the next 12 hours through the first morning void.\n49 24-hour samples from 35 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in analysis. Overall, there was strong correlation between the night 12-hour and the 24-hour urine collections with R(2) ranging from 0.76 for pH to 0.96 for Citrate. In our analysis of variability, the night time 12-hour collection differed from the 24-hour collection by 30% in 1-9 patients (2.0-18.4%) based on individual chemistry value. Diagnosis of underlying metabolic abnormalities was concordant in 92% of patients.\nA 12-hour night-time collection has strong correlation with 24-hour urine collection. As such, simplifying the metabolic evaluation to a 12-hour overnight collection may be feasible - improving compliance and decreasing patient burden.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Hinck, Bryan D","Ganesan, Vishnuvardhan","Tarplin, Sarah","Asplin, John","Granja, Ignacio","Calle, Juan","Sivalingam, Sri","Monga, Manoj","Bryan D Hinck","Vishnuvardhan Ganesan","Sarah Tarplin","John Asplin","Ignacio Granja","Juan Calle","Sri Sivalingam","Manoj Monga"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2017.06.028","first_seen_on":"2017-07-16T15:46:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0090-4295","00904295","1527-9995"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1501055894,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(17)30649-0\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295%2817%2930649-0\/fulltext#.WW-7u_bJd4E.twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.urology.2017.06.028"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429517306490\/pdf","pmid":"28705575","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Can a Simplified 12-Hour Night Time Urine Collection Predict Urinary Stone Risk?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simplified-12hour-nighttime-urine-collection-predict-urinary-stone-risk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.9,"score_history":{"1y":10.9,"6m":10.9,"3m":10.9,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":780915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7495362,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205467,"mean":11.558623490018,"rank":29152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":176242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205467,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3271,"mean":4.1740709480122,"rank":149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3271,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":3.5089552238806,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
