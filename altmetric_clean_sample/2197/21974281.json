While fever is common after PCNL, the incidence of it progressing to urosepsis is fortunately less. Which patient undergoing PCNL is at risk of developing urosepsis and in whom aggressive treatment of fever postoperatively may prevent the progression to severe sepsis becomes a very important question. This study aims to answer these vital questions.\nThis is a single institutional, retrospective study over a period of 3 years.\nRetrospective analysis of medical records of the patients undergoing PCNL from August 2012 to July 2015 was done. A total of 580 patients were included in the study, and the study variables recorded were analyzed statistically.\nStatistical analysis was performed by Chi-square test.\nThree factors significantly correlated with postoperative severe sepsis, namely, stone size >25 mm, prolonged operative time >120 min, and significant bleeding requiring transfusion. Factors associated with fever after PCNL which did not progress to sepsis were the presence of staghorn calculi and multiple access tracts in addition to the factors listed above for sepsis.\nFever after PCNL is not uncommon but it has a low incidence of progressing to life-threatening severe sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Special precautions and monitoring should be taken in patients with bigger stone (>25 mm) and patients with severe intraoperative hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion. It is better to stage the procedure rather than prolong the operative time (120 min). Identifying these factors and minimizing them may decrease the incidence of this life-threatening complication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046e0","authors":["Bansal","Sumit Suresh Bansal","Prakash Wamanrao Pawar","Ajit S Sawant","Ashwin Sunil Tamhankar","Sunil Raghunath Patil","Gaurav Vinod Kasat"],"doi":"10.4103\/ua.ua_166_16","first_seen_on":"2017-07-16T19:34:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0974-7796"],"issue":"3","journal":"Urology Annals","last_mentioned_on":1500233651,"links":["http:\/\/www.urologyannals.com\/article.asp?issn=0974-7796;year=2017;volume=9;issue=3;spage=230;epage=233;aulast=Bansal#.WWu_kKzvASU.linkedin","http:\/\/www.urologyannals.com\/article.asp?issn=0974-7796%3Byear%3D2017%3Bvolume%3D9%3Bissue%3D3%3Bspage%3D230%3Bepage%3D233%3Baulast%3DBansal#.WWu_p6iSPUU.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.urologyannals.com\/article.asp?issn=0974-7796;year=2017;volume=9;issue=3;spage=230;epage=233;aulast=Bansal;type=2","pmcid":"PMC5532888","pmid":"28794587","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Predictive factors for fever and sepsis following percutaneous nephrolithotomy: A review of 580 patients","type":"article","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219190,"mean":6.9624096623095,"rank":7112934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219190,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179299,"mean":11.433192405939,"rank":146267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179299,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":3.2387142857143,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/886670254813925381","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21974281],"posted_on":"2017-07-16T19:33:56+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
