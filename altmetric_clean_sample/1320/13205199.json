However, changes in the economic burden of migraine in the past decade have not been examined given therapeutic advances at the national level. Therefore, we estimated cross-sectional trends in the incremental total and types of direct healthcare expenditures among individuals with migraine using a nationally representative data, the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey. The analytic sample comprised of a weighted population of 228,010,000 adults aged 18 years and older from 2004 to 2013. Two-part models were used to estimate the incremental total and types of annual direct healthcare expenditures (adjusted to 2013 US dollars) among individuals with migraine after adjusting for predisposing, enabling, need, personal health practice and external environment factors selected on the basis of Anderson Healthcare Behavior Model. The unadjusted average annual total healthcare expenditure for individuals with migraine was $8,033 (Standard Error, SE: $292) which comprised of major proportions of outpatient ($2,952, SE: $128), prescription drugs ($2,207, SE: $91), and inpatient ($1,784, SE: $178) expenditures. Individuals with migraine had $866 (SE: $298) and $1,519 (SE: $400) greater adjusted annual total direct healthcare expenditures in 2004\/2005 and 2012\/2013 as compared to those without migraine respectively. However, those with migraine in 2012\/2013 did not have significant changes in the total direct healthcare expenditures as compared to those having migraine in 2004\/2005 (changes: -$330, SE: $480). The estimated adjusted incremental total direct healthcare expenditures for individuals with migraine was approximately $9.20 billion\/year as compared to those without migraine.\nAlthough annual incremental total direct healthcare expenditures among individuals with migraine did not change significantly from 2004 to 2012, expenditures remained significantly greater in migraine population as compared to those without migraine across the years. Our study findings suggest the need to design and implement policy and interventions to reduce excess healthcare expenditures among individuals with migraine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a84","authors":["Amit D.
