Sphingosine 1-phosphate has an important role in kidney injury and pleiotropic effects in fibrosis. We investigated the involvement of sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 (SphK1 and SphK2), which phosphorylate sphingosine to produce sphingosine 1-phosphate, in kidney fibrosis induced by folic acid (FA) or unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Analysis of Masson trichrome staining and fibrotic marker protein and mRNA expression 14 days after AKI revealed that wild-type (WT) and Sphk1(-\/-) mice exhibited more kidney fibrosis than Sphk2(-\/-) mice. Furthermore, kidneys of FA-treated WT and Sphk1(-\/-) mice had greater immune cell infiltration and expression of fibrotic and inflammatory markers than kidneys of FA-treated Sphk2(-\/-) mice. In contrast, kidneys of Sphk2(-\/-) mice exhibited greater expression of Ifng and IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes (Cxcl9 and Cxcl10) than kidneys of WT or Sphk1(-\/-) mice did at this time point. Splenic T cells from untreated Sphk2(-\/-) mice were hyperproliferative and produced more IFN-\u03b3 than did those of WT or Sphk1(-\/-) mice. IFN-\u03b3 blocking antibody administered to Sphk2(-\/-) mice or deletion of Ifng (Sphk2(-\/-)Ifng(-\/-) mice) blocked the protective effect of SphK2 deficiency in fibrosis. Moreover, adoptive transfer of Sphk2(-\/-) (but not Sphk2(-\/-)Ifng(-\/-)) CD4 T cells into WT mice blocked FA-induced fibrosis. Finally, a selective SphK2 inhibitor blocked FA-induced kidney fibrosis in WT mice. These studies demonstrate that SphK2 inhibition may serve as a novel therapeutic approach for attenuating kidney fibrosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["Amandeep Bajwa","Liping Huang","Elvira Kurmaeva","Hong Ye","Krishna R.
