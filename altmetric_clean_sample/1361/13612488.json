The present synthesis supports proposals that thermodynamic information in the brain can be quantified to an appreciable degree of objectivity, that many qualitative properties of information in systems of the brain can be inferred by observing changes in thermodynamic quantities, and that many features of the brain's anatomy and architecture illustrate relatively simple information-energy relationships. The brain may provide a unique window into the relationship between energy and information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1d","authors":["Street, Sterling","Sterling Street"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00090","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T03:40:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5137"],"journal":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1504820265,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00090\/full?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00090\/full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5108784\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnsys.2016.00090\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC5108784","pmid":"27895560","pubdate":"2016-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Neurobiology as Information Physics","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neurobiology-information-physics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":4.5,"6m":3.25,"3m":2,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380430,"mean":7.062242681602,"rank":1763142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6605001,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380430,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237116,"mean":13.093069464184,"rank":69586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":167253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237116,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":759,"mean":8.6777836411609,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":759,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":26.944827586207,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
