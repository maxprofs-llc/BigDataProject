Infants were investigated following an established protocol that includes EEG, neuroimaging studies, PCR and specific antibodies for ZikV detection.\nEEGs (n=37) from 37 infants were reviewed. Age at investigation varied from 1 to 5months (mean=2.6). Diffuse low voltage (n=7), background asymmetry (n=6) and modified hypsarrhythmia with or without burst-suppression (n=11), were the main background abnormalities identified. Interictal EEG abnormalities were identified in 23 recordings (62%) and localized as focal frontal (n=8) or occipital (n=2) spikes\/sharp, multifocal spikes\/sharp waves (n=13). Electrographic seizures without clinical manifestation were identified in 4 recordings and characterized as focal pseudo rhythmic pattern. Further findings were focal high amplitude slow waves that were registered in the frontal (n=3) or occipital (n=1) regions.\nDifferent types of EEG abnormalities were encountered with a predominance of interictal epileptogenic activity and hypsarrhythmia.\nSleep EEGs in congenital Zika virus syndrome are consistently abnormal even in infants who have not yet developed epilepsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002566","authors":["Maria Durce Costa Gomes Carvalho","Dem\u00f3crito de Barros Miranda- Filho","Vanessa van der Linden","Paula Fabiana Sobral","Regina Coeli Ferreira Ramos","Maria \u00c2ngela Wanderley Rocha","Marli Ten\u00f3rio Cordeiro","Sarah Pinheiro de Alencar","Magda Lahorgue Nunes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinph.2016.11.004","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T03:50:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13882457","1872-8952"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1479181797,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1388245716306484"],"pmid":"27923187","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Sleep EEG patterns in infants with congenital Zika virus syndrome","type":"article","volume":"128","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sleep-eeg-patterns-infants-congenital-zika-virus-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":6657668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227340,"mean":12.872869124963,"rank":184101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227340,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1262,"mean":2.742287073751,"rank":1009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1262,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":3.3123404255319,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Professor":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/greg_folkers\/statuses\/798372442213388288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13612580],"posted_on":"2016-11-15T03:49:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Greg Folkers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000063259596\/220c952b0e03de1256e8135015fe9d43_normal.jpeg","description":"washington, dc || personal account || tweets\/retweets \u2260 endorsement || gregfolkers (at) yahoo (dot) com || global health\/infectious diseases","id_on_source":"greg_folkers","tweeter_id":"41626609","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":2801},"tweet_id":"798372442213388288"}]}}
