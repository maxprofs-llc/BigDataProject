CRC screening is actually based on faecal occult blood testing, and optical colonoscopy still remains the gold standard screening test for cancer detection. However, computed tomography colonography (CT colonography) constitutes a reliable, minimally-invasive method to rapidly and effectively evaluate the entire colon for clinically relevant lesions. Furthermore, even if the benefits of its employment in CRC mass screening have not fully established yet, CT colonography may represent a reasonable alternative screening test in patients who cannot undergo or refuse colonoscopy. Therefore, the purpose of our review is to illustrate the most updated recommendations on methodology and the current clinical indications of CT colonography, according to the data of the existing relevant literature.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc96","authors":["Paola Scalise","Annalisa Mantarro","Francesca Pancrazi","Emanuele Neri"],"doi":"10.4329\/wjr.v8.i5.472","first_seen_on":"2016-11-15T06:33:41+00:00","issns":["1949-8470"],"issue":"5","journal":"World Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1479191608,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4882404\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4882404","pmid":"27247713","pubdate":"2016-05-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Baishideng Publishing Group Inc","startpage":"472","title":"Computed tomography colonography for the practicing radiologist: A review of current recommendations on methodology and clinical indications","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computed-tomography-colonography-practicing-radiologist-review-current-recommendations-methodology-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695823,"mean":6.6062009433119,"rank":6657674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695823,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227341,"mean":12.872812501099,"rank":184107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227341,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.1729638554217,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":2.95,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CY":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fronimos1\/statuses\/798413591053553664","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13615366],"posted_on":"2016-11-15T06:33:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Andreas Sofroniou","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/764375886938464256\/CSbNmf25_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/Rad.Tech.","id_on_source":"fronimos1","tweeter_id":"434192863","geo":{"lt":34.675,"ln":33.03333,"country":"CY"},"followers":208},"tweet_id":"798413591053553664"}]}}
