Epidemiological and clinical data were collected daily until ICU discharge, as was the incidence of PU, either new or present on admission.\n10 general adult ICUs.\nWe evaluated 332 patients, 52.1% male, mean age 63.1 years. The most common cause of admission was medical diseases (50.3%), and the mean APACHE II score was 14.9. A total of 45 patients (13.6%) had PU; the most common sites were sacral, calcaneal, ears, and trochanter. The incidence of PU was related to predictive factors, such as the Braden Scale and length of lack of nutrition. The presence of PU was strongly related to unfavorable outcomes, such as Mechanical Ventilation (MV) duration and ICU and hospital mortality.\nPU incidence is related to severity of the patient's condition and predicted by Braden Scale score. The presence of PU is also related to adverse outcomes, such as MV duration and ICU and hospital mortality. It was also shown that patients with PU have a higher incidence of medical complications, such as acute renal failure, pneumonia, and the need for vasoactive drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005993","authors":["Delmiro Becker","Tatiane Cristiana Tozo","Saionara Savaris Batista","Andr\u00e9a Luciana Mattos","Mirian Carla Bortolamedi Silva","Sabrina Rigon","Rosane Lucia Laynes","Edilaine C.
