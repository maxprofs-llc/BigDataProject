The patients received three sessions of individualized dietary guidance. Both the control subjects and the patients were scheduled for colonoscopies at baseline and again for the patients at 3-9 months after dietary guidance. Biopsy samples were taken from the colon and rectum and were immunostained for all types of large intestinal endocrine cells. The endocrine cells were quantified using computerized image analysis.\nThe daily total consumption (mean\u00b1s.e.m. values) of fruits and vegetables rich in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) decreased significantly from 16.2\u00b15.3\u2009g before receiving dietary guidance to 9.2\u00b13.2\u2009g after receiving dietary guidance (P=0.02). In the total colon, the densities of serotonin cells were 46.8\u00b18.9, 10.5\u00b12.1 and 22.6\u00b13.2 cells\/mm(2) in control subjects and in IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.007); the corresponding densities of peptide YY cells were 11.6\u00b11.8, 10.8\u00b11.7 and 16.8\u00b12.1 cells\/mm(2), respectively (P=0.06). The cell densities for both serotonin and peptide YY did not change significantly in the rectum. The densities of somatostatin cells in the rectum were 13.5\u00b13.0, 13.2\u00b13.0, and 22.3\u00b13.2 cells\/mm(2) for control subjects and for IBS patients before and after receiving dietary guidance, respectively (P=0.01).\nThe densities of the large intestinal endocrine cells tend to normalize following dietary guidance that may have contributed to the improvement of the patients with IBS symptoms.European Journal of Clinical Nutrition advance online publication, 25 November 2015; doi:10.1038\/ejcn.2015.191.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002829","authors":["T Mazzawi","T Hausken","D Gundersen","M El-Salhy","Mazzawi, T","Hausken, T","Gundersen, D","El-Salhy, M"],"doi":"10.1038\/ejcn.2015.191","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T11:06:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0954-3007","1476-5640"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1460189153,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejcn\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ejcn2015191a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ejcn\/rss\/aop\/~3\/UwkqAOLP4FI\/ejcn.2015.191","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejcn\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/pdf\/ejcn2015191a.pdf","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejcn\/journal\/v70\/n2\/full\/ejcn2015191a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejcn\/journal\/v70\/n2\/full\/ejcn2015191a.html?WT.ec_id=EJCN-201602&spMailingID=50613450&spUserID=NjI1MTEyNzgzNAS2&spJobID=860334905&spReportId=ODYwMzM0OTA1S0#st_refDomain=&st_refQuery=","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26603880","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ejcn\/journal\/v70\/n2\/pdf\/ejcn2015191a.pdf"],"pmid":"26603880","pubdate":"2015-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical research","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nutrition disorders","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Digestive signs and symptoms","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Irritable bowel syndrome","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary guidance normalizes large intestinal endocrine cell densities in patients with irritable bowel syndrome","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-guidance-normalizes-large-intestinal-endocrine-cell-densities-patients-irritable-bowel-syndr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.648,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.648},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8354120,"mean":7.0457339159207,"rank":361247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7992920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8354120,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298801,"mean":8.9643641566263,"rank":17993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":280808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298801,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2277,"mean":12.998538664323,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2277,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":11.110975609756,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":4,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":10,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
