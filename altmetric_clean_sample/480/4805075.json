The impact of behavioral eating habits and in particular night eating syndrome (NES) have not been emphasized in the region. This study assessed the proportion of NES in an Omani Arab adult population sample.\nA night eating syndrome questionnaire (NEQ) was distributed to Omani adults above the age of 20.\nOut of the 454 respondents, 26.4\u00a0% endorsed evening hyperphagia while nocturnal ingestion was present in 4.7\u00a0% of the respondents. In addition, 1.5\u00a0% of the respondents met the NES criteria.\nThe proportion of NES in Omani adult population is similar to the reported rates in general world populations. In conclusion, night eating syndrome is present in the Omani Arab adults and should be taken into account in national management for increased obesity trends in the region.","altmetric_jid":"508ef91d3cf0580434000000","authors":["Fahad Zadjali","Aaisha Al-Bulushi","Fatma AlHassani","Mustafa Al Hinai"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40337-015-0079-6","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T10:00:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2050-2974"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Eating Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1448659321,"links":["http:\/\/www.jeatdisord.com\/content\/3\/1\/43"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jeatdisord.com\/content\/pdf\/s40337-015-0079-6.pdf","pmid":"26609364","pubdate":"2015-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"43","title":"Proportion of night eating syndrome in Arab population of Oman","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proportion-night-eating-syndrome-arab-population-oman"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6613942,"mean":6.1334676036573,"rank":4649807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1721037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6613942,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250274,"mean":9.2452941148266,"rank":158068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":80056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250274,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":8.5420829015544,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":7.3574782608696,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ThihaSwe_dr\/statuses\/669455573356781568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4805075],"posted_on":"2015-11-25T10:00:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Psychiatry Updates","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PsychiatryUpdates.by.DrThihaSwe","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3471096253\/6b7bd3fc313986902cd1574474364bae_normal.jpeg","description":"[RSS Updates from Psychiatry Journals globally, plus some mental health related news] \/ Should follow only if you are interested in Mental Health","id_on_source":"ThihaSwe_dr","tweeter_id":"1259166031","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":992},"tweet_id":"669455573356781568"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Proportion of night eating syndrome in Arab population of Oman","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=944112675659117&id=450103581726698","license":"public","citation_ids":[4805075],"posted_on":"2015-11-25T10:00:19+00:00","summary":"Journal of Eating Disorders - Latest Articles\nProportion of night eating syndrome in Arab population of Oman ObjectiveGlobally obesity has reached epidemic proportions with alarming rates in the Arabian Gulf countries.
