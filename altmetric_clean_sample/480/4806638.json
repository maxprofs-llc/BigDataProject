Herein we present the case of a 50-year-old male patient with an unlimited mass on the pancreatic corpus and tail with peripancreatic effusion and multiple metastases in the liver and spleen. A liver biopsy showed a pancreatic ACC. The patient received 9 cycles of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX regimen), which had to be stopped because of a persistent grade 2 neuropathy. A CT scan showed complete response after 14 years. At the age of 61 years, a localized prostatic cancer was diagnosed, treated by prostatectomy. The patient carried a BRCA2 mutation. None of the precedent case reports describe a chemosensibility to the GEMOX regimen. In spite of the lack of study in these patients, chemotherapy with oxaliplatin seems to be the most effective. Long survival can be expected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006df9","authors":["Ploquin, Anne","Baldini, Capucine","Vuagnat, Perrine","Makhloufi, Samira","Desauw, Christophe","Hebbar, Mohamed"],"doi":"10.1159\/000441414","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T16:16:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-6575"],"issue":"3","journal":"Case Reports in Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1448468148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26600777\/?i=1&from=brca2"],"pmcid":"PMC4649728","pmid":"26600777","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Prolonged Survival in a Patient with a Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prolonged-survival-patient-pancreatic-acinar-cell-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":5636647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250048,"mean":9.2462547841006,"rank":197954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250048,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":3.9513643410853,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.72941176470588,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
