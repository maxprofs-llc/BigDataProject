Not only is the symmetric monocationic IL-based surfactant 1,3-didodecylimidazolium bromide (C12C12Im-Br) studied for first time in m-\u03bcdSPE, but double-salt (DS) IL (DSIL)-based surfactants are also examined. Nine DSIL-based surfactants were formed by combination of C12C12Im-Br with other IL-based surfactants, including nonsymmetric monocationic and dicationic ILs combined at three different molar fractions. The analytical application was focused on the determination of a group of eight phenols, including bisphenol\u00a0A, in water samples. The best results were obtained with the DSIL formed by C12C12Im-Br (molar fraction 0.5) and 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C16MIm-Br), after proper optimization of the overall method in combination with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and diode-array detection (DAD). The optimum conditions for 100\u00a0mL of water samples require a small amount (10\u00a0mg) of Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, a low content (5.0\u00a0mg of C12C12Im-Br and 3.9\u00a0mg of C16MIm-Br) of the selected DSIL, pH\u00a011, a sonication time of 2.5\u00a0min, and an equilibration time of 5\u00a0min with the aid of NdFeB magnets, followed by elution of phenols, evaporation, and reconstitution with 0.5\u00a0mL of acetonitrile. The overall m-\u03bcdSPE-HPLC-DAD method is characterized for limits of detection down to 1.3\u00a0\u03bcg\u2009\u00b7\u2009L(-1), intraday relative standard deviations lower than 13\u00a0% (n\u2009=\u20093), and interday relative standard deviations lower than 17\u00a0% (n\u2009=\u20099), with a spiking level of 15\u00a0\u03bcg\u2009\u00b7\u2009L(-1); with enrichment factors between 15.7 and 141, and average relative recoveries of 99.9\u00a0%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224a","authors":["Mar\u00eda J.
