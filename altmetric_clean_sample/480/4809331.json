Different extracts of watercress (roots, stem and leaves) were analysed for pigment composition, total phenolic contents, and radical scavenging activity. The phenolic profile of the leaves and roots was studied using reversed phase HPLC-DAD. Results showed that total phenolic compounds in all samples were higher in the methanolic extracts than its corresponding aqueous extracts. The RSA of methanolic extracts was higher than aqueous extracts. Fourteen phenolic compounds were identified in the leaves, where coumaric acid and its derivatives, caftaric acid and quercetin derivatives were present in higher amounts. In roots, a total of 20 compounds was tentatively identified, with coumaric acid and its derivatives, sinapic acid, caftaric acid and quercetin derivatives were the major phenolic compounds. In conclusion, watercress has significant antioxidant activity and contains important phenolic compounds, which could be of potential biological interest.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Alam Zeb","Zeb, Alam"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40064-015-1514-5","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T06:19:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2193-1801"],"issue":"1","journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1501502400,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/4\/1\/714","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26636002","http:\/\/springerplus.springeropen.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40064-015-1514-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/pdf\/s40064-015-1514-5.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4656250","pmid":"26636002","pubdate":"2015-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Science, general","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"714","title":"Phenolic profile and antioxidant potential of wild watercress (Nasturtium officinale L.)","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenolic-profile-antioxidant-potential-wild-watercress-inasturtium-officinalei"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.6,"score_history":{"1y":19.35,"6m":9.85,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302353,"mean":6.9982161057411,"rank":442143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7859638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302353,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298193,"mean":8.9662700407788,"rank":21606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":276555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298193,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1729,"mean":3.296212962963,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1729,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":2.7331547619048,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
