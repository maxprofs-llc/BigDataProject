Insulin and IGF-I share a common cellular signaling process; thus, insulin resistance may influence the IGF-I-muscle-bone relationship.\nWe sought to determine the effect of insulin resistance on the muscle-dependent relationship between IGF-I and bone mass in pre-menarcheal girls.\nThis was a cross-sectional study conducted at a university research center involving 147 girls ages 9 to 11 years.\nGlucose, insulin and IGF-I were measured from fasting blood samples. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated from glucose and insulin. Fat-free soft tissue (FFST) mass and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Our primary outcome was BMC\/height.\nIn our path model, IGF-I predicted FFST mass (b = 0.018; P = .001), which in turn, predicted BMC\/height (b = 0.960; P < .001). IGF-I predicted BMC\/height (b = 0.001; P = .002), but not after accounting for the mediator of this relationship, FFST mass. The HOMA-IR by IGF-I interaction negatively predicted FFST mass (b = -0.044; P = .034). HOMA-IR had a significant and negative effect on the muscle-dependent relationship between IGF-I and BMC\/height (b = -0.151; P = .047).\nLean body mass is an important intermediary factor in the IGF-I-bone relationship. For this reason, bone development may be compromised indirectly via suboptimal IGF-I-dependent muscle development in insulin resistant children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["JM Kindler"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2015-3451","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T20:53:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7197"],"journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1448523775,"links":["http:\/\/press.endocrine.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1210\/jc.2015-3451?utm_source=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26574958","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Insulin resistance negatively influences the muscle-dependent IGF-I-bone mass relationship in pre-menarcheal girls","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insulin-resistance-negatively-influences-muscle-dependent-igf1bone-mass-relationship-premenarcheal-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":3148269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1974307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250197,"mean":9.2459010615677,"rank":131167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":92379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250197,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5704,"mean":8.0260687357531,"rank":3461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5704,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":14.858141414141,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
