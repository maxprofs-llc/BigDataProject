Biodegradation of contaminated cork using filamentous fungi could be a good alternative for detoxifying cork to facilitate its final processing. For this purpose, the degradation efficiency of anthracene by three ligninolytic white-rot fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Irpex lacteus and Pleurotus ostreatus) and three non-ligninolytic fungi which are found in the cork itself (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum and Mucor racemosus) are compared. Anthracene degradation by all fungi was examined in solid-phase cultures after 0, 16, 30 and 61\u00a0days. The degradation products of anthracene by P. simplicissimum and I. lacteus were also identified by GC-MS and a metabolic pathway was proposed for P. simplicissimum. Results show that all the fungi tested degraded anthracene. After 61\u00a0days of incubation, approximately 86%, 40%, and 38% of the initial concentration of anthracene (i.e., 100\u00a0\u00b5M) was degraded by P. simplicissimum, P. chrysosporium and I. lacteus, respectively. The rest of the fungi degraded anthracene to a lesser extent (<30%). As a final remark, the results obtained in this study indicate that P. simplicissimum, a non-ligninolytic fungi characteristic of cork itself, could be used as an efficient degrader of PAH-contaminated cork.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f61000061c","authors":["Patr\u00edcia Jov\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1080\/10934529.2015.1079114","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T19:44:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-4117"],"journal":"Journal of Environmental Science & Health, Part A: Toxic\/Hazardous Substances & Environmental Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1448474922,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10934529.2015.1079114"],"pmid":"26540209","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Fungal biodegradation of anthracene-polluted cork: A comparative study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fungal-biodegradation-anthracenepolluted-cork-comparative-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":3145491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1972124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250048,"mean":9.2462525845141,"rank":131056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":92354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250048,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":2.1873488372093,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
