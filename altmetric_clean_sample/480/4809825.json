Emergent change approach with participation in the implementation process is thought to increase clinical autonomy. Planned change approach without this participation is thought not to increase clinical autonomy. Evidence of these effects on clinical autonomy is however limited.\nTo examine the changes in clinical autonomy and in personal norms and values for a planned change and emergent change implementation of an innovation, e.g. intensive insulin therapy.\nProspective comparative study with two geographically separated nurses' teams on one intensive care unit (ICU), randomly assigned to the experimental conditions.\nData were collected from March 2008 to January 2009. Pre-existing differences in perception of team and innovation characteristics were excluded using instruments based on the innovation contingency model. The Nursing Activity Scale was used to measure clinical autonomy. The Personal Values and Norms instrument was used to assess orientation towards nursing activities and the Team Learning Processes instrument to assess learning as a team.\nPre-implementation the measurements did not differ. Post-implementation, clinical autonomy was increased in the emergent change team and decreased in the planned change team. The Personal Values and Norms instrument showed in the emergent change team a decreased hierarchic score and increased developmental and rational scores. In the planned change team the hierarchical and group scores were increased. Learning as a team did not differ between the teams.\nIn both teams there was a change in clinical autonomy and orientation towards nursing activities, in line with the experimental conditions. Emergent change implementation resulted in more clinical autonomy than planned change implementation.\nIf an innovation requires the nurses to make their own clinical decisions, an emergent change implementation should help to establish this clinical autonomy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f61000320b","authors":["Luiking, Marie-Louise","Aarts, Leon","Bras, Leo","Grypdonck, Maria","van Linge, Roland"],"doi":"10.1111\/nicc.12135","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T09:32:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-5153"],"journal":"Nursing in Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1448530288,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26581545?dopt=abstract"],"pmid":"26581545","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","criticalcare"],"title":"Planned change or emergent change implementation approach and nurses' professional clinical autonomy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/planned-change-emergent-change-implementation-approach-nurses-professional-clinical-autonomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":4891480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250365,"mean":9.2463443226662,"rank":170294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250365,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":3.2768085106383,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.52,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBAZN\/statuses\/669810691767975936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4809825],"posted_on":"2015-11-26T09:31:28+00:00","author":{"name":"KIC St. Antonius","url":"https:\/\/stantonius-responsive.vakliteratuur.info\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1633339777\/_MG_2129_normal.jpg","description":"Kennis- & Informatiecentrum Academie St. Antonius Ziekenhuis, Nieuwegein en Utrecht.","id_on_source":"MBAZN","tweeter_id":"29987588","geo":{"lt":52.02917,"ln":5.08056,"country":"NL"},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"669810691767975936"}]}}
