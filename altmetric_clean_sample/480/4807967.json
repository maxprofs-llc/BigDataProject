We propose that mobile telestroke assessment during ambulance transport is feasible using low-cost, widely available technology.\nWe designed a platform including a tablet-based end point, high-speed modem with commercial wireless access, external antennae, and portable mounting apparatus. Mobile connectivity testing was performed along six primary ambulance routes in a rural network. Audiovisual (AV) quality was assessed simultaneously by both an in-vehicle and an in-hospital rater using a standardized 6-point rating scale (\u22654 indicating feasibility). We sought to achieve 9\u2009min of continuous AV connectivity presumed sufficient to perform mobile telestroke assessments.\nThirty test runs were completed: 93% achieved a minimum of 9\u2009min of continuous video transmission with a mean mobile connectivity time of 18\u2009min. Mean video and audio quality ratings were 4.51 (4.54 vehicle; 4.48 hospital) and 5.00 (5.13 in-vehicle; 4.87 hospital), respectively. Total initial cost of the system was $1,650 per ambulance.\nIn this small, single-centered study we maintained high-quality continuous video transmission along primary ambulance corridors using a low-cost mobile telemedicine platform. The system is designed to be portable and adaptable, with generalizability for rapid assessment of emergency conditions in which direct observational exam may improve prehospital diagnosis and treatment. Thus mobile telestroke assessment is feasible using low-cost components and commercial wireless connectivity. More research is needed to demonstrate clinical reliability and efficacy in a live-patient setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008aff","authors":["Lippman, Jason M","Chapman Smith, Sherita N","McMurry, Timothy L","Sutton, Zachary G","Gunnell, Brian S","Cote, Jack","Perina, Debra G","Cattell-Gordon, David C","Rheuban, Karen S","Solenski, Nina J","Worrall, Bradford B","Southerland, Andrew M"],"doi":"10.1089\/tmj.2015.0155","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T21:31:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1556-3669"],"journal":"Telemedicine Journal (now called Telemedicine Journal and e-Health)","last_mentioned_on":1448669585,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26600433?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer611b4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26600433?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26600433","pubdate":"2015-11-25T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["healthservices","medicalinformatics"],"title":"Mobile Telestroke During Ambulance Transport Is Feasible in a Rural EMS Setting: The iTREAT Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mobile-telestroke-during-ambulance-transport-feasible-rural-ems-setting-itreat-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6615543,"mean":6.1355830745238,"rank":4894315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":970789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6615543,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250343,"mean":9.2448133992698,"rank":170290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":52069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250343,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":4.965581769437,"rank":601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":6.3034782608696,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
