Variables collected included age, race, sex, preoperative weight percentiles, and weight percentiles at 3month, 12month, and 3year followup intervals.\n20 patients met inclusion criteria. 15 (75%) patients were male and 5 (25%) were female. 9 (45%) patients were African American, 8 (40%) were Caucasian, and 3 (15%) were other. Average weight for age at surgery was 29.8 percentile. 6 (30%) had failure to thrive by weight. By 3months postop average weight had increased by 7.67 percentile (p=0.09, 95% CI -1.62 to 17.0), by 12months there was an observed increase of 19.1 percentile (p=0.06, 95% CI 0.47-37.8), and by 3years the average weight had increased by 26.53 percentile (p=0.03, 95% CI 4.47-48.59). By three years postop the average weight had normalized (64.5 percentile). Among those who met preoperative failure to thrive criteria (average 0.11 percentile), weight gain was still dramatic with average weight percentile of 37.5 by 3years postop.\nPatients undergoing supraglottoplasty are typically underweight for age. Statistically significant weight gain occurs in children after going supraglottoplasty. This intervention can normalize their growth chart growth patterns by 3years postoperatively, even in children with failure to thrive.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Neiner, John","Gungor, Anil"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjoto.2015.11.003","first_seen_on":"2015-11-26T07:59:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0196-0709","1532-818X","01960709"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1457649670,"links":["http:\/\/www.amjoto.com\/article\/S0196-0709(15)00235-5\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26954867?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amjoto.com\/article\/S0196070915002355\/pdf","pmid":"26954867","pubdate":"2016-03-10T22:02:22+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Evaluation of Growth Curves in Children after Supraglottoplasty","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-growth-curves-children-after-supraglottoplasty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377337,"mean":6.4097701099652,"rank":3786155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2067569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377337,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285618,"mean":8.828180605496,"rank":146066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":108412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285618,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":1.8942053789731,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.5958333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/708060152012738560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4809558],"posted_on":"2016-03-10T22:41:10+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":389},"tweet_id":"708060152012738560"}]}}
