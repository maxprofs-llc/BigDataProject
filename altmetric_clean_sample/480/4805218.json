Here, we address this challenge through the use of metal-ion redox couples as energy carriers for battery operation. Carbon, with a suitable degree of crystallinity and surface oxygenation, was used as an effective anode material for the metal redox reactions. A Sn0.9In0.1P2O7-based electrolyte membrane allowed no crossover of vanadium ions through the membrane. The V(4+)\/V(3+), V(3+)\/V(2+), and Sn(4+)\/Sn(2+) redox reactions took place at a more positive potential than that for hydrogen reduction, so that undesired hydrogen production could be avoided. The resulting electrical capacity reached 306 and 258\u2005mAh\u2009g(-1) for VOSO4 and SnSO4, respectively, and remained at 76 and 91\u2009% of their respective initial values after 50 cycles.","altmetric_jid":"53222dc82a83ee27268b4577","authors":["Nagao, Masahiro","Kobayashi, Kazuyo","Yamamoto, Yuta","Yamaguchi, Togo","Oogushi, Akihide","Hibino, Takashi"],"doi":"10.1002\/celc.201500473","endpage":"255","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T10:49:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2196-0216"],"issue":"2","journal":"ChemElectroChem","last_mentioned_on":1457977237,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/celc.201500473","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/celc.201500473\/full","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/celc.201500473\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/celc.201500473\/pdf","pmid":"27525212","pubdate":"2015-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","startpage":"247","title":"Rechargeable Metal\u2013Air Proton\u2010Exchange Membrane Batteries for Renewable Energy Storage","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rechargeable-metalair-protonexchange-membrane-batteries-renewable-energy-storage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7867437,"mean":6.6630545816902,"rank":3342886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4412413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7867437,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291912,"mean":8.8570520466853,"rank":106881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":179498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291912,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1008,"mean":1.6868520357498,"rank":114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1008,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":5.5235294117647,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
