Here we report that TRIM33 deficiency results in high, sustained expression of Ifnb1 at late stages of toll-like receptor-mediated activation in macrophages but not in fibroblasts. In macrophages, TRIM33 is recruited by PU.1 to a conserved region, the Ifnb1 Control Element (ICE), located 15\u2009kb upstream of the Ifnb1 transcription start site. ICE constitutively interacts with Ifnb1 through a TRIM33-independent chromatin loop. At late phases of lipopolysaccharide activation of macrophages, TRIM33 is bound to ICE, regulates Ifnb1 enhanceosome loading, controls Ifnb1 chromatin structure and represses Ifnb1 gene transcription by preventing recruitment of CBP\/p300. These results characterize a previously unknown mechanism of macrophage-specific regulation of Ifnb1 transcription whereby TRIM33 is critical for Ifnb1 gene transcription shutdown.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Ferri, Federica","Parcelier, Aude","Petit, Vanessa","Gallouet, Anne-Sophie","Lewandowski, Daniel","Dalloz, Marion","van den Heuvel, Anita","Kolovos, Petros","Soler, Eric","Squadrito, Mario Leonardo","De Palma, Michele","Davidson, Irwin","Rousselet, Germain","Romeo, Paul-Henri"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms9900","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T21:10:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1448485839,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26592194?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26592194","pubdate":"2015-11-25T22:03:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"TRIM33 switches off Ifnb1 gene transcription during the late phase of macrophage activation.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trim33-switches-ifnb1-gene-transcription-during-late-phase-macrophage-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":5636671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250047,"mean":9.2462785647441,"rank":197959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250047,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10132,"mean":38.670329681177,"rank":9686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10132,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":49.856574102964,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
