With obesity rates on the rise across the country, as well as around the world, it is important that the possible effects of obesity in the workplace be fully understood, especially those effects linked to lost-time injuries. The aim of this paper was to evaluate predictors of workplace lost-time injuries and how they may be related to obesity or high body mass index by examining factors associated with lost-time injuries in the health care sector, a well-studied industry with the highest number of reported time loss injuries in Canada. A literature review focusing on lost-time injuries in Registered Nurses (RNs) was conducted using the keywords and terms: lost time injury, workers' compensation, occupational injury, workplace injury, injury, injuries, work, workplace, occupational, nurse, registered nurse, RN, health care, predictors, risk factors, risk, risks, cause, causes, obese, obesity, and body mass index. Data on predictors or factors associated with lost-time injuries in RNs were gathered and organized using Loisel's Work Disability Prevention Management Model and extrapolated upon using existing literature surrounding obesity in the Canadian workplace.","altmetric_jid":"537f30872a83eeb45a8b4670","authors":["Jordan, Gillian","Nowrouzi-Kia, Behnam","Gohar, Basem","Nowrouzi, Behdin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.shaw.2014.12.006","first_seen_on":"2015-11-25T13:56:04+00:00","issns":["2093-7911"],"issue":"1","journal":"Safety and Health at Work","last_mentioned_on":1448459741,"links":["http:\/\/www.e-shaw.net\/article\/S2093-7911(15)00006-2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.e-shaw.net\/article\/S2093791115000062\/pdf","pmid":"25830063","pubdate":"2015-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Obesity as a Possible Risk Factor for Lost-time Injury in Registered Nurses: A Literature Review","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/obesity-possible-risk-factor-losttime-injury-registered-nurses-literature-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6606474,"mean":6.1300731649094,"rank":3145479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1972133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6606474,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250048,"mean":9.2462419865065,"rank":131056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":92355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250048,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":3.9341515151515,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
