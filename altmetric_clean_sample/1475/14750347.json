Recent progress in the detection of photoelectrons has enabled the acquisition of spectra at pressures up to a few tens of millibars. Although reducing the pressure gap represents a remarkable advantage for catalysis, active sites may be short-lived or hidden in the majority of spectator species. Time-resolved experiments, conducted under transient conditions, are a suitable strategy for discriminating between active sites and spectators. In the present work, we characterized the surface of a Pt\/CeO2 powder catalyst at 1.0 mbar of a reacting mixture of carbon monoxide and oxygen and, by means of time resolution, identified short-lived active species. We replaced oxygen with nitrogen in the reaction mixture while fast-detecting the core level peaks of cerium. The results indicate that active Ce(3+) sites form transiently at the surface when the oxygen is switched off. Analysis of the depth profile shows that Ce(3+) ions are located at the ceria surface. The same experiment, performed on platinum-free ceria, reveals negligible reduction, indicating that platinum boosts the formation of Ce(3+) active sites at the interface.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Luca Artiglia"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b02314","endpage":"108","first_seen_on":"2016-12-14T20:15:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-7185"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1481746516,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpclett.6b02314"],"pmid":"27936758","pubdate":"2016-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"102","title":"\n              Introducing Time Resolution to Detect Ce\n              3+\n              Catalytically Active Sites at the Pt\/CeO\n              2\n              Interface through Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy\n            ","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/introducing-time-resolution-detect-ce3-catalytically-active-sites-ptceo2-interface-through-ambient-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":6828319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251632,"mean":12.356615273952,"rank":205123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251632,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2241,"mean":3.3716892857143,"rank":1418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":214,"mean":2.3232863849765,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":214,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/809129653176827905","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14750347],"posted_on":"2016-12-14T20:15:16+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16476},"tweet_id":"809129653176827905"}]}}
