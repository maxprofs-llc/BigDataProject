This manmade #pollution in nearly all parts of the ecosystem.","Parabens -found in multiple #shark species-and throughout the marine system."],"citation":{"abstract":"Despite the widespread use of parabens in a range of consumer products, little is known about bioaccumulation of these chemicals in aquatic environments. In this study, six parabens and four of their common metabolites were measured in abiotic and biotic samples collected from a subtropical marine food web in coastal Florida. Methyl paraben (MeP) was found in all abiotic (100%) and a majority of biotic (87%) samples. 4-Hydroxy benzoic acid (4-HB) was the most abundant metabolite, found in 99% of biotic and all abiotic samples analyzed. The food chain accumulation of MeP and 4-HB was investigated for this food web. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) of MeP was estimated to be 1.83, which suggests considerable biomagnification of this compound in the marine food web. In contrast, a low TMF value was found for 4-HB (0.30), indicating that this compound is metabolized and excreted along the food web. This is the first study to document the widespread occurrence of parabens and their metabolites in fish, invertebrates, seagrasses, marine macroalgae, mangroves, sea water, and ocean sediments and to elucidate biomagnification potential of MeP and 4-HB in a marine food web.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Xiaohong Xue","Jingchuan Xue","Wenbin Liu","Douglas H.
