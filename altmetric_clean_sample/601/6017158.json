Using scanning force microscopy, we show here that the damage recognition complex consists of two UvrA and two UvrB subunits, with the DNA wrapped around one of the UvrB monomers. Upon binding the damage and release of the UvrA subunits, UvrB remains a dimer in the preincision complex. After association with the UvrC protein, one of the UvrB monomers is released. We propose a model in which the presence of two UvrB subunits ensures damage recognition in both DNA strands. Upon binding of the UvrA(2)B(2) complex to a putative damaged site, the DNA wraps around one of the UvrB monomers, which will subsequently probe one of the DNA strands for the presence of a lesion. When no damage is found, the DNA will wrap around the second UvrB subunit, which will check the other strand for aberrations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Verhoeven, Esther E A","Wyman, Claire","Moolenaar, Geri F","Goosen, Nora","Esther E.A.
