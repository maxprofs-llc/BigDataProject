Exclusion criteria were no meniscal tear or incomplete tear less than 10\u00a0mm in length, delay to surgery from initial injury more than 1\u00a0year, delay to surgery from preoperative MRI more than 4\u00a0weeks, revisions, fracture histories, and multiple ligament injuries. According to preoperative MRI diagnosis, the meniscal tears were sorted into true-positive MRI and false-negative MRI groups. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze risk factors including age, gender, body mass index, time from injury to MRI, knee instability, concomitant ligament injury,\u00a0intra-articular effusion, bone contusion, cartilage injury, meniscal tear location, and meniscal tear pattern.\nEnrolled 249 meniscal tears (159 medial and 90 lateral menisci) were sorted into true-positive MRI (n\u00a0= 136) and false-negative MRI (n\u00a0= 113) groups. As time from injury to MRI diagnosis increased, the risk of the false-negative MRI diagnosis decreased (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.859; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.802-0.921). Meniscal tear location within the posterior one-third was a significant risk factor compared with tear within the anterior one-third (adjusted OR, 11.823; 95% CI, 2.272-61.519). Peripheral longitudinal tear pattern was also a significant risk factor (adjusted OR, 3.522; 95% CI, 1.256-9.878).\nSignificant risk factors for false-negative MRI included short time from injury to MRI diagnosis, meniscal tear location within the posterior one-third, and peripheral longitudinal tear pattern.\nLevel III, retrospective comparative study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b2c","authors":["Ji Hyun Ahn","Seung Hyo Jeong","Ho Won
