Behavioural intervention consisted of a 45-minute consultation, where verbal and written information describing sleep physiology and strategies to improve infant sleep was provided. Mothers were followed up 2-6 weeks later. Mothers rated their confidence (C), pleasure (P) and frustration (F) on a scale from 0 to 10, and completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 at each consultation. The number of night-time awakenings and the time taken to see an improvement in infant sleep were also reported.\nThere was a significant increase in the C and P scores, and a significant decrease in the F scores (all p < 0.001). The mean total CPF score increased significantly from 14 to 25 (maximum score = 30). There was also a significant decrease in depression, anxiety and stress of the mothers (all p < 0.001). The mean number of maximum night awakenings also decreased significantly, from 5 to 0.5 (p < 0.001). The mean time taken to see improved infant sleep, as reported by the mothers, was 2.8 nights.\nA single consultation using a behavioural strategy to improve infant sleep was effective in improving infant sleep and in increasing maternal emotional well-being. In particular, the scores for 'pleasure in being a mother' increased dramatically.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008939","authors":["Symon, Brian","Crichton, Georgina E","B Symon","GE Crichton"],"doi":"10.11622\/smedj.2016046","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T13:46:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0037-5675","00375675"],"journal":"Singapore Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1498583705,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26915392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26915392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26915392?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26915392","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:01:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The joy of parenting: infant sleep intervention to improve maternal emotional well-being and infant sleep.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/joy-parenting-infant-sleep-intervention-improve-maternal-emotional-wellbeing-infant-sleep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":3884328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4461451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289791,"mean":10.8946,"rank":126047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":158707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289791,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":2.9045185185185,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.05,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
