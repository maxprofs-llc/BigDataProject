A sociodemographic data form created by us to investigate alcohol-substance abuse, suicide attempt, previous history of trauma, self and family history of psychiatric disorders and Beck Anxiety Inventory was given to the patients.\nOf the patients exposed to violence 63% (n=46) were female and 27% (n=27) were male. Of these patients, 68.5% (n=50) were married, 43.8% (n=25) were workers, 34.2% were housewives, 11% were unemployed, and 11% were civil servants. Of the violence-exposed patients, 56.2% (n=41) were primary school, 21.9% (n=16) were high school, and 21.9% (n=16) were university graduates. Smoking and alcohol use rates were 54.8% (n=40) and 17.8% (n=13), respectively. The most common trauma type was assault using physical force with a ratio of 78.1% (n=57). In addition, anxiety scores were high in 42.5% (n=31) and moderate in 9.6% (n=7) of the patients. Mentioned psychiatric disorder was present in 17.8% (n=13) of the patients and 19.2% (n=14) of the patients' relatives. The correlation between sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety scores revealed that married patients had higher anxiety scores (P<0.01) and patients assaulted by their parents had lower anxiety scores (P<0.00).\nA total of 63% of the violence-exposed patients admitted to emergency room were females, 56.2% were primary school graduates, and 43.8% were factory workers; this result shows that low socioeconomical status and education level affect exposure to trauma especially in females. In addition, ~20% of the patients and patients' relatives had a psychiatric disorder and 53.4% of perpetrators were parents, spouses, and children; this result shows that psychiatric history and family relations are one of the issues that should be taken into account and treated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Filiz Izci","hilal hocagil","Abdullah Cuneyt Hocagil","Merve Iris Koc","Ebru F\u0131n\u0131kl\u0131","Sevda Korkmaz"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s91411","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T02:18:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2021","1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1456724854,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/association-between-sociodemographic-characteristics-and-anxiety-level-peer-reviewed-article-NDT"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29169","pmid":"27013877","pubdate":"2016-02-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"511","title":"Association between sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety levels of violence-exposed patients admitted to emergency clinic","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-sociodemographic-characteristics-anxiety-levels-violenceexposed-patients-admitte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7313486,"mean":6.3735475029997,"rank":5267384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1789383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7313486,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282523,"mean":10.639504789007,"rank":182327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":84198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282523,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1397,"mean":4.8529126074499,"rank":1096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1397,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.8581917808219,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
