In the first finished IUI episode, a positive relationship was found for \u22644% of morphologically normal spermatozoa (OR 1.39) and a moderate NIPMS (5-10 million; OR 1.73). Low NIPMS showed a negative relation (\u22641 million; OR 0.42). The TPMSC had no predictive value. The multivariable model (i.e., sperm morphology, NIPMS, female age, male age, and the number of cycles in the episode) had a moderate discriminatory accuracy (area under the curve 0.73).\nIntrauterine insemination is especially be relevant for couples with moderate male factor infertility (sperm morphology \u22644%, NIPMS 5-10 million). In the multivariable model, however, the predictive power of these sperm parameters is rather low.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Louise Lemmens","Snjezana Kos","Cornelis Beijer","Jacoline W.
