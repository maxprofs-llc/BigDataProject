We hypothesized that susceptibility to pulmonary hypertension, due to an augmented expression and activity of the RhoA\/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway in these neonates, can be reduced by daily administration of fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor. We studied 10 highland newborn lambs with conception, gestation and birth at 3,600m in Putre, Chile. Five highland controls (HLC) were compared to 5 highland lambs treated with fasudil (HL-FAS; 3 mg kg(-1) day(-1), intravenously administered for 10 days). Ten lowland controls were studied in Lluta (50m; LLC). During the 10 days of fasudil's daily administration, the drug decreased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and resistance (PVR), basally and during a superimposed episode of acute hypoxia. HL-FAS small pulmonary arteries showed diminished muscular area and a reduced contractile response to the thromboxane analog U46619, compared to HLC. Hypoxia, but no fasudil, changed the protein expression pattern of the RhoA\/ROCKII pathway. Moreover, HL-FAS lungs expressed less pMYPT1(T850) and pMYPT1T(696) than HLC, with a potential increase of the myosin light chain phosphatase activity. Finally, hypoxia induced RhoA, ROCKII and PKG mRNA expression in PASMCs of HLC, but fasudil reduced them (HL-FAS) similarly to LLC. We conclude that fasudil decreases the function of the RhoA\/ROCK pathway, reducing the PAP and PVR in chronically hypoxic highland neonatal lambs. The inhibition of ROCKs by fasudil may offer a possible therapeutic tool for the pulmonary hypertension of the neonates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002212","authors":["Lopez, Nandy C","Ebensperger, German","Herrera, Emilio A","Reyes, Roberto V","Calaf, Gloria","Cabello, Gertrudis","Moraga, Fernando A","Benaldo, Felipe A","Diaz, Marcela","Parer, Julian T","Llanos, Anibal J"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpregu.00177.2015","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T19:08:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1490"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Regulatory, Integrative & Comparative Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1456514887,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26911462?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26911462","pubdate":"2016-02-26T22:01:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"ROLE OF THE RHOA\/ROCK PATHWAY IN HIGH-ALTITUDE ASSOCIATED NEONATAL PULMONARY HYPERTENSION IN LAMBS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-rhoarock-pathway-highaltitude-associated-neonatal-pulmonary-hypertension-lambs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":5245524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1787389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484827936125,"rank":182014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":84401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1173,"mean":5.9066774744027,"rank":788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1173,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":5.2157142857143,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/statuses\/703281148823076864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6010159],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T18:11:06+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":443},"tweet_id":"703281148823076864"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/703300528030134272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6010159],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T19:28:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"703300528030134272"}]}}
