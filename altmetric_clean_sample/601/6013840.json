In this study, we explored miRNA as therapeutic targets in tumor stroma and found miR-199a-3p and miR-214-3p induced in patient-derived pancreatic CAFs and TGF-\u03b2-activated human PSCs (hPSCs). Inhibition of miR-199a\/-214 using hairpin inhibitors significantly inhibited TGF\u03b2-induced differentiation markers (e.g. \u03b1-SMA, collagen, PDGF\u03b2R), migration and proliferation. Furthermore, heterospheroids of Panc-1 and hPSCs attained smaller size with hPSCs transfected with anti-miR-199a\/-214 compared to control anti-miR. The conditioned medium obtained from TGF\u03b2-activated hPSCs induced tumor cell growth and endothelial cell tube formation. Interestingly, these inductions were abrogated in hPSCs transfected with anti-miR-199a or miR-214. Moreover, IPA analyses revealed signaling pathways related to miR-199a (TP53, mTOR, Smad1) and miR-214 (PTEN, Bax, ING4). Taken together, this study reveals miR-199a-3p and miR-214-3p as major regulators of PSC activation and PSC-induced pro-tumoral effects, representing them as key therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Kuninty, Praneeth R","Bojmar, Linda","Tjomsland, Vegard","Larsson, Marie","Storm, Gert","\u00d6stman, Arne","Sandstr\u00f6m, Per","Prakash, Jai"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.7651","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T15:06:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"13","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1456585568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26918939?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4941323","pmid":"26918939","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:00:25+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MicroRNA-199a and -214 as potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic stellate cells in pancreatic tumor","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna199a-214-potential-therapeutic-targets-pancreatic-stellate-cells-pancreatic-tumor-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":5508086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282648,"mean":10.516176439162,"rank":198359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282648,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602,"mean":2.7759609150129,"rank":3264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":554,"mean":1.5654285714286,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":554,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
