Here, we hypothesize that intensity of coping strategies, including denial, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), varies with type of renal replacement therapy (RRT). MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 60 in-center hemodialyzed patients (HD) and 55 patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We administered the Coping Inventory with Stressful Situation, Profile of Mood States, and Stroop Anxiety Inventory to measure patient coping strategies in the context of their ESRD. Denial defense mechanism was measured via the IBS-R\/ED. The Nottingham Health Profile was used to evaluate self-perceived quality of life. Serum potassium, urea, creatinine, phosphorus, calcium, albumin, and hematocrit were utilized as the measurements of adequacy of dialysis. RESULTS HD patients had higher self-reported intensity of denial mechanism and avoidance-oriented strategies versus CAPD patients. Because a single strategy is almost never employed, we conducted cluster analysis. We identify 3 patterns of coping strategies using cluster analysis. \"Repressors\" employed denial and avoidance strategies and were predominant in HD. The second cluster consists of subjects employing predominantly task-oriented strategies with equal distribution among dialyzed patients. The third cluster encompassed a small group of patients who shared higher intensity of both denial and task-oriented strategies. Health-related outcome, anxiety, and mood profile were similar across all patients. CONCLUSIONS HD patients predominantly used \"repressive\" strategies. Patients on RRT utilized denial and avoidance-based strategies to achieve satisfactory outcome in terms of perceived quality of life. We conclude that these coping mechanisms that were previously thought to be inferior are beneficial to patient compliance with RRT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd13","authors":["Nowak, Zbigniew","Wa\u0144kowicz, Zofia","Laudanski, Krzysztof","Zbigniew Nowak","Zofia Wa\u0144kowicz","Krzysztof Laudanski"],"doi":"10.12659\/msm.893331","endpage":"1805","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T14:39:24+00:00","issns":["1643-3750"],"journal":"Medical science monitor international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","last_mentioned_on":1469514319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26094792?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.12659\/MSM.893331"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.medscimonit.com\/download\/index\/idArt\/893331","pmid":"26094792","pubdate":"2015-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Scientific Information, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1798","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Denial Defense Mechanism in Dialyzed Patients","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/denial-defense-mechanism-dialyzed-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":4080031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3846915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287898,"mean":10.821899769709,"rank":144875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":132139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287898,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1015,"mean":2.7576252465483,"rank":318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1015,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":1.5991525423729,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":5,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Psychology":3,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InNephrology\/statuses\/703587239004147713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6013753],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T14:27:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Nephrology India","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/InNephrology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1992499647\/InTwitter_icon_normal.png","description":"The Latest In Nephrology","id_on_source":"InNephrology","tweeter_id":"445512677","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":438},"tweet_id":"703587239004147713"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Denial Defense Mechanism in Dialyzed Patients.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=978042455564785&id=294178913951146","license":"public","citation_ids":[6013753],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T14:27:24+00:00","summary":"Denial Defense Mechanism in Dialyzed Patients.","author":{"name":"India Nephrology 2.0","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/294178913951146","facebook_wall_name":"India Nephrology 2.0","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/294178913951146\/picture","id_on_source":"294178913951146"}},{"title":"Denial Defense Mechanism in Dialyzed Patients. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153948700258897&id=126656923896","license":"public","citation_ids":[6013753,6013753],"posted_on":"2016-07-24T11:54:51+00:00","summary":"Sometimes it's better to not face reality.  http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26094792","author":{"name":"Holistic Kidney","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/126656923896","facebook_wall_name":"Holistic Kidney","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/126656923896\/picture","id_on_source":"126656923896"}},{"title":"Holistic Kidney","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=271171456588248&id=180107385694656","license":"public","citation_ids":[6013753],"posted_on":"2016-07-26T06:25:19+00:00","summary":"Mecanismo de negaci\u00f3n de Defensa en pacientes que se dializan","author":{"name":"Casa del Ri\u00f1\u00f3n","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/180107385694656","facebook_wall_name":"Casa del Ri\u00f1\u00f3n","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/180107385694656\/picture","id_on_source":"180107385694656"}}]}}
