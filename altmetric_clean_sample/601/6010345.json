Correlation analysis between significantly expressed proteins and clinical characteristics\u00a0(differentiation, clinical stage, and node metastasis)\u00a0was performed. The expression of I\u03baB\u00a0kinase-\u03b2\u00a0(IKK-\u03b2)\u00a0in Hep-2 cells transfected with IKK-\u03b2-siRNA or pcDNA3.1-IKK-\u03b2 was detected both by\u00a0real-time polymerase chain reaction\u00a0and western blot. Besides, a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT), flow cytometer, and\u00a0transwell assay\u00a0were used to examine the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration rate of Hep-2 cells, respectively.\nThree differentially expressed proteins were identified. Among them, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1\u00a0(TNFR1)\u00a0and IKK-\u03b2\u00a0were significantly up-regulated (p\u00a0< 0.01) and Fas-associated via death domain\u00a0(FADD)\u00a0was significantly down-regulated (p\u00a0< 0.01). The correlation analysis showed that IKK-\u03b2\u00a0expression\u00a0had a significant association with differentiation, clinical stage, and node metastasis (p\u00a0< 0.05). Besides, high expressed\u00a0IKK-\u03b2\u00a0resulted in significantly\u00a0increased proliferation and migration rate (p\u00a0< 0.05). Reversely, Hep-2 cells transfected with IKK-\u03b2-siRNA showed significantly lower proliferation and migration rate (p\u00a0< 0.05) and\u00a0significantly higher apoptosis\u00a0rate (p\u00a0< 0.05) than normal cells.\n\u00a0The NF\u03baB signaling pathway involved TNFR1,\u00a0IKK-\u03b2, and FADD is significantly associated with the development of LSCC. Over-expressed\u00a0IKK-\u03b2\u00a0efficiently inhibits cell apoptosis and has positive effects on cell proliferation and migration.","authors":["Li, X-T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T19:40:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2284-0729"],"issue":"3","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","last_mentioned_on":1456512248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26914121?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26914121","pubdate":"2016-02-26T22:00:29+00:00","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma progression is associated with the NF\u03baB signaling pathway regulated by I\u03baB kinase \u03b2.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laryngeal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-progression-associated-nfkappab-signaling-pathway-regulated-ikappa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/703289460520148992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6010345],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T18:44:08+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"703289460520148992"}]}}
