This bacterium is able to degrade various polysaccharides, especially agar and alginate. The major cellular fatty acids (>10 % of the total fatty acids) were C15:0, iso-C15:0, C15:03-OH and iso-C15:1. The major menaquinone was MK-6. The DNA G+C content was 35.3 mol %. The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine and two unknown polar lipids. Strain Gy8T shows the high sequence similarity to Seonamhaeicola aphaedonensis AH-M5T (95.6 %), and they form a distinct branch in phylogenetic trees with neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony algorithms. Besides, the novel strain and the reference strain, the only recognized strain in the genus Seonamhaeicola, contain MK-6 as the major menaquinone, iso-C15:0 and iso-C15:1 as the major fatty acids, and phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown lipid as the major polar lipids. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain Gy8T represents the type strain of a novel species within the genus Seonamhaeicola in the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum Bacteroidetes, for which the name Seonamhaeicola algicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Gy8T (=KCTC 42396T=CICC 23816T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Zhou, Yan-Xia","Du, Zong-Jun","Chen, Guan-Jun"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.000991","first_seen_on":"2016-02-28T17:20:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1456679948,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26920588?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26920588","pubdate":"2016-02-28T22:00:39+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Seonamhaeicola algicola sp. nov., a novel complex polysaccharide-degrading bacterium isolated from Gracilaria blodgettii, and emended description o..","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seonamhaeicola-algicola-sp-nov-complexpolysaccharidedegrading-bacterium-isolated-gracilaria-blodgett"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7306657,"mean":6.3706585551552,"rank":5518199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7306657,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282711,"mean":10.572327409713,"rank":198455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282711,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3357,"mean":2.640774135876,"rank":2569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3357,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":1.0547244094488,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/703992843170238464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6016618],"posted_on":"2016-02-28T17:19:08+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
