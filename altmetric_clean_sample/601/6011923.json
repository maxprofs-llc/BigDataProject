In the present study, effects of Inos on the production of cytokines attributable to Th1 (IL-2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) or Th2 cells (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) were tested in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Inos enhanced TNF-a secretion significantly (in short-term - 24-hour, and prolonged term - 72-hour cultures) and IFN-g (in 72-hour cultures). Surprisingly, production of IL-10 by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was suppressed by Inos in a dose-dependent manner in both 24-hour and 72-hour cultures. These results shed some light on immunomodulatory properties of Inos and suggest applicability of this agent in patients with a depressed function of the immune system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8143cf058f61000bb5f","authors":["Lasek, Witold","Janyst, Micha\u0142","Wolny, Rafa\u0142","Zapa\u0142a, \u0141ukasz","Bocian, Katarzyna","Drela, Nadzieja"],"doi":"10.1515\/acph-2015-0015","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T02:14:08+00:00","issns":["1846-9558"],"issue":"2","journal":"Acta Pharmaceutica","last_mentioned_on":1456539186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26011933?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26011933","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Immunomodulatory effects of inosine pranobex on cytokine production by human lymphocytes","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunomodulatory-effects-inosine-pranobex-cytokine-production-human-lymphocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":5508027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282650,"mean":10.515906378582,"rank":198328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282650,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.0896551724138,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
