Even so, the mechanistic reasoning that has received attention has almost exclusively been positive-both in an epistemic sense of claiming that there is a mechanistic chain and in a health-related sense of there being claimed benefits for the patient. Negative mechanistic reasoning has been neglected, both in the epistemic and in the health-related sense. I distinguish three main types of negative mechanistic reasoning and subsume them under a new definition of mechanistic reasoning in the context of assessing medical interventions. This definition is wider than a previous suggestion in the literature. Each negative type corresponds to a range of evidential strengths, and it is argued that there are differences with respect to typical evidential strengths. The variety of negative mechanistic reasoning should be acknowledged in EBM, and it presents a serious challenge to proponents of so-called medical hierarchies of evidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b4a","authors":["Jesper Jerkert"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11017-015-9348-2","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T22:25:33+00:00","issns":["1573-0980","1573-1200"],"journal":"Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1456520787,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11017-015-9348-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11017-015-9348-2.pdf","pmid":"26597869","pubdate":"2015-11-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ethics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"General Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"History of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Philosophy of Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theory of Medicine\/Bioethics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Negative mechanistic reasoning in medical intervention assessment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/negative-mechanistic-reasoning-medical-intervention-assessment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":3715314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2055093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282432,"mean":10.484785147522,"rank":152250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282432,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145,"mean":3.9803194444444,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":7.4571428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
