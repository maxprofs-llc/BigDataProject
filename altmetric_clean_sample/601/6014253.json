Here we report that multiple mechanisms that promote OvCa progression and chemo-resistance could be inhibited by ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16. Significant correlations between low expression of miR-16, high expression of BMI1 and shortened overall survival (OS) were noted in high grade serous (HGS) OvCa patients upon analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Targeting BMI1, in vitro with either microRNA reduced clonal growth of OvCa cells. Additionally, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as expression of the cisplatin transporter ATP7B were inhibited by miR-15a and miR-16 resulting in decreased degradation of the extra-cellular matrix and enhanced sensitization of OvCa cells to cisplatin. Nanoliposomal delivery of the miR-15a and miR-16 combination, in a pre-clinical chemo-resistant orthotopic mouse model of OvCa, demonstrated striking reduction in tumor burden compared to cisplatin alone. Thus, with the advent of miR replacement therapy some of which are in Phase 2 clinical trials, miR-15a and miR-16 represent novel ammunition in the anti-OvCa arsenal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Dwivedi, Shailendra Kumar Dhar","Mustafi, Soumyajit Banerjee","Mangala, Lingegowda S","Jiang, Dahai","Pradeep, Sunila","Rodriguez-Aguayo, Cristian","Ling, Hui","Ivan, Cristina","Mukherjee, Priyabrata","Calin, George A","Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel","Sood, Anil K","Bhattacharya, Resham"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.7618","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T16:41:54+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"12","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1456591295,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26918603?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4924772","pmid":"26918603","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:00:34+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Therapeutic evaluation of microRNA-15a and microRNA-16 in ovarian cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/7618","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-evaluation-microrna15a-microrna16-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":5508090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282648,"mean":10.516196782559,"rank":198361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282648,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6602,"mean":2.7759609150129,"rank":3264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6602,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":554,"mean":1.5690452079566,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":554,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
