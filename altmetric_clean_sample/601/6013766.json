Assessments were made pre-injection, on D14, Month (M)02, M03 and M05 using the Merz Aesthetics Hand Grading Scale (MAS) and Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). Participants completed questionnaires on satisfaction, pain and adverse events (AEs).\nData distribution was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests. The Wilcoxon signed-rank and Chi-square tests were employed to evaluate quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.\nAll 10 participants completed the study, four opted for a M03 touch-up (0.8 mL Radiesse(\u00ae)). Evaluator-assessed mean GAIS scores were between 2 (significant improvement but not complete correction) and 3 (optimal cosmetic result) at each time point. The MAS score improved from D01 to M05 (N: 2.60 to 1.40; C: 2.20 to 1.30). Following treatment, participants reported skin was softer, more elastic, more youthful and less wrinkled. Other than less noticeable veins and tendons on the C hand, no differences in participant satisfaction were noted. All AEs were mild, with no serious AEs reported.\nBoth injection techniques (needle and cannula) demonstrated equivalent clinical efficacy with a comparable safety profile for the correction of age-related changes in hands with Radiesse(\u00ae).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fb4","authors":["Gubanova, Elena I","Starovatova, Polina A"],"doi":"10.4103\/0974-2077.167271","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T14:42:29+00:00","issns":["0974-2077"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cutaneous & Aesthetic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1456583588,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26644738"],"pmcid":"PMC4645144","pmid":"26644738","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"A Prospective, Comparative, Evaluator-blind Clinical Study Investigating Efficacy and Safety of Two Injection Techniques with Radiesse(\u00ae) for the C..","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-comparative-evaluatorblind-clinical-study-investigating-efficacy-safety-two-injection-te-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":3721192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2055317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282650,"mean":10.51610061242,"rank":152592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282650,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":5.1607746478873,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":7.1571428571429,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BAAFS_Academy\/statuses\/703588680749948929","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6013766],"posted_on":"2016-02-27T14:33:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Baafs Academy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/550045182981206016\/f313V9NX_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BAAFS_Academy","tweeter_id":"2951902221","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":58},"tweet_id":"703588680749948929"}]}}
