The deficiency of developmental transcriptomic data is becoming the bottleneck of further researches on the mechanisms underlying settlement and metamorphosis in early development. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing was performed for S. constricta at different early developmental stages by using Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired-end (PE) sequencing technology. A total of 112,209,077 PE clean reads were generated. De novo assembly generated 249,795 contigs with an average length of 585\u00a0bp. Gene annotation resulted in the identification of 22,870 unigene hits against the NCBI database. Eight unique sequences related to metamorphosis were identified and analyzed using real-time PCR. The razor clam reference transcriptome would provide useful information on early developmental and metamorphosis mechanisms and could be used in the genetic breeding of shellfish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080c7","authors":["Niu, Donghong","Wang, Fei","Xie, Shumei","Sun, Fanyue","Wang, Ze","Peng, Maoxiao","Li, Jiale"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10126-016-9691-y","first_seen_on":"2016-02-28T13:02:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1436-2236"],"journal":"Marine Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1456664423,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26921240"],"pmid":"26921240","pubdate":"2016-02-28T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Freshwater & Marine Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biotechnology"],"title":"Developmental Transcriptome Analysis and Identification of Genes Involved in Larval Metamorphosis of the Razor Clam, Sinonovacula constricta.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/developmental-transcriptome-analysis-identification-genes-involved-larval-metamorphosis-razor-clam-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7306657,"mean":6.3706585551552,"rank":6312930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7306657,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282711,"mean":10.57229575183,"rank":238235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282711,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":2.0838333333333,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.6875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
