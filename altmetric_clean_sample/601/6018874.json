In the present study, we investigated NOVA1 expression in various subtypes of mature and immature T- and natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas as well as in various B-cell lymphoma subtypes.\nNOVA1 immunoexpression was evaluated in hyperplastic palatine tonsils (n=20), T- and NK-cell lymphomas (n=177), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=151), and other types of B cell lymphomas (n=31). Nuclear staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells were graded. NOVA1 mRNA expression was analyzed in various lymphoma cell lines.\nTumor cells of T- and NK-cell lymphomas showed higher expression levels of NOVA1 than did normal paracortical T cells, and 56.5% of T- and NK-cell lymphoma cases showed diffuse and strong expression. The NOVA1 expression level varied according to the subtype; it was higher in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and T lymphoblastic leukemia\/lymphoma (T-LBL), but it was lower in ALK-positive ALCL. In almost all B-cell lymphomas, NOVA1 expression was very low or negative. NOVA1 mRNA was also expressed in Jurkat, a T-LBL cell line.\nThe present findings suggest that NOVA1 upregulation may be involved in certain subtypes of T- and NK-cell lymphomas, but not in B-cell lymphomas. Upregulated NOVA1 expression seems to be a specific biological feature of activated T cells such as T- and NK-cell lymphomas.","altmetric_jid":"57c97924aee83ee7978b457a","authors":["Kim, Eun Kyung","Yoon, Sun Och","Kim, Soo Hee","Yang, Woo Ick","Cho, Yoon Ah","Kim, Soo Jeong"],"doi":"10.4132\/jptm.2016.02.08","first_seen_on":"2016-02-29T12:16:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2383-7837"],"journal":"Journal of Pathology and Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1456744097,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26922803?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26922803?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26922803","pubdate":"2016-02-29T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Upregulated Neuro-oncological Ventral Antigen 1 (NOVA1) Expression Is Specific to Mature and Immature T- and NK-Cell Lymphomas","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulated-neurooncological-ventral-antigen-1-nova1-expression-specific-mature-immature-t-nkcell-ly"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7313486,"mean":6.3735475029997,"rank":3007197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4200760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7313486,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282523,"mean":10.639495940139,"rank":111604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":165654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282523,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.694,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
