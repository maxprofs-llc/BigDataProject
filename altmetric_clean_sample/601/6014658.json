Further, to estimate a patient-specific lean body mass (LBM) from these MR-AC data.\nTen subjects were positioned in a fully-integrated PET\/MR system and three consecutive multi-bed acquisitions of the standard MR-AC image data were acquired. For each subject and MR-AC map, the following compartmental volumes were calculated: total-body (TB), soft tissue (ST), fat, lung, and intermediate tissue (IT). Intra-subject differences in TB and sub-compartmental volumes (ST, fat, lung and IT) were assessed by means of coefficients of variation (CV) calculated across the three consecutive measurements and, again, across these measurements but excluding those affected by major artifacts. All subjects underwent a body composition measurement using air displacement plethysmography (ADP) that was used to calculate a reference LBMADP. A second LBM estimate was derived from available MR-AC data using a formula incorporating the respective tissue volumes and densities as well as the subject-specific body weights. A third LBM estimate was obtained from a gender-specific formula (LBMFormula). Pearson's correlation was calculated for LBMADP, LBMMR-AC and LBMFormula. Further, linear regression analysis was performed on LBMMR-AC and LBMADP.\nMean CV for all 30 scans was (2.1\u00b11.9)% (TB). When excluding missing tissue artifacts, the CV was reduced to (0.3\u00b10.2)%. Mean CV for the sub-compartments before and after excluding artifacts was ST: (0.9\u00b11.1)% and (0.7\u00b10.7)%, fat: (2.9\u00b14.1)% and (1.3\u00b11.0)%, and IT: (3.6\u00b13.7)% and (1.3\u00b10.7)%, respectively. Correlation was highest for LBMMR-AC and LBMADP (r=0.99). Linear regression of data excluding artifacts resulted in a scaling factor of 1.06 for LBMMR-AC.\nLBMMR-AC is shown to correlate well with standard LBM measurements and thus offers routine LBM-based standardized uptake value quantification in PET\/MR. However, MR-AC images must be controlled for systematic artifacts, including missing tissue and tissue swaps. Efforts to minimize these artifacts could help improve the reproducibility of MR-AC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Rausch, Ivo","Rust, Petra","Difranco, Matthew D","Lassen, Martin","Stadlbauer, Andreas","Mayerhoefer, Marius E","Hartenbach, Markus","Hacker, Marcus","Beyer, Thomas"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.115.168294","first_seen_on":"2016-02-27T20:34:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1456605227,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26917707?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26917707","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:00:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Reproducibility of MRI Dixon-based attenuation correction in combined PET\/MR with applications for lean body mass estimation.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reproducibility-mri-dixonbased-attenuation-correction-combined-petmr-applications-lean-body-mass-est"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":5508099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282648,"mean":10.516227032305,"rank":198373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282648,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1978,"mean":3.9293141122913,"rank":1242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1978,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":4.9134757281553,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
