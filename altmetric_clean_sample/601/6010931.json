Recent investigations have\u00a0revealed the effect of the amount of ink (Laplace pressure) on the mechanism of liquid ink writing. In this study it is shown\u00a0that not only the amount of ink, but also physisorption and surface diffusion are relevant. After a few writing steps, physisorption and surface diffusion outweigh the influence of the amount of\u00a0ink, allowing consistent patterning governed by dwell times and writing speeds. Polymer matrices can be utilized as a\u00a0delivery medium to deposit functional particles. DPN patterning of polymer nanocomposites allows for local tuning of the\u00a0functionality and mechanical strength of the written patterns in high resolution, with the\u00a0benefit of pattern flexibility. Typically polymer matrices with volatile components are used as a\u00a0delivery medium for nanoparticle deposition, with subsequent removal of loosely bound matrix material by heating or oxygen plasma. In our study, nanocomposite patterns were constructed, and the\u00a0differences between polymer and nanocomposite patterning were investigated. Cross-sectional SEM and TEM analysis confirmed that nanoparticles can be deposited with the liquid-polymer ink and are evenly distributed in the polymer matrix.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Kandemir, Ayse Cagil","Erdem, Derya","Ma, Huan","Reiser, Alain","Spolenak, Ralph"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/27\/13\/135303","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T21:20:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1361-6528"],"issue":"13","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1456517110,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26909592?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26909592","pubdate":"2016-02-26T22:02:21+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Polymer nanocomposite patterning by dip-pen nanolithography","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymer-nanocomposite-patterning-dippen-nanolithography"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":3715310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2055097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484814304429,"rank":152248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1475,"mean":6.0449389416554,"rank":769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1475,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.7664347826087,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":3,"Chemistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/703309854383865856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6010931],"posted_on":"2016-02-26T20:05:10+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"703309854383865856"}]}}
