In this work, we for the first time reported a double-stem hairpin probe (DHP) that was simultaneously engineered to incorporate a DNAzyme, DNAzyme's complementary fragment and nicking enzyme recognition site. The important aspect of this hairpin probe is that, although it is designed to have a long ds DNA fragment, no intermolecular interaction occurs, circumventing the sticky-end pairing-determined disadvantages encountered by classic molecular beacon. For the DHP-based colorimetric sensing system, as a model analyte, cancer-related DNA sequence can trigger a cascade polymerization\/nicking cycle on only one oligonucleotide probe. This led to the dramatic accumulation of G-quadruplexes directly responsible for colorimetric signal conversion without any loss. As a result, the target DNA is capable of being detected to 1 fM (six to eight orders of magnitude lower than that of catalytic molecular beacons) and point mutations are distinguished by the naked eye. The described DHP as a-proof-of-concept would not only promote the design of colorimetric biosensors but also open a good way to promote the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc86","authors":["Xu, Jianguo","Li, Hongling","Wu, Zai-Sheng","Qian, Jun","Xue, Chang","Jia, Lee"],"doi":"10.7150\/thno.13533","first_seen_on":"2016-02-26T22:51:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1838-7640"],"issue":"3","journal":"Theranostics","last_mentioned_on":1456522683,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26909108?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26909108","pubdate":"2016-02-27T22:03:52+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","nanotechnology","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Double-stem Hairpin Probe and Ultrasensitive Colorimetric Detection of Cancer-related Nucleic Acids","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doublestem-hairpin-probe-ultrasensitive-colorimetric-detection-cancerrelated-nucleic-acids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7289383,"mean":6.3680766857843,"rank":5502020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7289383,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282431,"mean":10.484829175371,"rank":198032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":44732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282431,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":2.5220137931034,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.3473684210526,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
