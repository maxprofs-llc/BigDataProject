BHK-21 cells infected with YN12031 exhibited an evident cytopathic effect (CPE) 32 h post-infection. The virus particles were spherical, 70 nm in diameter, and enveloped; they also featured surface fibers. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that YN12031 was closely related to alpha viruses such as Chikungunya virus and Sindbis virus, and located in the same clade as MM2021, the prototype of Getahvirus (GETV) isolated in Malaysia in 1955. Phylogenetic analysis of the E2 and capsid genes further revealed that YN12031 was located in the same clade as the Russian isolate LEIV\/16275\/Mag. Analysis of the homology of nucleotides and amino acids in the coding area and E2 gene demonstrated that the YN12031 isolated from the China-Laos border (tropical region) was related closest to the LEIV\/16275\/Mag isolate obtained in Russia (North frigid zone area) among other isolates studied. These results suggest that GETV can adapt to different geographical environments to propagate and evolve. Thus, strengthening the detection and monitoring of GETV and its related diseases is very crucial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064b9","authors":["Li, Yuan Yuan","Fu, Shi Hong","Guo, Xiao Fang","Lei, Wen Wen","Li, Xiao Long","Song, Jing Dong","Cao, Lei","Gao, Xiao Yan","Lyu, Zhi","He, Ying","Wang, Huan Yu","Ren, Xiao Jie","Zhou, Hong Ning","Wang, Gui Qin","Liang, Guo Dong"],"doi":"10.3967\/bes2017.028","first_seen_on":"2017-04-22T10:04:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0895-3988"],"issue":"3","journal":"Biomedical & Environmental Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1492925736,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28427491?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28427491","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Identification of a Newly Isolated Getah Virus in the China-Laos Border, China.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-newly-isolated-getah-virus-chinalaos-border-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091674,"mean":6.8840357008911,"rank":5857217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1946699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091674,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233280,"mean":12.760280042352,"rank":151587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":68002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233280,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192,"mean":4.0020837696335,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sendai_Virus\/statuses\/855723877984419840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19351184],"posted_on":"2017-04-22T10:04:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Viral Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/829935214071656448\/6JT40dMn_normal.jpg","description":"Virus Researcher in Sendai, Japan \u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u5b66\u3068\u611f\u67d3\u75c7\u9818\u57df\u306e\u8ad6\u6587\u3092\u53ce\u96c6\u3057\u3066\u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30c8\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051","id_on_source":"Sendai_Virus","tweeter_id":"829900946817691648","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":44},"tweet_id":"855723877984419840"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/phy_papers\/statuses\/855863805204586496","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19351184],"posted_on":"2017-04-22T19:20:06+00:00","author":{"name":"phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438115152294989824\/0M7ZG0xC_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for phylogenetics papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ PrePrints.
