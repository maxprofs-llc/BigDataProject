However, it has also been shown that Verteporfin can have non-photoactivated effects such as interference with the YAP-TEAD complex of the HIPPO pathway, resulting in growth inhibition of several neoplasias. More recently, it was proposed that, another non-light mediated effect of VP is the formation of cross-linked oligomers and high molecular weight protein complexes (HMWC) that are hypothesized to interfere with autophagy and cell growth. Here, in a series of experiments, using human uveal melanoma cells (MEL 270), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) and breast cancer cells (MCF7) we showed that Verteporfin-induced HMWC require the presence of light. Furthermore, we showed that the mechanism of this cross-linking, which involves both singlet oxygen and radical generation, can occur very efficiently even after lysis of the cells, if the lysate is not protected from ambient light. This work offers a better understanding regarding VP's mechanisms of action and suggests caution when one studies the non-light mediated actions of this drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Konstantinou, Eleni K.","Notomi, Shoji","Kosmidou, Cassandra","Brodowska, Katarzyna","Al-Moujahed, Ahmad","Nicolaou, Fotini","Tsoka, Pavlina","Gragoudas, Evangelos","Miller, Joan W.","Young, Lucy H.","Vavvas, Demetrios G."],"doi":"10.1038\/srep46581","first_seen_on":"2017-04-22T10:05:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1492855489,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28429726?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28429726","pubdate":"2017-04-22T22:04:43+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Molecular biology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical research","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Verteporfin-induced formation of protein cross-linked oligomers and high molecular weight complexes is mediated by light and leads to cell toxicity","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/verteporfininduced-formation-protein-crosslinked-oligomers-high-molecular-weight-complexes-mediated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088698,"mean":6.8825438942685,"rank":7002905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088698,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233076,"mean":12.761228265579,"rank":189778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233076,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33371,"mean":14.864963380282,"rank":28215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33371,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3248,"mean":18.196157068063,"rank":2576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3248,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Ph.
