The synthesized aluminum complexes were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The solid-state structures of complexes and were determined using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Upon addition of 1 equivalent of benzyl alcohol, all complexes were efficient initiators for the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of rac-lactide (rac-LA) and \u03b5-caprolactone (\u03b5-CL). The polymerizations were living with a good control over molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. Under immortal polymerization conditions, all four-coordinate aluminum complexes () exhibited a living polymerization with the obtained molecular weights proportional to the ratio of monomer\/benzyl alcohol and the PDIs were narrow. Kinetic studies revealed that both rac-LA and \u03b5-CL polymerizations mediated by all complexes were first-order in monomers. The effects of ligand structure and coordination geometry on the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity were discussed. A good isoselectivity control was achieved for the polymerizations mediated by complexes (Pm = 0.75), (Pm = 0.74), and (Pm = 0.74).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Pattarawut Sumrit","Pitak Chuawong","Tanin Nanok","Tanwawan Duangthongyou","Pimpa Hormnirun"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt00990e","endpage":"9266","first_seen_on":"2016-05-16T09:36:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"22","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463390350,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2016\/DT\/C6DT00990E?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/dt\/c6dt00990e","pmid":"27180841","pubdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"9250","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Aluminum complexes containing salicylbenzoxazole ligands and their application in the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide and \u03b5-caprolactone","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aluminum-complexes-containing-salicylbenzoxazole-ligands-application-ringopening-polymerization-racl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7705951,"mean":6.6114203323351,"rank":6666259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7705951,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269509,"mean":11.456830476275,"rank":224879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269509,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10835,"mean":0.68176278382869,"rank":3031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10835,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":0.74411764705882,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
