One study suggests a potential detrimental role for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in sepsis; however, the immune-regulatory effects of TSLP on myeloid cells within the intestinal microenvironment suggest the contrary.\nTo clarify thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) role in sepsis.\nCecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was performed in mice with total or myeloid-specific deficiency in the receptor for TSLP. Survival was monitored closely, peritoneal fluids and plasma were analyzed for markers of inflammation, myeloid cell numbers and their ability to produce inflammatory mediators was determined.\nThe interaction of TSLP with its receptor in myeloid cells contributed to mouse survival after septic peritonitis. Mice with TSLP-receptor deficiency in myeloid cells displayed excessive local and systemic inflammation levels (e.g., increased inflammatory cell and cytokine levels) relative to control mice. Moreover, hepatic injury was exacerbated in mice with TSLP receptor deficiency in their myeloid cells. However, the enhanced inflammatory response did not affect the ability for these mice to clear bacteria. Resident neutrophils and macrophages from septic mice with TSLP receptor deficiency exhibited an increased ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nCollectively, our findings suggest that the effects of TSLP on myeloid cells are crucial in reducing the multiple organ failure that is associated with systemic inflammation, which highlights the significance of this cytokine in modulating the host response to infection and in reducing the risks of sepsis development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Piliponsky, Adrian M","Lahiri, Asha","Truong, Phuong","Clauson, Morgan","Shubin, Nicholas J","Han, Hongwei","Ziegler, Steven F","Adrian M.
