This increased international interest in public policy in support of the structural determinants of health has had little traction in the United States. This should be surprising since the United States presents one of the worst population health profiles and public policy environments in support of health among wealthy developed nations. The U.S. position as a health status and policy outlier results from long-term institutional changes that are shaped by political, economic, and social forces. U.S. public health researchers' and workers' neglect of these structural and public policy issues conforms to the dominant ideological discourses that serve to justify these changes. The author presents some means by which public health researchers and workers can challenge these dominant discourses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059a4","authors":["Dennis Raphael"],"doi":"10.2190\/hs.38.1.d","endpage":"94","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T20:37:00+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0020-7314","1541-4469"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Health Services","last_mentioned_on":1479915295,"links":["http:\/\/m.joh.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/1\/63.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/joh.sagepub.com\/content\/38\/1\/63.full.pdf","pmid":"18341123","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"Shaping Public Policy and Population Health in the United States: Why is the Public Health Community Missing in Action?","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shaping-public-policy-population-health-united-states-public-health-community-missing-action-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":3201195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4494926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284010,"mean":10.821708945843,"rank":111473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":170583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284010,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":7.9191954022989,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":9.2181818181818,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/brianrahmer\/statuses\/706216385114931204","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6125828],"posted_on":"2016-03-05T20:34:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Rahmer","url":"https:\/\/goo.gl\/ZllurF","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/718894088855121920\/qqi1FiIw_normal.jpg","description":"Dad to three, connecting the dots. #HiAP #SDoH Power, Politics, Privilege, & The People's Health.
