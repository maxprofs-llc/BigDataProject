Thus, neutrophil activation must be tightly regulated to prevent indiscriminant damage. Previously, we reported that mice lacking matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 7 are protected from lung injury due to markedly impaired neutrophil movement from the interstitium into mucosal lumenal spaces. This phenotype resulted from a lack of MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1 (Sdc1), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that carries the neutrophil chemokine KC\/CXCL1 as cargo. Here, we assessed if shedding syndecan-1\/CXCL1 complexes affects neutrophil activation. Whereas injured monolayers of wildtype alveolar type II cells potently stimulated neutrophil activation, as gauged by release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), cells from Mmp7-\/- or Sdc1-\/- mice or human cells with MMP7 knock down did not. In vivo, we observed reduced MPO release relative to neutrophil numbers in bleomycin-injured Mmp7-\/- and Sdc1-\/- mice. Furthermore, we determined that soluble syndecan-1 directly stimulated neutrophil activation in the absence of cellular damage. These data indicate that MMP7 shedding of syndecan-1\/KC complexes functions as a checkpoint that restricts neutrophil activation at sites of epithelial injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698a","authors":["Gill, Sean E","Nadler, Samuel T","Li, Qinglang","Frevert, Charles W","Park, Pyong Woo","Chen, Peter","Parks, William C","Sean E.
