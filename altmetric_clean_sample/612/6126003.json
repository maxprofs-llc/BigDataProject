The literature reveals that sinapic acid is a bioactive phenolic acid and has the potential to attenuate various chemically induced toxicities. This minireview is an effort to summarize the available literature about pharmacokinetic, therapeutic, and protective potential of this versatile molecule in health related areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008425","authors":["Chen, Chunye"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/3571614","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T21:21:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1942-0900","1942-0994"],"journal":"Oxidative Medicine & Cellular Longetivity","last_mentioned_on":1460654865,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/omcl\/2016\/3571614\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27069529"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/omcl\/2016\/3571614.pdf","pmid":"27069529","pubdate":"2015-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","startpage":"1","subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Sinapic Acid and Its Derivatives as Medicine in Oxidative Stress-Induced Diseases and Aging","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sinapic-acid-derivatives-medicine-oxidative-stressinduced-diseases-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":641828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6905146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282528,"mean":10.768145925876,"rank":35628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":246619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282528,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":738,"mean":4.0288629579376,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":738,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":2.425,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
