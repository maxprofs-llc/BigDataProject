The aim of this double- blind placebo- controlled parallel- arm randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the clinical effects of a Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1-containing probiotic sachet as an adjunct to non-surgical therapy.\nTwenty-eight systemically healthy volunteer with chronic periodontitis were recruited and monitored clinically at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after therapy. Clinical parameters measured included plaque accumulation, bleeding on probing, pocket probing depths (PPD) and clinical attachment loss. Patients received non-surgical therapy including scaling and root planing (SRP) and were randomly assigned to a test (SRP + probiotic, n = 14) or control (SRP + placebo, n = 14) group. The intake, once a day for 3 months, of a L. rhamnosus SP1 probiotic sachet commenced after the last session of SRP.\nBoth test and control groups showed improvements in clinical parameters at all time points evaluated. The test group, however, showed greater reductions in PPD than the control. Also, at initial visits and after 1-year follow-up, the test group showed a statistically significant reduction in number of participants with PPD \u2265 6mm, indicating a reduced need for surgery, in contrast to the placebo group.\nThe results of this trial indicate that oral administration of L. rhamnosus SP1 resulted in similar clinical improvements compared to SRP alone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f7c","authors":["Morales, Alicia","Carvajal, Paola","Silva, Nora","Hernandez, Marcela","Godoy, Claudia","Rodriguez, Gonzalo","Cabello, Rodrigo","Garcia-Sesnich, Jocelyn","Hoare, Anilei","Diaz, Patricia I","Gamonal, Jorge"],"doi":"10.1902\/jop.2016.150665","first_seen_on":"2016-03-06T17:22:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-3670","0022-3492"],"journal":"Journal of Periodontology","last_mentioned_on":1459607774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26944407"],"pmid":"26944407","pubdate":"2016-03-06T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Clinical Effects of Lactobacillus Rhamnosus in Non-Surgical Treatment of Chronic Periodontitis: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial With 1-Year F..","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-effects-lactobacillus-rhamnosus-nonsurgical-treatment-chronic-periodontitis-randomized-plac"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":3635273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3652420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281587,"mean":10.750802568309,"rank":141057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":130005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281587,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":547,"mean":4.4276483516484,"rank":328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":547,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.6772307692308,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
