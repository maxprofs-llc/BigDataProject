Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in general, and MR phase contrast (PC) imaging in particular have emerged as potential techniques for standardized assessment of cardiovascular function, morphology, and hemodynamics in PH. Allowing the quantification and characterization of macroscopic cardiovascular blood flow, MR PC imaging offers non-invasive evaluation of hemodynamic alterations associated with PH. Techniques used to study the PH include both the routine two-dimensional (2D) approach measuring predominant velocities through an acquisition plane, and the rapidly evolving four-dimensional (4D) PC imaging, which enables assessment of the complete time-resolved, three-directional blood flow velocity field in a volume. Numerous parameters such as pulmonary arterial mean velocity, vessel distensibility, flow acceleration time and volume, tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity, as well as duration and onset of vortical blood flow in the main pulmonary artery, have been explored to either diagnose PH or find non-invasive correlates to right heart catheter parameters. Furthermore, PC imaging-based analysis of pulmonary arterial pulse wave velocities, wall shear stress, and kinetic energy losses grant novel insights into cardiopulmonary remodeling in PH. This review aims to outline the current applications of 2D and 4D PC imaging in PH and show why this technique has the potential to contribute significantly to early diagnosis and characterization of PH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002453","authors":["Reiter, Ursula","Reiter, Gert","Fuchsj\u00e4ger, Michael"],"doi":"10.1259\/bjr.20150995","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T14:43:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-880X"],"journal":"British Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1457188987,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26942293?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26942293","pubdate":"2016-03-05T22:00:36+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Magnetic resonance phase contrast imaging in pulmonary hypertension.  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mr-phasecontrast-imaging-pulmonary-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":6356699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280860,"mean":10.695222777265,"rank":236910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280860,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":773,"mean":2.4879404145078,"rank":626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":773,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.3271515151515,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
