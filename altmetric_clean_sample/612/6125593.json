Cotton is a pioneer crop with regard to salt stress tolerance, and can be used for saline-alkali land improvement. The large-scale detection of salt tolerance traits in cotton accessions, and the identification of elite quantitative trait loci (QTLs)\/genes for salt-tolerance have been very important in salt tolerance breeding. Here, 43 advanced salt-tolerant and 31 highly salt-sensitive cultivars were detected by analyzing ten salt tolerance related traits in 304 upland cotton cultivars. Among them, 11 advanced salt-tolerance and eight highly salt-sensitive cultivars were consistent with previously reported results. Association analysis of ten salt-tolerance related traits and 145 SSRs was performed, and a total of 95 significant associations were detected; 17, 41, and 37 of which were associated with germinative index, seedling stage physiological index, and four seedling stage biochemical indexes, respectively. Of these associations, 20 SSR loci were simultaneously associated with two or more traits. Furthermore, we detected 117 elite alleles associated with salt-tolerance traits, 4 of which were reported previously. Among these loci, 44 (37.60%) were rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5%, 6 only existed in advanced salt-tolerant cultivars, and 2 only in highly salt-sensitive cultivars. As a result, 13 advanced salt-tolerant cultivars were selected to assemble the optimal cross combinations by computer simulation for the development of salt-tolerant accessions. This study lays solid foundations for further improvements in cotton salt-tolerance by referencing elite germplasms, alleles associated with salt-tolerance traits, and optimal crosses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Lei Du","Caiping Cai","Shuang Wu","Fang Zhang","Sen Hou","Wangzhen Guo"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0151076","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T19:28:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1457337090,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0151076"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0151076.PDF","pmid":"26943816","pubdate":"2016-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0151076","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Evaluation and Exploration of Favorable QTL Alleles for Salt Stress Related Traits in Cotton Cultivars ( G . hirsutum L.)","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-exploration-favorable-qtl-alleles-salt-stress-related-traits-cotton-cultivars-g-hirsutum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7361241,"mean":6.3959791151997,"rank":5566093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":994894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7361241,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280875,"mean":10.698674843524,"rank":197179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280875,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105350,"mean":10.153657974922,"rank":77077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":16449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105350,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5444,"mean":12.007682528018,"rank":4242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5444,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
