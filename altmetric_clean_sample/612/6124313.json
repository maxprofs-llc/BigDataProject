They search for high-quality information in plain language, from independent sources, based on reliable and up-to-date evidence. The Integrating and Deriving Evidence, Experiences and Preferences (IN-DEEP) project in Italy and Australia aimed to provide people with MS and family members with an online source of evidence-based information, starting from their information needs. This paper reports on the Italian project's website.\nContents, layout and wording were developed with people with MS and pilot-tested. The website was evaluated using an online 29-item questionnaire for ease of language, contents, navigation, and usefulness of information aimed at people with MS, family members and the general population.\nThe website ( http:\/\/indeep.istituto-besta.it\/ ) is structured in multiple levels of information. The first topic was interferons-\u03b2 for people with relapsing-remitting MS. In all, 433 people responded to the survey (276 people with MS, 68 family members and 89 others). The mean age was 45\u00a0years, almost 90\u00a0% had a high school diploma, about 80\u00a0% had relapsing-remitting MS, and the median disease duration was seven years. About 90\u00a0% judged the website clear, understandable, useful, and easy to navigate. Ninety percent of people with MS and family members would recommend it to others. Sixty-two percent reported they felt confident in making decisions on interferons-\u03b2 after reading the website.\nThe model was judged clear and useful. It could be adapted to other topics and diseases. Clinicians may find it useful in their relationship with patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cc","authors":["Colombo, Cinzia","Filippini, Graziella","Synnot, Anneliese","Hill, Sophie","Guglielmino, Roberta","Traversa, Silvia","Confalonieri, Paolo","Mosconi, Paola","Tramacere, Irene","Cinzia Colombo","Graziella Filippini","Anneliese Synnot","Sophie Hill","Roberta Guglielmino","Silvia Traversa","Paolo Confalonieri","Paola Mosconi","Irene Tramacere"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12883-016-0552-0","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T11:36:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2377"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1457177776,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26934873?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26934873","pubdate":"2016-03-05T22:03:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Development and assessment of a website presenting evidence-based information for people with multiple sclerosis: the IN-DEEP project","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2377\/16\/30","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-assessment-website-presenting-evidencebased-information-people-multiple-sclerosis-indeep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":6356569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280860,"mean":10.695175066492,"rank":236857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280860,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1141,"mean":5.0930859649123,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1141,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.7469032258065,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
