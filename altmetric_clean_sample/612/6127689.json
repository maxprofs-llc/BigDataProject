Here, norfloxacin (NFLX) is decorated abundantly on the surface of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer via amide linkage to form PAMAM-NFLX complex. Thus, the resultant PAMAM-NFLX can serve as a novel co-reactant to efficiently amplify the ECL signal of peroxydisulfate-oxygen (S2O8(2-)-O2) system. Pd@Au HOHs were used as nano-carriers to assemble detection antibody (Ab2) and the PAMAM-NFLX complex. Besides, it can further enhance the ECL signal by promoting the generation of intermediate free radical HO(\u2022) during the ECL reaction of S2O8(2-)-O2 system. The proposed immunosensor shows high sensitivity and specificity, and responds linearly to the concentration of TSH from 0.05 to 20\u03bcIUmL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.02\u03bcIUmL(-1) (S\/N=3). Moreover, the immunosensor successfully achieves the detection of TSH in practical human blood serum with desirable results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f7","authors":["Liu, Yuting","Zhang, Qiqi","Wang, Haijun","Yuan, Yali","Chai, Yaqin","Yuan, Ruo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bios.2015.04.022","first_seen_on":"2016-03-06T09:31:26+00:00","issns":["1873-4235"],"journal":"Biosensors & Bioelectronics","last_mentioned_on":1457255680,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25897886?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25897886","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"An electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for thyroid stimulating hormone based on polyamidoamine-norfloxacin functionalized Pd-Au core-shell hexoct..","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrochemiluminescence-immunosensor-thyroid-stimulating-hormone-based-polyamidoaminenorfloxacin-fu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7356005,"mean":6.3917145915054,"rank":3771283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2062825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7356005,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280618,"mean":10.69807049466,"rank":151777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":99645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280618,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1833,"mean":2.7590240174673,"rank":695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1833,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":2.654756302521,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
