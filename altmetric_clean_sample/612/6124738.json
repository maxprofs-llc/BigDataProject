However, they exhibit unacceptable catalytic activity in acid medium. Here, a hierarchically porous Co-N functionalized graphene aerogel is prepared as an efficient catalyst for the ORR in acid electrolyte. In the preparation process, polyaniline (PANI) is introduced as a pore-forming agent to aid in the self-assembly of graphene species into a porous aerogel networks, and a nitrogen precursor to induce in situ nitrogen doping. Therefore, a Co-N decorated graphene aerogel framework with a large surface area (485 m(2) g(-1)) and an abundance of meso\/macropores is effectively formed after heat treatment. Such highly desired structures can not only expose sufficient active sites for the ORR but also guarantee the fast mass transfer in the catalytic process, which provides significant catalytic activity with positive onset and half wave potentials, low hydrogen peroxide yield, high resistance to methanol crossover, and remarkable stability that is comparable to commercial Pt\/C in acid medium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Fu, Xiaogang","Choi, Ja-Yeon","Zamani, Pouyan","Jiang, Gaopeng","Hoque, Md Ariful","Hassan, Fathy Mohamed","Chen, Zhongwei"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b12746","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T13:13:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1457183580,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26937737?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26937737","pubdate":"2016-03-05T22:02:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
