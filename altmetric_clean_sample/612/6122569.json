The cathodic catalysts faced with a liquid phase are easily primed with the electrolyte, which provides more surface area for bacterial overgrowth, resulting in the difficulty in transporting protons to active sites. Ag\/Fe\/N\/C composites prepared from Ag and Fe-chelated melamine are used as antibacterial ORR catalysts for SC-MFCs. The structure-activity correlations for Ag\/Fe\/N\/C are investigated by tuning the carbonization temperature (600-1000 oC) to clarify how the active-constituents of Ag\/Fe and N-species influence the antibacterial and ORR activities. A maximum power density of 1791 mW m-2 is obtained by Ag\/Fe\/N\/C (630 oC), which is far higher than that of Pt\/C (1192 mW m-2), only having a decline of 16.14 % after 90 d of running. The Fe-bonded N and the cooperation of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N in Ag\/Fe\/N\/C contribute equally to the highly catalytic activity toward ORR. The \u2022OH or O2- species originating from the catalysis of O2 can suppress the biofilm growth on Ag\/Fe\/N\/C cathodes. The synergistic effects between the Ag\/Fe heterojunction and N-species substantially contribute to the high power output and coulombic efficiency of Ag\/Fe\/N\/C catalysts. These new antibacterial ORR catalysts show promise for application in MFCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Dai, Ying","Chan, Yingzi","Jiang, Baojiang","Wang, Lei","Zou, Jinlong","Pan, Kai","Fu, Honggang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsami.5b11561","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T11:06:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-8252"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1457175972,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26938657?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26938657","pubdate":"2016-03-05T22:02:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
