Both groups of immunosuppressants have wide effects and are focused against the T cells, although the different impact on specific T cell subsets, such as regulatory T cells (TREG ), has been demonstrated. A greater knowledge of the impact of immunosuppression on the cellular components involved in allograft rejection could facilitate the decision of individualized immunosuppression when an acute rejection event is suspected. Memory T cells have recently gained focus since they might induce a more potent response as compared to na\u00efve ones. The impact of immunosuppressants on different memory T cell subsets remains unclear.\nIn the present study, we have studied the specific impact of CNI (Tacrolimus) and mTORi (Rapamycin and Everolimus) over memory and na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells. To do so, we have analyzed the proliferation, phenotypic changes and cytokine synthesis in vitro in presence of these immunosuppressants.\nThe present work shows a more potent effect of CNI on proliferation and cytokine production in na\u00efve and memory T cells. However, the mTORi permit the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells to the memory phenotype and allow the production of IL-2.\nAltogether, our data show evidence for the combined use of CNI and mTORi in transplant immunosuppression.
