Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a distended and edematous ileum and an intra-abdominal abscess adjacent to the mesentery with a normal appendix. The patient's general condition did not improve with antibiotics, so an ileocecectomy was performed.\nYersinia pseudotuberculosis infection requiring an operation is rare. In our case, antibiotics were not effective in treating the abscess therefore surgery was required. An early diagnosis using serological studies, ultrasound of the abdomen, and fecal culture, with appropriate administration of antibiotics, may have avoided the need for surgery. Considering YP infection as a differential diagnosis is therefore important when encountering patients with enterocolitis, especially with right lower quadrant pain. Early diagnosis may assist in avoiding unnecessary operations.\nDiagnosis of YP infection may be missed or delayed because it is rare and difficult to detect, and must be distinguished from appendicitis. Although most YP infections are self-limiting, some rare cases will require surgery, therefore early diagnosis is essential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f2","authors":["Kimura, Jiro","Sasaki, Kiyoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijscr.2016.02.039","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T12:20:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22102612","2210-2612"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1457179340,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S2210261216300049&_version=1&md5=d97fc179eaeeefdb80d168ba196ebd4a"],"pmid":"27002288","pubdate":"2016-03-24T22:02:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection intractable by antibiotics: A rare case report ","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection-intractable-antibiotics-rare-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":5558598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280860,"mean":10.695199812005,"rank":197127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43992,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280860,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":746,"mean":2.0339087248322,"rank":250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":746,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":3.7161553398058,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSCaseReports\/statuses\/706087448011341824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6124463],"posted_on":"2016-03-05T12:02:20+00:00","author":{"name":"IJS Case Reports","url":"http:\/\/www.casereports.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681556822805843970\/-0rB28HV_normal.png","description":"The Largest Journal for Surgical Case Reports in the World.
