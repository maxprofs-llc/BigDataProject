PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Patients with encapsulated colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) have a better prognosis than those without a capsule. The reason for the encapsulation is unknown. Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) increases tumor angiogenesis and tumor tissue expression is associated with reduced survival. Our aim was to determine whether the good prognosis of encapsulated CRLM is associated with reduced HIF-1\u03b1 expression by the cancer.The study selected only patients who had not undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to a potentially curative hepatectomy for CRLM. From 30 selected patients, serial sections were cut from a single randomly selected metastasis. Morphology was assessed following H&E staining. Tumor hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), proliferation, and microvascular density (MVD) were assessed by immunostaining for HIF-1\u03b1 and carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA-9), VEGF, Ki67, and cluster of differentiation-31, respectively. MVD was calculated in the vascular hot spots. Pathology was reported without clinical outcome information. Actual long-term survival was recorded.Thirteen (43%) of the cancers were encapsulated CRLM containing glands which were large, complex, and cribriform. Thirteen (43%) were infiltrative CRLM and their glands were small, closely packed, and rounded with vessels in the interglandular fibrous tissue with no capsule; 3 (10%) had a mixed picture. Encapsulated CRLM had a higher expression of HIF-1\u03b1 (58% vs 8%, P\u200a=\u200a0.03), CA-9 (42% vs 0%, P\u200a=\u200a0.04), and VEGF (92% vs 25%, P\u200a=\u200a0.02). MVD was lower in the encapsulated CRLM group (37\u200amm vs 143\u200amm, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). The median follow-up was 115 months. The encapsulated CRLM group had a better overall and 5-year survival (relative hazard: 0.58, P\u200a=\u200a0.057 and hazard ratio: 0.52, P = 0.044).There are 2 main morphological appearances of CRLM which have very different long-term survival following liver resection surgery. The morphology is associated with differences in expression of HIF-1\u03b1, CA-9, VEGF, and angiogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Siriwardana, Pulathis N","Luong, Tu Vinh","Watkins, Jennifer","Turley, Helen","Ghazaley, Mohamed","Gatter, Kevin","Harris, Adrian L","Hochhauser, Daniel","Davidson, Brian R"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000002924","first_seen_on":"2016-03-05T14:50:52+00:00","funders":["niehs","cruk","mrc"],"issns":["1536-5964"],"issue":"8","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1469187353,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26937938?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26937938?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26937938","pubdate":"2016-03-05T22:02:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Biological and Prognostic Significance of the Morphological Types and Vascular Patterns in Colorectal Liver Metastases (CRLM): Looking Beyond the T..","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-prognostic-significance-morphological-types-vascular-patterns-colorectal-liver-metastases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":5857235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1946648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285949,"mean":10.98507039042,"rank":185675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":83543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285949,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4036,"mean":2.9454765799256,"rank":2045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1523,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4036,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":2.2158983050847,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
