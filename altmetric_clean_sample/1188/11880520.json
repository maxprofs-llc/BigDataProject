Among the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in our previous report using large-scale microarray screening, the downregulation of miR-378 in the peri-infarct region of middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO) mice can be reversed by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC). In this study, the role of miR-378 in the ischemic injury was further explored. We found that miR-378 levels significantly decreased in N2A cells following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Overexpression of miR-378 significantly enhanced cell viability, decreased TUNEL-positive cells and the immunoreactivity of cleaved-caspase-3. Conversely, downregulation of miR-378 aggravated OGD-induced apoptosis and ischemic injury. By using bioinformatic algorithms, we discovered that miR-378 may directly bind to the predicted 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Caspase-3 gene. The protein level of caspase-3 increased significantly upon OGD treatment, and can be downregulated by pri-miR-378 transfection. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding of miR-378 to the 3'-UTR of Caspase-3 mRNA and repressed its translation. In addition, miR-378 agomir decreased cleaved-caspase-3 ratio, reduced infarct volume and neural cell death induced by MCAO. Furthermore, caspase-3 knockdown could reverse anti-miR-378 mediated neuronal injury. Taken together, our data demonstrated that miR-378 attenuated ischemic injury by negatively regulating the apoptosis executioner, caspase-3, providing a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Zhang, Nan","Zhong, Jie","Han, Song","Li, Yun","Yin, Yanling","Li, Junfa","Nan Zhang","Jie Zhong","Song Han","Yun Li","Yanling Yin","Junfa Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17091427","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T13:25:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"9","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1490406724,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27598143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27598143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms17091427"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/9\/1427\/pdf","pmid":"27598143","pubdate":"2016-09-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1427","title":"MicroRNA-378 Alleviates Cerebral Ischemic Injury by Negatively Regulating Apoptosis Executioner Caspase-3","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/9\/1427","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna378-alleviates-cerebral-ischemic-injury-negatively-regulating-apoptosis-executioner-caspase3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253195,"mean":12.48936380009,"rank":178379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253195,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5435,"mean":2.3846959882223,"rank":3162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5435,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":2.7566728395062,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
