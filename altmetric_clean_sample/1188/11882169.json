While RPA gives too weak binding, underestimating the reference data by 13.7% on average, much improved results are obtained when the singles are included at the GW singles excitations (GWSE) level, with average absolute difference to the reference data of only 3.7%. Consistently with previous results, we find a very good agreement with the reference data for hydrogen bonded systems, while the binding is too weak for systems where dispersion forces dominate. In fact, the overall accuracy of the RPA+GWSE method is similar to an estimated accuracy of the reference data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Ji\u0159\u00ed Klime\u0161","Ji\u0159\u00ed Klime\u0161"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4962188","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T15:22:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-7690"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1473261707,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/jcp\/145\/9\/10.1063\/1.4962188?TRACK=RSS&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"27609003","pubdate":"2016-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Lattice energies of molecular solids from the random phase approximation with singles corrections","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lattice-energies-molecular-solids-random-phase-approximation-singles-corrections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":6331027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1129857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252570,"mean":12.454536661268,"rank":178518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":41737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252570,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5782,"mean":2.7173018508908,"rank":3121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5782,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":3.9292748538012,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
