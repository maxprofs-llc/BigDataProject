Each subject consumed isocaloric amounts of either the standard ONS or the diabetes-specific formula ONS on different dates, 1\u2005week apart. Glucose and insulin measures were recorded at baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240\u2005min after the beverage was consumed and then used to calculate area under the curve (AUC) for each subject.\nThe mean glucose AUC was lower in the diabetes-specific ONS group than in the standard group (p<0.0001), but there was not a significant difference observed for mean insulin AUC (p=0.068). A sensitivity analysis of the mean insulin AUC measures was performed by removing a potential outlier from the analysis, and this resulted in a significant difference between the groups (p=0.012). First-phase insulin measures and an insulinogenic index calculated for the beverages showed no significant differences.\nOn the basis of the results of this trial of 12 subjects, the diabetes-specific ONS appears to provide better glucose maintenance in persons with type 2 diabetes when compared to the standard formula ONS.\nNCT02612675.","altmetric_jid":"538ee21b2a83ee2c148b4568","authors":["Maureen B Huhmann","Kristen N Smith","Sherwyn L Schwartz","Stacie K Haller","Sarah Irvin","Sarah S Cohen","Huhmann, Maureen B","Smith, Kristen N","Schwartz, Sherwyn L","Haller, Stacie K","Irvin, Sarah","Cohen, Sarah S"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjdrc-2016-000240","first_seen_on":"2016-09-07T14:02:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[" 2052-4897","2052-4897"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care","last_mentioned_on":1481028759,"links":["http:\/\/drc.bmj.com\/content\/4\/1\/e000240.full.pdf%20html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27648290?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/drc.bmj.com\/content\/4\/1\/e000240.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/drc.bmj.com\/content\/4\/1\/e000240.full.pdf","pmid":"27648290","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Diabetes Association","startpage":"e000240","title":"Plasma glucose and insulin response to two oral nutrition supplements in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-glucose-insulin-response-two-oral-nutrition-supplements-adults-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":3107853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4719787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246827,"mean":12.261183173571,"rank":90244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":155198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246827,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193,"mean":18.005,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":52.181739130435,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
