In 2013, mutations in the propeller domain of the kelch protein K13 was found to be associated with artemisinin resistance. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Day-3 parasitaemia, estimate the frequency of k13 molecular marker and assess their relationship in the context of operational research.\nBlood smears and filter paper blood spots were collected from febrile patients in Kravanh District, Pursat Province. The blood smears were examined by microscopy, and blood spots by a k13 mutation assay.\nData from 92 patients were analysed. Only one was positive for Day-3 parasitaemia. Results of the k13 assay were interpretable for 76 of the 92 samples. The findings were: wild type: 9 (12%), C580Y: 64 (84%), Y493H: 3 (4%). Therefore, despite the high prevalence of k13 mutants (67\/76: 88%), only 1 of the 92 patients remained blood smear positive for Plasmodium falciparum on Day-3.\nThese preliminary findings suggest good potency of artemisinin despite the dominance of k13 mutation in Kravanh, but the result is not necessarily representative of the western part of Cambodia. Further investigation should be made to determine if k13 marker remains useful as a tool for tracking artemisinin resistance and predicting the trend of the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapy once the mutant alleles have been well established in the population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Soy Ty Kheang","Siv Sovannaroth","Sovann Ek","Say Chy","Phally Chhun","Sokkieng Mao","Sokomar Nguon","Dy Soley Lek","Didier Menard","Neeraj Kak"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12936-017-2024-4","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T17:26:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1505470043,"links":["https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12936-017-2024-4?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12936-017-2024-4","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28903755?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12936-017-2024-4?site=malariajournal.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28903755","pubdate":"2017-09-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"372","title":"Prevalence of K13 mutation and Day-3 positive parasitaemia in artemisinin-resistant malaria endemic area of Cambodia: a cross-sectional study","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-k13-mutation-day3-positive-parasitaemia-artemisininresistant-malaria-endemic-area-cambodi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":4.45,"6m":4.45,"3m":4.45,"1m":4.45,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":1786578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6624814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131248,"mean":11.799243350324,"rank":33262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":97714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131248,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2960,"mean":5.0783501182832,"rank":712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2960,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":5.3067012987013,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1,"TZ":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MalariaJournal\/statuses\/908018968710885376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25205351],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T17:26:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Malaria Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/694610748417392641\/ZYLOFbW5_normal.png","description":"Malaria Journal, published by @BioMedCentral, is an open access forum bringing together knowledge from all aspects of malarial research.","id_on_source":"MalariaJournal","tweeter_id":"1361693606","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2341},"tweet_id":"908018968710885376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UMDIGH\/statuses\/908034608738050048","license":"gnip","rt":["MalariaJournal"],"citation_ids":[25205351],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T18:28:15+00:00","author":{"name":"UM IGH","url":"http:\/\/www.medschool.umaryland.edu\/IGH\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/863123084353708032\/S1pdVbN3_normal.jpg","description":"The University of Maryland School of Medicine Institute for Global Health dedicated to fighting diseases around the world #malaria #vaccineswork #globalhealth","id_on_source":"UMDIGH","tweeter_id":"862401548047056900","geo":{"lt":39.29038,"ln":-76.61219,"country":"US"},"followers":886},"tweet_id":"908034608738050048"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/deusthindwa\/statuses\/908039007354925056","license":"gnip","rt":["MalariaJournal"],"citation_ids":[25205351],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T18:45:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Deus Thindwa","url":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4845-7862","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/892698638018912256\/kTtvW47L_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist.
