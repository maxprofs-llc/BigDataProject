Rigorous control of water balance and the maintenance of predialysis serum K and PO4 within normal limits were the main criteria for judging the adequacy of the treatment. The results regarding blood pressure, phosphate problems, haematocrit, peripheral nerve status, pericarditis and range of rehabilitation are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cde3","authors":["Cambi, V","Savazzi, G","Arisi, L","Bignardi, L","Bruschi, G","Rossi, E","Migone, L"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T19:22:04+00:00","issns":["0071-2736"],"journal":"Proceedings of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association","last_mentioned_on":1505330511,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1197243"],"pmid":"1197243","pubdate":"1975-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nephrology","generalsurgery","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Short dialysis schedules (SDS)--finally ready to become routine?","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":6381732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125769,"mean":11.709171553973,"rank":88035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125769,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.3,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/caioqualunque\/statuses\/908048094335467520","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25209171],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T19:21:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Fra Ian","url":"http:\/\/kidneydumb.blogspot.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900779066797813764\/QsBAX3-c_normal.jpg","description":"Francesco Iannuzzella, European of Italian nationality, Nephrologist, @ISNeducation Social Media Professional, \"Labor omnia vincit improbus\"","id_on_source":"caioqualunque","tweeter_id":"1332371461","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":990},"tweet_id":"908048094335467520"}]}}
