In this study, a new R2* model that simultaneously explains the effects of fiber orientation and myelin concentration is proposed and tested. In addition, a new approach that produces R2* maps without the effects of myelin is suggested. Experimental results demonstrate that the model reveals a high goodness of fit for the R2* distribution of white matter compared to a model that explains either fiber orientation or myelin concentration. The proposed R2* map shows a relatively uniform spatial distribution of R2* compared to the uncorrected R2* map and the fiber orientation or myelin concentration corrected R2* map.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Jingu Lee","Hyeong-Geol Shin","Woojin Jung","Yoonho Nam","Se-Hong Oh","Jongho Lee"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2017.08.050","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T16:33:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10538119"],"journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1505332932,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1053811917306973&_version=1&md5=c069739edbb3ec6af538fdee39794db9"],"pmid":"28823825","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"An R 2 * model of white matter for fiber orientation and myelin concentration","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/r-2-model-white-matter-fiber-orientation-myelin-concentration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":2.1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":3619116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4753317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125780,"mean":11.708212722315,"rank":47101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":77530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125780,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5699,"mean":8.3056388206388,"rank":3243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":2410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5699,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119,"mean":10.999610169492,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mripapers\/statuses\/908005758763069440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25203558],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T16:33:37+00:00","author":{"name":"MRI Papers","url":"http:\/\/mripapers.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/646060957777686528\/gbYC6GOS_normal.png","description":"Links to new articles from MRM, NMR in Biomedicine, Neuroimage, JCBFM and HBM.
