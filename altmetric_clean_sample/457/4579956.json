Pelvic tilt (PT), sacral slope (SS), pelvic incidence (PI), lumbar lordosis (LL), PI-LL, thoracic kyphosis (TK), T1 slope (T1S), cervical lordosis (CL), C7 sagittal vertical axis (C7 SVA), C2-7 SVA, and T1S-CL were measured using whole spine and pelvic radiographs taken in the standing position. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the EuroQOL (EQ-5D) standardized instrument for measurement of health outcome and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).\nThere were 36 subjects aged 50-59 years, 174 aged 60-69 years, 311 aged 70-79 years, and 135 aged 80-89 years. Average T1S for each decade was 32, 31, 33, and 36 degrees for males, and 28, 29, 32, and 37 degrees for females, respectively. Average C2-7 SVA was 25, 28, 34, and 35 mm for males, and 20, 21, 22, and 28 mm for females, respectively.C2-7 SVA \u2265 40 mm, T1S \u2265 40 degrees, and T1S-CL \u2265 20 degrees pertaining to EQ-5D were significantly worse in the other cases.\nC2-7 SVA was significantly greater in males among all age groups, particularly among those with C2-7 SVA of \u226540 mm [males, 69% (82\/118) vs. females, 33% (36\/118)]. Sagittal parameters of cervical spine were significantly worse in males than females. C2-7 SVA, T1S, and T1S-CL negatively influenced EQ-5D. These results help to explain the greater prevalence of cervical spondylotic myelopathy among elderly males.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a7","authors":["Oe, Shin","Togawa, Daisuke","Nakai, Keiichi","Yamada, Tomohiro","Arima, Hideyuki","Banno, Tomohiro","Yasuda, Tatsuya","Kobayasi, Sho","Yamato, Yu","Hasegawa, Tomohiko","Yoshida, Go","Matsuyama, Yukihiro"],"doi":"10.1097\/brs.0000000000001071","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T14:23:15+00:00","issns":["1528-1159","0362-2436"],"issue":"19","journal":"Spine","last_mentioned_on":1444251240,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/Abstract\/2015\/10010\/The_Influence_of_Age_and_Sex_on_Cervical_Spinal.5.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/spinejournal\/2015\/10010\/The_Influence_of_Age_and_Sex_on_Cervical_Spinal.5.pdf","pmid":"26208229","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1487","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"The Influence of Age and Sex on Cervical Spinal Alignment Among Volunteers Aged Over 50","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-age-sex-cervical-spinal-alignment-among-volunteers-aged-50"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6905205,"mean":6.1977133666125,"rank":3177886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3544690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6905205,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232293,"mean":9.255013190295,"rank":107775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":114357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232293,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4223,"mean":5.4866248223591,"rank":1911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4223,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":3.7776851851852,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":15,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"US":1,"AU":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpineWebJournal\/statuses\/651590951249408000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579956],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T02:52:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Spine","url":"http:\/\/spinejournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/761237931545677824\/JkWpUkYc_normal.jpg","description":"Spine is an international, peer-reviewed, bi-weekly periodical that considers for publication original articles in the field of spine.","id_on_source":"SpineWebJournal","tweeter_id":"314148293","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":2111},"tweet_id":"651590951249408000"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/scripe57\/statuses\/651597697883967488","license":"gnip","rt":["SpineWebJournal"],"citation_ids":[4579956],"posted_on":"2015-10-07T03:19:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Pirate...","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/steve-cripe-87b80a66","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/913052798220152833\/qe22kIuT_normal.jpg","description":"Former ED\/Trauma\/Neuro RN, EMT\/Paramedic\/FF; \nAlumnus of @shocktrauma et al.
