B-cell leukaemia\/lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax) functions as a pro-apoptotic factor and induces apoptosis in several organisms. The Bax-mediated apoptotic system is widely conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. In order to establish a tissue-specific cell death system in the domestic silkworm, Bombyx mori, we constructed a transgenic silkworm that overexpressed mouse Bax (mBax) in particular tissues by the Gal4-upstream activation sequence system. We found that the expression of mBax induced specific cell death in the silk gland, fat body and sensory cells. Fragmentation of genomic DNA was observed in the fat body, which expressed mBax, thereby supporting apoptotic cell death in this tissue. Using this system, we also demonstrated that specific cell death in sensory cells attenuated the response to the sex pheromone bombykol. These results show that we successfully established a tissue-specific cell death system in vivo that enabled specific deficiencies in particular tissues. The inducible cell death system may provide useful means for industrial applications of the silkworm and possible utilization for other species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae9","authors":["Sumitani, M","Sakurai, T","Kasashima, K","Kobayashi, S","Uchino, K","Kanzaki, R","Tamura, T","Sezutsu, H","Sumitani, M.","Sakurai, T.","Kasashima, K.","Kobayashi, S.","Uchino, K.","Kanzaki, R.","Tamura, T.","Sezutsu, H."],"doi":"10.1111\/imb.12192","endpage":"680","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T10:34:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2583"],"issue":"6","journal":"Insect Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1468080850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26426866?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/imb.12192\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/imb.12192\/pdf","pmid":"26426866","pubdate":"2015-10-02T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"671","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Establishment of a specific cell death induction system in Bombyx mori by a transgene with the conserved apoptotic regulator, mouse Bcl\u20102\u2010associated X protein (mouse Bax)","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-specific-cell-death-induction-system-bombyx-mori-transgene-conserved-apoptotic-regulat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.83,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037685,"mean":6.8229478924494,"rank":1066596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6969282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037685,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238320,"mean":9.5177962730627,"rank":40997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":197286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238320,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329,"mean":2.8605670731707,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.5735714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/649895147090501632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579153],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T10:34:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"649895147090501632"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fruitWormPapers\/statuses\/649968851350716417","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579153],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T15:27:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Fruit Worms","url":"http:\/\/fruit-worm-papers.tumblr.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/529745729099530240\/fNhHNBM4_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous, auto-updated feed of #Celegans (and other Caenorhabditeae) of fruit or wherever they may be -- PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and @PeerJ PrePrints.","id_on_source":"fruitWormPapers","tweeter_id":"2861324512","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":289},"tweet_id":"649968851350716417"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lepido_papers\/statuses\/751811692409987072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579153],"posted_on":"2016-07-09T16:14:10+00:00","author":{"name":"lepidopapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558930683972685824\/x5EhqwSQ_normal.jpeg","description":"Continuous feed for papers on Lepidoptera from PubMed.
