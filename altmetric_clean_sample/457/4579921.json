We recently found a direct correlation between MMP14 expression levels in brain tumors of glioma patients and the disease progression. By using gene silencing as an experimental approach we found that MMP14 knockdown decreases production of pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF and IL8 and thereby suppresses angiogenesis in glioma tumors. Although the clinical relevance of MMP14 down-regulation and its possible implications for glioma therapy in humans remain unclear, we observed a significant improvement in animal survival upon down-regulation of MMP14 in murine intracranial glioma xenografts infected with MMP14 shRNA-expressing CRAd. We further found that down-regulation of MMP14 in gliomas by combinational treatment with CRAd-S-5\/3 and Marimastat, a chemical inhibitor of metalloproteinases, augments suppression of pro-angiogenic factors, caused by the replication-competent adenovirus. We also demonstrated that delivery of MMP14-targeting shRNA by a fiber-modified adenoviral vector to the glioma cells effectively suppresses their proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Thus our data indicate that inhibition of MMP14 expression in tumors in combination with glioma virotherapy could be effectively utilized to suppress angiogenesis and neovascularization of glioma tumors by decreasing production of pro-angiogenic factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249e","authors":["Ulasov, Ilya","Borovjagin, Anton V","Kaverina, Natalya","Schroeder, Brett","Shah, Nameeta","Lin, Biaoyang","Baryshnikov, Anatoly","Cobbs, Charles"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.canlet.2015.06.002","endpage":"250","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T14:09:32+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1872-7980","03043835"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cancer Letters","last_mentioned_on":1443794957,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26052095?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26052095","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"240","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MT1-MMP silencing by a shRNA-armed glioma-targeted conditionally replicative adenovirus (CRAd) improves its anti-glioma efficacy in vitro and in vivo.","type":"article","volume":"365","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mt1mmp-silencing-shrnaarmed-gliomatargeted-conditionally-replicative-adenovirus-crad-improves-antigl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6420967,"mean":5.8847647033173,"rank":5468950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6420967,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201540,"mean":10.036149320975,"rank":160617,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201540,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1396,"mean":2.8212616487455,"rank":1039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1396,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.1296153846154,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
