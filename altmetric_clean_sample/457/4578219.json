Partner preferences of gay men and lesbians. - PubMed - NCBI GAYS LIKE MASCULINITY."],"citation":{"abstract":"On average, gay men are somewhat feminine and lesbians somewhat masculine, but there is variation within each group. The authors examined the consequences of this variation for gay men's and lesbians' desirability as romantic partners. In 2 studies the authors analyzed personal advertisements. Homosexual people were more likely than heterosexual people to mention traits related to sex typicality and more likely to request sex-typical than sex-atypical partners. In 2 studies the authors assessed partner preferences directly. On average, gay men preferred men who described themselves as masculine rather than feminine, but this preference was weaker among men who rated themselves as relatively feminine. Lesbians preferred women who described themselves as feminine looking but did not discriminate against women calling themselves masculine acting. The authors discuss implications of the results for theories of sexual orientation and the adjustment of sex-atypical homosexual people.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a6","authors":["Bailey, J M","Kim, P Y","Hills, A","Linsenmeier, J A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T04:58:49+00:00","issns":["0022-3514"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Personality & Social Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1443761912,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9364755"],"pmid":"9364755","pubdate":"1997-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Butch, femme, or straight acting?
