The regulation of important cellular processes and its link to cancer presented Src as an attractive target for MM. We suggest a novel strategy to improve the treatment of MM and overcome the drug resistance for the current therapeutic agents by specific inhibition of Src in MM cells by Tris (Dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Tris DBA). Tris DBA reduces proliferation, induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in MM cells. Tris DBA showed additive effect with proteasome inhibitors reducing proliferation, cell cycle signaling, and increasing apoptosis more than each drug alone. Tris DBA overcame hypoxia-induced effects such as enhanced chemotaxis or drug resistance to proteasome inhibitors by inhibition of HIF1\u03b1 expression. Moreover, we found that Tris DBA is an effective anti-myeloma agent alone or in combination with other targeted drugs and that it reverses hypoxia-induced drug resistance in myeloma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["de la Puente, Pilar","Azab, Feda","Muz, Barbara","Luderer, Micah","Arbiser, Jack","Azab, Abdel Kareem"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2015.1099645","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T12:22:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams"],"issns":["1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1447340857,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421357?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421357","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3109\/10428194.2015.1099645","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10428194.2015.1099645#.VkSqb1CVE9k.facebook"],"pmid":"26421357","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:00:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Tris DBA palladium overcomes hypoxia-mediated drug resistance in multiple myeloma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tris-dba-palladium-overcomes-hypoxiamediated-drug-resistance-multiple-myeloma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6562576,"mean":6.081396308004,"rank":3117785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1960295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6562576,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204526,"mean":10.092074572791,"rank":110482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":73531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204526,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":935,"mean":1.7490107066381,"rank":361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":935,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.82,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
