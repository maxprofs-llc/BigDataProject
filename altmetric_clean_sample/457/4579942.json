It was shown that rhamnose (0.8%), yeasts autolysate (0.2%), temperature of the cultivation 25 degrees C, pH 5.0 are necessary for maximal \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase production. The enzyme reaches the maximal activity level in 96 hours with sulphitic number equal 0.44. At cultivation of P. tardum in the picked up conditions the \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase synthesis has raised in 4 times.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce4e","authors":["Gudsenko, O V","Varbanets, L D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T14:16:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1028-0987"],"issue":"4","journal":"Mikrobiolohichny\u012d zhurnal Mikrobiologichny zhurnal","last_mentioned_on":1444768978,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26422921?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26422921","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"[OPTIMIZATION OF CULTIVATION CONDITIONS OF PENICILLIUM TARDUM--THE \u03b1-L- RHAMNOSIDASE PRODUCER].","type":"article","volume":"77"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237522,"mean":5.9780720020044,"rank":2907738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3305880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237522,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190661,"mean":10.313559362216,"rank":100079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":89388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190661,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.60555555555556,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.61111111111111,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/statuses\/649951013906964480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579942],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T14:16:11+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
