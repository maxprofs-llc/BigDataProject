Dose- and time-dependent reductions in cell numbers were seen, plus an increase in the proportion of cells in the S phase. The DNA content was reduced in the treated cells, and BrdU incorporation diminished. However, neither ammonia nor ammonia plus glutamine had any effect on DNA polymerase activity. iTRAQ analysis showed that exposure to ammonia induced a significant reduction in histone and heterochromatin protein 1 expression. A reduction in cell viability was also noted. The ammonia-induced reduction of proliferative activity in these cultured astroglial cells seems to be due to a delay in the completion of the S phase provoked by the inhibition of chromatin protein synthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Guillermo Bodega","Berta Segura","Sergio Ciordia","Mar\u00eda del Carmen Mena","Luis Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez-Fern\u00e1ndez","Mar\u00eda Isabel Garc\u00eda","Isabel Trabado","Isabel Su\u00e1rez"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0139619","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T18:59:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1443698705,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0139619","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421615?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0139619.PDF","pmid":"26421615","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0139619","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Ammonia Affects Astroglial Proliferation in Culture.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ammonia-affects-astroglial-proliferation-culture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242881,"mean":5.9844489902114,"rank":4616767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":936949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242881,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190379,"mean":10.296074189245,"rank":129483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":40534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190379,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98354,"mean":9.7721199150001,"rank":71783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":15735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98354,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5796,"mean":8.8501625539258,"rank":4221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5796,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
