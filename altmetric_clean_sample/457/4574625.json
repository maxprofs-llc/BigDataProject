Studies of aging-related changes in human B cell repertoires have benefited from the ability to detect and quantify thousands to millions of B cell clones in human samples, and study the mutational lineages and isotype switching relationships within each clonal lineage. Correlation of repertoire analysis with antibody gene data from antigen-specific B cells is poised to give much greater insight into clinically relevant B cell responses and memory storage. Here, we describe strategies for preparing and analyzing human antibody gene libraries for studying B cell repertoires.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd3b","authors":["Wang, Chen","Liu, Yi","Roskin, Krishna M","Jackson, Katherine J L","Boyd, Scott D"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2963-4_17","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T10:25:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1940-6029"],"journal":"Methods in molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1467367813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26420720?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26420720","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:00:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Laboratory and Data Analysis Methods for Characterization of Human B Cell Repertoires by High-Throughput DNA Sequencing.","type":"article","volume":"1343","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laboratory-data-analysis-methods-characterization-human-b-cell-repertoires-highthroughput-dna-sequen-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":6044962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1073828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237150,"mean":9.418033261789,"rank":163634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237150,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5640,"mean":1.8970345805994,"rank":2949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5640,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":1.3802846441948,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CompBiolPapers\/statuses\/649530589557616640","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4574625],"posted_on":"2015-10-01T10:25:34+00:00","author":{"name":"CompBiolPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/848199297611026432\/GiXZ3YhG_normal.jpg","description":"Feed for sequencing papers","id_on_source":"CompBiolPapers","tweeter_id":"2365948482","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":697},"tweet_id":"649530589557616640"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/iRecRepPapers\/statuses\/748820998846160896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4574625],"posted_on":"2016-07-01T10:10:13+00:00","author":{"name":"RepSeqPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/698033041839554560\/2Lqbb8C9_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for papers on immune receptor repertoires.
