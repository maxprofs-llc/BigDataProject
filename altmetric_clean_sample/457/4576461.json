We aimed to understand how African American adults and adolescents conceptualize cardiovascular health and perceive related barriers and facilitators.\nThis qualitative study was conducted as formative research for a larger study, Heart Healthy Lenoir, which aimed to reduce cardiovascular disease disparities among African Americans in eastern North Carolina, part of the widely-known \"stroke belt\" that runs through the southeastern United States. Using photovoice, a community-based participatory research method, we conducted eight 90-minute photovoice sessions with 6 adults and 9 adolescents in Lenoir County, North Carolina. Topics for each discussion were selected by participants and reflected themes related to cardiovascular health promotion. All sessions were transcribed and coded using a data-driven, inductive approach.\nParticipants conceptualized cardiovascular health to have mental, spiritual, and social health dimensions. Given these broad domains, participants acknowledged many ecological barriers to cardiovascular health; however, they also emphasized the importance of personal responsibility. Facilitators for cardiovascular health included using social health (eg, family\/community relationships) and spiritual health dimensions (eg, understanding one's body and purpose) to improve health behaviors.\nThe perspectives of African American adults and adolescents elicited through this formative research provided a strong foundation for Heart Healthy Lenoir's ongoing engagement of community members in Lenoir County and development and implementation of its intervention to prevent cardiovascular disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085b9","authors":["Sarah Kowitt"],"doi":"10.5888\/pcd12.150062","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T17:16:22+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","phs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1545-1151"],"journal":"Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health Research, Practice and Policy","last_mentioned_on":1466602279,"links":["http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/pcd\/issues\/2015\/15_0062.htm","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5888\/pcd12.150062","http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/pcd\/issues\/2015\/15_0062.htm?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26425868","pubdate":"2015-10-01T20:15:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Using Photovoice to Understand Barriers to and Facilitators of Cardiovascular Health Among African American Adults and Adolescents, North Carolina, 2011\u20132012","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-photovoice-understand-barriers-facilitators-cardiovascular-health-among-african-american-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":44.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":44.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7931561,"mean":6.7081498191978,"rank":187494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7744011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7931561,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236789,"mean":9.4119397013362,"rank":9827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":226956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236789,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1010,"mean":19.324763131814,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1010,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":22.482,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
