At times, it is difficult and takes longer time or has to be converted to an open procedure. This study is undertaken to determine the predictive factors for difficult LC.\nThe aim was to evaluate a scoring method to predict difficult LC preoperatively.\nThere were 30 cases operated by a single experienced surgeon. There are total 15 score from history, clinical and sonological findings. Score up to 5 predicted easy, 6-10 difficult and >10 are very difficult.\nPrediction came true in 76.4% for easy and 100% difficult cases; there were no cases with a score above 10. The factors like previous history of hospitalization (P - 0.004), clinically palpable gallbladder (GB) (P - 0.009), impacted GB stone (P - 0.001), pericholecystic collection (P - 0.04), and abdominal scar due to previous abdominal surgery (P - 0.009) were found statistically significant in predicting difficult LC.\nThe proposed scoring system is reliable with a sensitivity of 76.47% and specificity of 100%.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef472a83ee09648b4734","authors":["Agrawal, Nikhil","Singh, Sumitoj","Khichy, Sudhir"],"doi":"10.4103\/1117-6806.162567","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T10:22:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1117-6806"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nigerian Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1443781324,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26425067?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26425067","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Preoperative Prediction of Difficult Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: A Scoring Method.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-prediction-difficult-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":5470708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201542,"mean":10.037467651743,"rank":160614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201542,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.1941666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
