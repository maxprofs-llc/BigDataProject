To determine if antiresorptive bisphosphonates could improve bone quality and their effects on muscle we studied the Mdx mouse, treated with pamidronate during peak bone growth at 5 and 6 weeks of age, and examined the outcome at 13 weeks of age. Pamidronate increased cortical bone architecture and strength in femurs with increased resistance to fracture. While overall long bone growth was not affected by pamidronate, there was significant inhibition of remodeling in metaphyseal trabecular bone with evidence of residual calcified cartilage. Pamidronate treatment had positive effects on skeletal muscle in the Mdx mice with decreased serum and muscle creatine kinase and evidence of improved muscle histology and grip strength.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319b","authors":["Yoon, Sung-Hee","Sugamori, Kim S","Grynpas, Marc D","Mitchell, Jane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nmd.2015.09.015","endpage":"84","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T10:30:43+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["0960-8966","1873-2364","09608966"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neuromuscular Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1443695422,"links":["http:\/\/www.nmd-journal.com\/article\/S0960-8966(15)00742-7\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494410?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nmd-journal.com\/article\/S0960896615007427\/pdf","pmid":"26494410","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"73","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Positive effects of bisphosphonates on bone and muscle in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/positive-effects-bisphosphonates-bone-muscle-mouse-model-duchenne-muscular-dystrophy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088333,"mean":6.8694302580481,"rank":7001450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088333,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237897,"mean":9.5319113814439,"rank":197792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237897,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":823,"mean":1.8354282238443,"rank":600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":823,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.9014285714286,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":2,"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NatRevNeurol\/statuses\/649531796766502912","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4574676],"posted_on":"2015-10-01T10:30:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Nat Rev Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrneurol\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1629167444\/nrneurol_Twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Nature Reviews Neurology is a clinical review journal from Nature Publishing Group.
