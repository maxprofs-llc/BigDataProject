Occasionally, these tumors metastasize to the brain, warranting biopsy or resection. In these surgical patients, the perioperative implications for anesthetic management are not heretofore defined in the indexed literature.\nPatients who had craniotomy for biopsy or resection of intracranial carcinoid tumors were retrospectively identified at a single medical center. Patient demographics, perioperative anesthetic management, adverse events, and outcome were summarized in this case series.\nEleven patients were identified; median age was 60 years (range = 42-78 years), and 45% were male. Immediately before surgery, 4 patients (36%) were receiving a somatostatin analog drug, and no patient had unchecked carcinoid syndrome. All patients received general anesthesia that included inhaled isoflurane and nitrous oxide, and all had invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring. One patient developed sustained hypotension after induction of anesthesia, likely related to hypovolemia and anesthetic drugs, but the possibility of carcinoid mediator release cannot be excluded. There were no other signs or symptoms of carcinoid syndrome in this or any other patient. Of all 11 patients, 10 (91%) experienced either significant disease progression (n = 2; 18%) or death (n = 8; 73%) from carcinoid disease, its sequelae, or an undetermined cause within 3 years after surgery. Of note, 3 of the deaths occurred shortly after surgery, on postoperative days 3, 7, and 8.\nIn our experience, carcinoid tumor metastasis to the brain-whether because of tumor makeup or prior treatment-is unlikely to produce symptoms of new-onset carcinoid syndrome intraoperatively; however, the risk cannot be completely excluded. Postsurgical prognosis was poor, both within the hospital and after hospital discharge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfc","authors":["Welch, Tasha L","Pasternak, Jeffrey J","Lanier, William L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jclinane.2015.08.014","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T10:16:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4529","09528180"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1443694543,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26422777?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0952818015002639&_version=1&md5=fd83b1af4243f1108c4114483bc982bd"],"pmid":"26422777","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Anesthetic management of patients undergoing resection of carcinoid metastasis to the brain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anesthetic-management-patients-undergoing-resection-carcinoid-metastasis-brain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":5470764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201222,"mean":10.018750696995,"rank":160372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201222,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":762,"mean":1.2274875164258,"rank":389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":762,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":0.99772727272727,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
