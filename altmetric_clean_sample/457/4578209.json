Trials have established the usefulness of antiangiogenic agents and new regimens in prolonging survival in patients with advanced disease. In the United States, the antiangiogenic agents approved for treating metastatic CRC often are combined with traditional chemotherapeutic agents and include bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae), ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap\u00ae), and regorafenib (Stivarga\u00ae).\nThis article reviews factors that guide the development of a nursing plan for monitoring and managing patients who are receiving antiangiogenic therapies.\nRegorafenib and ziv-aflibercept, two newer agents that nurses and other healthcare professionals may have had less experience with, were reviewed.\nThe key to maximizing the potential benefit of these agents is understanding where these new therapies fit in the overall scheme of treatment options and how to help patients tolerate treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255f","authors":["McIntyre, Keith"],"doi":"10.1188\/15.cjon.571-579","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T04:53:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1538-067X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1443761566,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26414575?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1188\/15.CJON.571-579"],"pmid":"26414575","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","neoplasms"],"title":"An Oncology Nurses' Guide to New Targeted Agents for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oncology-nurses-guide-new-targeted-agents-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":4745252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":951684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201542,"mean":10.03747955999,"rank":138449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201542,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":2.1520215827338,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1272727272727,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/darmtag\/statuses\/649809225602875392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4578209],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T04:52:46+00:00","author":{"name":"Darmtag","url":"http:\/\/darmtag.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000860007151\/bUdy376d_normal.png","id_on_source":"darmtag","tweeter_id":"580627607","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":13.41667,"country":"DE"},"followers":45},"tweet_id":"649809225602875392"}],"facebook":[{"title":"An Oncology Nurses' Guide to New Targeted Agents for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1057739240926383&id=409732015727112","license":"public","citation_ids":[4578209],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T04:52:45+00:00","summary":"Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2015 Oct 1;19(5):571-9. doi: 10.1188\/15.CJON.571-579.","author":{"name":"Berlin Brandenburger Darmtag","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/409732015727112","facebook_wall_name":"Berlin Brandenburger Darmtag","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/409732015727112\/picture","id_on_source":"409732015727112"}}]}}
