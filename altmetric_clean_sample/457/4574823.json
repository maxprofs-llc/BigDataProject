Metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies are therefore necessary to understand the pharmacological mechanisms of polyphenols. Jumihaidokuto (JHT), a traditional Japanese medicine, has been used for treatment of skin diseases including inflammatory acne. Because JHT contains various types of bioactive polyphenols, our aim was to clarify the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the polyphenols in JHT and identify active metabolites contributing to its antidermatitis effects. Orally administered JHT inhibited the increase in ear thickness in rats induced by intradermal injection of Propionibacterium acnes. Quantification by LC-MS\/MS indicated that JHT contains various types of flavonoids and is also rich in hydrolysable tannins, such as 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl glucose. Pharmacokinetic and antioxidant analyses showed that some flavonoid conjugates, such as genistein 7-O-glucuronide and liquiritigenin 7-O-glucuronide, appeared in rat plasma and had an activity to inhibit hydrogen peroxide-dependent oxidation. Furthermore, 4-O-methylgallic acid, a metabolite of Gallic acid, appeared in rat plasma and inhibited the nitric oxide reaction. JHT has numerous polyphenols; it inhibited dermatitis probably via the antioxidant effect of its metabolites. Our study is beneficial for understanding in vivo actions of orally administered polyphenol drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Takashi Matsumoto"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules201018031","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T10:57:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1444205486,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/10\/18031","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26437394?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/20\/10\/18031\/pdf","pmid":"26437394","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Plasma Pharmacokinetics of Polyphenols in a Traditional Japanese Medicine, Jumihaidokuto, Which Suppresses Propionibacterium acnes-Induced Dermatitis in Rats","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-pharmacokinetics-polyphenols-traditional-japanese-medicine-jumihaidokuto-suppresses-propionib"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6297749,"mean":5.9484128043877,"rank":2966388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1877849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6297749,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197861,"mean":10.124617972304,"rank":106342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":71419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197861,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2561,"mean":1.98835390625,"rank":717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2561,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.0972967032967,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
