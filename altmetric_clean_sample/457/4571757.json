In this study, we examined the clinical and histological features of a contemporary series of malignant colorectal polyps (MCPs) with subsequent surgical resection.\nWe conducted a retrospective study on a consecutive series of MCPs from 239 patients, predominantly males (57.7%) with a median age of 66\u2005years, and assessed histological parameters associated with residual disease on the surgical specimens.\nMedian MCP size was 18.6\u2005mm, with 23.1% polyps measuring \u226410\u2005mm. From the 140 surgical resection specimens, residual disease was identified in 20 cases, including 12 cases with metastatic lymph nodes and\/or 9 cases with residual carcinoma in the large bowel wall. Histological parameters associated with nodal metastases were greater width and greater depth of the invasive component (p=0.001 and 0.006, respectively), poor differentiation (p=0.003) and a cribriform pattern (p=0.01). The risk of nodal metastases was 23.3% if two or three of these features were identified, while it was 0% and 4.5% if none or one was present, respectively. A positive margin was not associated with nodal metastasis and might be adequately treated by local endoscopic resection.\nSurgical resection should be recommended if \u22652 of these adverse histological features are present and may be warranted if one feature is present. A positive margin may require additional local resection but not necessarily surgery if no other adverse factors are present.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["Ian S Brown","Mark L Bettington","Andrew Bettington","Gregory Miller","Christophe Rosty","Brown, Ian S","Bettington, Mark L","Bettington, Andrew","Miller, Gregory","Rosty, Christophe"],"doi":"10.1136\/jclinpath-2015-203203","endpage":"299","first_seen_on":"2015-09-30T17:53:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-4146","0021-9746"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1461191947,"links":["http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/30\/jclinpath-2015-203203.short?rss=1","http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/30\/jclinpath-2015-203203.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26424814?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/69\/4\/292.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/69\/4\/292.full","http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/69\/4\/292.full.pdf%20html","http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/69\/4\/292.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/09\/30\/jclinpath-2015-203203.full.pdf","pmid":"26424814","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Association of Clinical Pathologists","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jclinpath-2015-203203","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Adverse histological features in malignant colorectal polyps: a contemporary series of 239 cases.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jcp.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/jclinpath-2015-203203","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adverse-histological-features-malignant-colorectal-polyps-contemporary-series-239-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8258564,"mean":6.9741565882523,"rank":1525426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6727282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8258564,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238757,"mean":9.5691519710499,"rank":51607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":186898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238757,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1858,"mean":4.3253828756058,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":1661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1858,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":3.6775,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
