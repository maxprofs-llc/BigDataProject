Rad53 phosphorylates nuclear pores to counteract gene gating, thus preventing aberrant transitions at forks approaching transcribed genes. Here, we show that Rrm3 and Pif1, DNA helicases assisting fork progression across pausing sites, are detrimental in rad53 mutants experiencing replication stress. Rrm3 and Pif1 ablations rescue cell lethality, chromosome fragmentation, replisome-fork dissociation, fork reversal, and processing in\u00a0rad53 cells. Through phosphorylation, Rad53 regulates Rrm3 and Pif1; phospho-mimicking rrm3 mutants ameliorate rad53 phenotypes following replication stress without affecting replication across pausing elements under normal conditions. Hence, the Mec1-Rad53 axis protects fork stability by regulating nuclear pores and DNA helicases. We propose that following replication stress, forks stall in an asymmetric conformation by inhibiting Rrm3 and Pif1, thus impeding lagging strand extension and preventing fork reversal; conversely, under unperturbed conditions, the peculiar conformation of forks encountering pausing sites would depend on active Rrm3 and Pif1.","altmetric_jid":"52d545303cf058dd068b4567","authors":["Rossi, Silvia Emma","Ajazi, Arta","Carotenuto, Walter","Foiani, Marco","Giannattasio, Michele"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.celrep.2015.08.073","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T21:25:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2211-1247","22111247"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cell Reports","last_mentioned_on":1468442549,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cell-reports\/abstract\/S2211-1247(15)00986-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26411679?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S2211124715009869\/pdf","pmid":"26411679","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Rad53-Mediated Regulation of Rrm3 and Pif1 DNA Helicases Contributes to Prevention of Aberrant Fork Transitions under Replication Stress","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rad53mediated-regulation-rrm3-pif1-dna-helicases-contributes-prevention-aberrant-fork-transitions-un"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":5845601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1940398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237790,"mean":9.5292631787002,"rank":148690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":73571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237790,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3790,"mean":22.2384016891,"rank":3475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3790,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":17.722354978355,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
