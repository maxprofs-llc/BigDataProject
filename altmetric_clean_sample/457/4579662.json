Inclusion criteria were preoperative ERG, at least 6 months of follow-up postphacoemulsification, and the absence of preexisting RD as determined by ophthalmic examination and\/or ultrasound. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-squared test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Wilson confidence intervals with the P-value <0.05 were considered significant.\nPhacoemulsification was performed without retinopexy in 79 eyes (42 dogs, non-PR group) and with prophylactic retinopexy in 23 eyes (12 dogs, PR group). Incidence of diabetes mellitus was 10\/42 and 3\/12 in the non-PR and the PR groups, respectively (P = 0.93). Intraocular lens implantation was performed in 40\/42 non-PR dogs and 11\/12 PR dogs (P = 0.63, 73\/79 vs. 21\/23 eyes). At final re-examination, RD occurred in 4\/79 eyes without retinopexy, compared to 0\/23 RD in the retinopexy group. There was no statistically significant difference in RD rates between the two groups (P = 0.27).\nThese data provide no statistical evidence to support prophylactic retinopexy in Bichon Frises. Due to the low rate of retinal detachment following phacoemulsification without prophylactic retinopexy, the procedure appears to offer limited benefit to offset cost, procedural risk, and risk of extended or repeated anesthesia in Bichon Frises.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fc","authors":["Pryor, Silvia G.","Bentley, Ellison","McLellan, Gillian J.","Giuliano, Elizabeth A.","Albaugh, Rachel A.","Rankin, Amy J.","Labelle, Amber L.","Buhr, Kevin A.","Allbaugh, Rachel A."],"doi":"10.1111\/vop.12310","endpage":"378","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T12:47:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1463-5224"],"issue":"5","journal":"Veterinary Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1443817022,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/vop.12310","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12310\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vop.12310\/pdf","pmid":"26429670","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"373","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Retinal detachment postphacoemulsification in Bichon Frises: a retrospective study of 54 dogs","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retinal-detachment-postphacoemulsification-bichon-frises-retrospective-study-54-dogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6425095,"mean":5.9896225455997,"rank":4752333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949789,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6425095,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196580,"mean":10.140224327115,"rank":133899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":40826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196580,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":1.513338028169,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.8041666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":10}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/649928532987088896","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4579662],"posted_on":"2015-10-02T12:46:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
