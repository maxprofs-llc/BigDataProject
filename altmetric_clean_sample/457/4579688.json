Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction is likely to proceed through alkoxylcarbonyl palladation of the allene followed by an amination process. The synthetic utility of the protocol is showcased in the asymmetric construction of a cycloheptene-fused chiral \u03b2-lactam.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Jiawang Liu"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.5b07764","first_seen_on":"2015-10-02T12:54:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1443789000,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jacs.5b07764"],"pmid":"26376845","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Highly Regio- and Enantioselective Alkoxycarbonylative Amination of Terminal Allenes Catalyzed by a Spiroketal-Based Diphosphine\/Pd(II) Complex","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-regio-enantioselective-alkoxycarbonylative-amination-terminal-allenes-catalyzed-spiroketalbas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":994295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5427383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201542,"mean":10.037474598221,"rank":44544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":156988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201542,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16290,"mean":4.868475781202,"rank":3584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":12564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16290,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":7.4569452736318,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
