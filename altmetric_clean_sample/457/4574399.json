The effects of this heptapeptide on the IFN-\u03b1-sensitive CML cells were investigated in the present study. IFN-\u03b1-sensitive KT-1\/A3 and IFN-\u03b1-resistant KT-1\/A3R CML cells were transfected by pEGFP-KLWVIPQ expression vector and\/or induced by IFN-\u03b1. WST-1 cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, and western blotting were performed to determine the effects of this heptapeptide and\/or IFN-\u03b1 on CML cells. The viability of the KT-1\/A3 cells was inhibited and apoptosis was induced by either expression of the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ or IFN-\u03b1 treatment with concurrent upregulation of P53 and downregulation of P210(bcr\/abl). However, these effects were not observed in the IFN-\u03b1-resistant KT-1\/A3R cells. These results suggest that the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ shares a similar mechanism with IFN-\u03b1 in the regulation of CML cell growth and apoptosis, implying that the heptapeptide KLWVIPQ could be a novel target to go further into mechanisms of IFN-\u03b1 sensitivity and\/or resistance in CML.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Yang, Fu-Lan","Chen, Fang-Zhi","Wan, Xin-Xing","Zhou, Xi","Zhou, Mei-Juan","Chen, Han-Chun","Fu, Jun-Jiang","Zhang, Dian-Zheng"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/325026","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T10:13:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1443694413,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421285?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26421285","pubdate":"2015-10-01T22:00:46+00:00","title":"Effects of a Particular Heptapeptide on the IFN-\u03b1-Sensitive CML Cells.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-particular-heptapeptide-ifn%CE%B1sensitive-cml-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":3028129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1925213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201222,"mean":10.018748212165,"rank":108379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201222,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3743,"mean":2.6217749866382,"rank":1305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3743,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":2.7093241758242,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
