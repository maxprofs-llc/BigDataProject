To assess whether toxic effects of malathion are driven primarily by exposure concentration or exposure duration, Daphnia magna was pulse exposed to equivalent integrated doses (duration x concentration), i.e. 3h x 16\u2009\u00b5g\/L, 24h x 2\u2009\u00b5g\/L and 48h x 1\u2009\u00b5g\/L. Following recovery periods of 3h, 24h and 48h the toxicity of malathion on different biological levels in Daphnia magna was examined by analyzing the following endpoints: survival and immobilization; enzyme activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CbE), and glutathione S-transferase (GST); and AChE gene expression. The results showed no difference in survival among equivalent integrated doses. Adverse sub-lethal effects were driven by exposure concentration rather than pulseduration. Specifically, short pulse exposure to a high concentration of malathion resulted in more immobilized daphnids, lower AChE and CbE activities and a higher transcript level of AChE gene compared to long pulse exposure to low concentration. The expression of the AChE gene was up-regulated, indicating a compensatory mechanism to cope with enzyme inhibition. The study shows the need for obtaining a better understanding of the processes underlying toxicity under realistic exposure scenarios, so this can be taken into account in environmental risk assessment of pesticides.
