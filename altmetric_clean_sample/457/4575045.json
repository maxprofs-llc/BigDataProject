They were tested in A. odoratissimus (terap) and A. altilis and evaluated in silico for two congeners.\nFifteen simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in chloroplast sequences from four Artocarpus transcriptome assemblies. The markers were evaluated using capillary electrophoresis in A. odoratissimus (105 accessions) and A. altilis (73). They were also evaluated in silico in A. altilis (10), A. camansi (6), and A. altilis \u00d7 A. mariannensis (7) transcriptomes. All loci were polymorphic in at least one species, with all 15 polymorphic in A. camansi. Per species, average alleles per locus ranged between 2.2 and 2.5. Three loci had evidence of fragment-length homoplasy.\nThese markers will complement existing nuclear markers by enabling confident identification of maternal and clone lines, which are often important in vegetatively propagated crops such as breadfruit.","altmetric_jid":"554b867b2a83ee864e8b45a0","authors":["Gardner, Elliot M","Laricchia, Kristen M","Murphy, Matthew","Ragone, Diane","Scheffler, Brian E","Simpson, Sheron","Williams, Evelyn W","Zerega, Nyree J C"],"doi":"10.3732\/apps.1500049","first_seen_on":"2015-10-01T12:00:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2168-0450"],"issue":"9","journal":"Applications in Plant Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1443700823,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26421253"],"pmid":"26421253","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Chloroplast microsatellite markers for Artocarpus (Moraceae) developed from transcriptome sequences.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chloroplast-microsatellite-markers-iartocarpusi-moraceae-developed-transcriptome-sequences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":3028114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1925221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201222,"mean":10.018750696995,"rank":108378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201222,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168,"mean":12.439137724551,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":11.9124,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
