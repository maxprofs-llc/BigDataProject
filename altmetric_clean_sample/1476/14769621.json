Current real-world management is largely pharmacologic, despite poor risk\/benefit. The WeCareAdvisor was designed to enable family caregivers to assess, manage, and track BPSD using nonpharmacologic strategies.\nIn-depth qualitative data were collected from family caregivers of people with dementia to inform: (1) style of approach and \"look and feel\" of the tool, and (2) the types of psychoeducation most needed by caregivers.\nWe conducted 4 focus groups and a technology survey (n=26) as well as additional individual semistructured interviews (n=12) with family caregivers. Main themes of the qualitative work included: (1) need to minimize difficulty and training time; (2) importance of \"one-stop shopping\" for information; and (3) necessity for information to be tailored to the caregiver and person with dementia. This information was then combined with effective existing evidence-based behavioral strategies to create a web-based tailored caregiver-support tool.\nThe WeCareAdvisor was designed with input on functionality and content by end-users, family caregivers. The randomized controlled trial of WeCareAdvisor will test whether the tool improves outcomes including caregiver upset and burden and frequency and severity of BPSD.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
