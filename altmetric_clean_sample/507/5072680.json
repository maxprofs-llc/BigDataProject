Despite the uncertainty regarding this diagnosis, the inclusion of a probable diagnosis entity in this manual may aid in the accurate classification of headache disorders and allow effective treatment strategies to be started at the patient's initial visit.\nThis cross-sectional multicenter registry study assessed first-visit patients with complaints of headaches who presented at the outpatient clinics of 11 neurologists in Korea. The classification of a headache disorder was made according to the criteria of the ICHD-3\u03b2 by each investigator based on the initial evaluation of the patient or by a consensus meeting for uncertain cases. The rates of a probable diagnosis among PPHD patients were assessed and the clinical characteristics of these patients were compared with those of patients with a diagnosis of definite primary headache disorder (DPHD).\nA total of 1429 patients were diagnosed with PHD, and 305 (21.3%) of these patients had PPHD. The proportions of PPHD differed among the subtypes of DPHD as follows: migraines (16.1%), tension-type headaches (TTH; 33%), trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC; 40.9%), and other PHD (14%, P\u2009<\u2009.001). Patients with PPHD had less severe headache intensity than patients with DPHD (5.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 vs 6.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, respectively, P\u2009<\u2009.001) as well as a shorter duration of headache from onset (median: 1 vs 4 months, respectively, P\u2009<\u2009.001). The most common criteria missing for a definite diagnosis in the PPHD patients were total frequency (52.1%), duration of attack (14.4%), and accompanying symptoms (13.1%).\nA probable diagnosis was given to 21.3% of the first-visit PHD patients due to incomplete or atypical presentations of the headaches. The incorporation of a probable diagnosis into the ICHD-3\u03b2 may be useful for reducing the diagnoses of unspecified headaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b5","authors":["Kim, Soo\u2010Kyoung","Moon, Heui\u2010Soo","Cha, Myong\u2010Jin","Kim, Byung\u2010Su","Kim, Byung\u2010Kun","Park, Jeong\u2010Wook","Park, Kwang\u2010Yeol","Sohn, Jong\u2010Hee","Chu, Min\u2010Kyung","Song, Tae\u2010Jin","Kim, Jae\u2010Moon","Cho, Soo\u2010Jin","Kim, Soo-Kyoung","Moon, Heui-Soo","Cha, Myong-Jin","Kim, Byung-Su","Kim, Byung-Kun","Park, Jeong-Wook","Park, Kwang-Yeol","Sohn, Jong-Hee","Chu, Min-Kyung","Song, Tae-Jin","Kim, Jae-Moon","Cho, Soo-Jin"],"doi":"10.1111\/head.12742","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T20:25:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1526-4610"],"issue":"2","journal":"Headache: The Journal of Head & Face Pain","last_mentioned_on":1454655636,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/head.12742\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/head.12742\/pdf","pmid":"26832954","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Prevalence and Features of a Probable Diagnosis in First\u2010Visit Headache Patients Based on the Criteria of the Third Beta Edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders: A Prospective, Cross\u2010Sectional Multicenter Study","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-features-probable-diagnosis-firstvisit-headache-patients-based-criteria-third-beta-editio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7103144,"mean":6.3016585108842,"rank":1422988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5673526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7103144,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320744,"mean":9.3513659097779,"rank":80557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":239694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320744,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1514,"mean":6.8595082617317,"rank":502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1514,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":15.000204081633,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
