The principles underlying the techniques for evaluating toxicity to BM progenitors (erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid) exploit changes in the normal hematopoietic process, biochemical cell surface and intracellular markers, as well as components of the BM microenvironment. Toxicological investigations following in vivo exposures of mice or in vitro exposures of mouse primary BM cell cultures allow the assessment of the developmental and functional integrity of BM cells, cell population shifts, and adverse biochemical effects due to toxicity. Colony forming unit (CFU) assays and flow cytometry are indispensable techniques in these toxicity studies. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d9b2","authors":["Ezeh, Peace C","Xu, Huan","Wang, Shu Chun","Medina, Sebastian","Burchiel, Scott W"],"doi":"10.1002\/0471140856.tx1809s67","first_seen_on":"2016-02-02T11:50:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1934-9262"],"journal":"Current protocols in toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1454413806,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26828331?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26828331","pubdate":"2016-02-02T22:00:39+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Evaluation of Toxicity in Mouse Bone Marrow Progenitor Cells.","type":"article","volume":"67"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7084078,"mean":6.2895256542212,"rank":6092646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7084078,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320255,"mean":9.3667708256569,"rank":264274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320255,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.2189655172414,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HSC_papers\/statuses\/694487955897856000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5076842],"posted_on":"2016-02-02T11:50:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Hematopoiesis","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/618441198634561537\/Y2u99HYj_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"HSC_papers","tweeter_id":"3271095818","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":82},"tweet_id":"694487955897856000"}]}}
