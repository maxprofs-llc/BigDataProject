In this work, pretreatment of the peels to remove limonene under mild condition was proposed by leaching of limonene using hexane as solvent. The pretreatments were carried out with homogenized or chopped orange peel at 20-40\u00b0C with orange peel waste and hexane ratio (w\/v) ranging from 1\u2009:\u20092 to 1\u2009:\u200912 for 10 to 300\u2009min. The pretreated peels were then digested in batch reactors for 33 days. The highest biogas production was achieved by treating chopped orange peel waste and hexane ratio of 12\u2009:\u20091 at 20\u00b0C for 10\u2009min corresponding to more than threefold increase of biogas production from 0.061 to 0.217\u2009m(3) methane\/kg\u2009VS. The solvent recovery was 90% using vacuum filtration and needs further separation using evaporation. The hexane residue in the peel had a negative impact on biogas production as shown by 28.6% reduction of methane and lower methane production of pretreated orange peel waste in semicontinuous digestion system compared to that of untreated peel.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Wikandari, Rachma"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/494182","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T18:23:04+00:00","issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1454310060,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2015\/494182\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2015\/494182.pdf","pmid":"25866787","pubdate":"2015-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Improvement of Biogas Production from Orange Peel Waste by Leaching of Limonene","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improvement-biogas-production-orange-peel-waste-leaching-limonene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7069916,"mean":6.2881480770247,"rank":750762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6283303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7069916,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320413,"mean":9.3460542239364,"rank":47332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":272507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320413,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3892,"mean":2.7382508352609,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3892,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":1.6035866666667,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
