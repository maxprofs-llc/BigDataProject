On the basis of both intensity and timing of stimulus, it has been hypothesized that exposure to commensal microflora may represent another key protective modulator of immunity against atopy and subsequent atopic diseases.\nWe sought to investigate whether differences in early gut microflora precede the later development of atopic sensitization.\nIntestinal microflora from 76 infants at high risk of atopic diseases were analyzed at 3 weeks and 3 months of age by using conventional bacterial cultivation and 2 culture-independent methods, gas-liquid chromatography of bacterial cellular fatty acids and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization of bacterial cells. Infants evincing at least one positive skin prick reaction at 12 months were grouped as atopic subjects, and those without positive reactions were grouped as nonatopic subjects.\nAtopic sensitization was observed in 22 (29%) of 76 children. At 3 weeks, the bacterial cellular fatty acid profile in fecal samples differed significantly between infants in whom atopy was and was not developing (P =.005). By using fluorescence in situ hydridization, atopic subjects had more clostridia (geometric mean [95% confidence interval]: 9.3 x 10(7) [3.8-22.9 x 10(7)] vs 3.3 x 10(7) [1.8-6.1 x 10(7)], P =.04) and tended to have fewer bifidobacteria (1.8 x 10(9) [0.4-7.6 x 10(9)] vs 6.1 x 10(9) [2.5-14.6 x 10(9)], P =.11) in their stools than nonatopic subjects, resulting in a reduced ratio of bifidobacteria to clostridia (P =.03). The differences were not detected by bacterial cultivation.\nDifferences in the neonatal gut microflora precede the development of atopy, suggesting a crucial role of the balance of indigenous intestinal bacteria for the maturation of human immunity to a nonatopic mode.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Kalliom\u00e4ki, M","Kirjavainen, P","Eerola, E","Kero, P","Salminen, S","Isolauri, E"],"doi":"10.1067\/mai.2001.111237","first_seen_on":"2016-02-02T17:36:54+00:00","issns":["0091-6749"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1437216108,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11150002"],"pmid":"11150002","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Distinct patterns of neonatal gut microflora in infants in whom atopy was and was not developing.","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distinct-patterns-neonatal-gut-microflora-infants-whom-atopy-not-developing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366876,"mean":6.2761467230019,"rank":4466726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366876,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262218,"mean":9.753907473581,"rank":206985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262218,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3583,"mean":8.358783919598,"rank":3187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3583,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":22.847817258883,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
