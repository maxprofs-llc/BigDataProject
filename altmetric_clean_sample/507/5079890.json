Although growing, the number of available effective pain management approaches for SCI is limited. Recognizing the need to \"kick-start\" activity on this topic, a consensus-building workshop on developing a research agenda for SCI-related chronic pain was held in 2006 with an expert panel. The present paper describes the processes of the consensus-workshop and its associated outcomes towards advancing the research agenda for SCI-related pain in Canada. A commentary on the current state of knowledge regarding SCI-related pain is also provided. Methods Thirty-nine stakeholders (researchers, clinicians, policy-makers, SCI advocates, and people with SCI) attended the consensus-workshop. A modified Delphi approach was employed to gain consensus on identifying the top five SCI pain research priorities for improving QoL post-SCI. As well, project planning along with infrastructure support opportunities were discussed. Results The top five pain research priorities were: 1) pain management and treatment; 2) measurement tools; 3) health services policy and advocacy; 4) knowledge transfer; and 5) mechanisms of pain. Recommendations related to the priorities and related resources were generated, and pilot work was initiated. Conclusions The consensus workshop provided an initial roadmap for research on SCI-related chronic pain, and supported five pilot projects on the identified priorities. Reflections on the current research landscape in Canada and abroad suggest increased activity towards addressing pain post-SCI but evidence-based approaches are still lacking.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aaf","authors":["Sander L.
