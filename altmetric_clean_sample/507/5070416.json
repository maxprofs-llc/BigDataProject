At baseline, daily ED use and admission rates were not significantly different between beneficiaries in and not in hospice. By the week before death, nonhospice controls averaged 69.6 ED visits\/1,000 beneficiary-days, versus 7.6 for beneficiaries in hospice (rate ratio (RR) = 9.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 9.3-10.0). Inpatient admission rates in the last week of life were 63% for nonhospice controls and 42% for beneficiaries in hospice (RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.45-1.57). Of all beneficiaries in hospice, 28% enrolled during inpatient stays originating in EDs; they accounted for 35.7% (95% CI = 35.4-36.0%) of all hospice stays of less than 1 month and 13.9% (95% CI = 13.6-14.2%) of stays longer than 1 month.\nMost Medicare beneficiaries with cancer with a poor prognosis visited EDs at the end of life. Hospice enrollment was associated with lower ED use and admission rates. Many individuals enrolled in hospice during inpatient stays that followed ED visits, a phenomenon linked to shorter hospice stays. These findings must be interpreted carefully given potential unmeasured confounders in matching.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Obermeyer, Ziad","Clarke, Alissa C","Makar, Maggie","Schuur, Jeremiah D","Cutler, David M"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.13948","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T12:31:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-5415"],"journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1454340086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26805592"],"pmid":"26805592","pubdate":"2016-02-01T22:07:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Emergency Care Use and the Medicare Hospice Benefit for Individuals with Cancer with a Poor Prognosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emergency-care-medicare-hospice-benefit-individuals-cancer-poor-prognosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7069916,"mean":6.2881480770247,"rank":2758478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4298679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7069916,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320412,"mean":9.3460997780972,"rank":117200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":202468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320412,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2934,"mean":11.520669621548,"rank":1924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2934,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":31.393769230769,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
