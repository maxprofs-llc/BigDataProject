All examinations were interpreted by radiologists credentialed in structured CT lung screening reporting, following the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Lung Cancer Screening (version 1.2012). Positive results required a solid nodule \u22654 mm, a ground-glass nodule \u22655 mm, or a mediastinal or hilar lymph node >1 cm, not stable for >2 years. Significant incidental findings and findings suspicious for pulmonary infection were also recorded.\nA total of 1,760 examinations were performed (464 in group 2, 1,296 in group 1); no clinical follow-up was available in 432 patients (28%). Positive results, clinically significant incidental findings, and suspected pulmonary infection were present in 25%, 6%, and 6% in group 2 and 28.2%, 6.2%, and 6.6% in group 1, respectively. Twenty-three cases of lung cancer were diagnosed (6 in group 2, 17 in group 1), for annualized rates of malignancy of 1.8% in group 2 and 1.6% in group\u00a01.\nNCCN group 2 results were substantively similar to those for group 1 and closely resemble those reported in the National Lung Screening Trial. Similar rates of positivity and lung cancer diagnosis in both groups suggest that thousands of additional lives may be saved each year if screening eligibility is expanded to include this particular high-risk group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e95","authors":["Brady J.
