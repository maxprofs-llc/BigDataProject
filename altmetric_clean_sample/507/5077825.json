Hypertensive and diabetic people have higher risks of developing systemic inflammation. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC \u03c9-3 PUFAs) can reduce the cardiovascular events and help against inflammation.\nTo identify the effects of LC \u03c9-3 PUFAs on reducing the levels of inflammatory markers on hypertensive and\/or diabetic obese adults.\nSixty-four patients, who were hypertensive and\/or diabetic obese with high levels of inflammatory markers, from primary healthcare centers of Gaza City, Palestine, enrolled in two groups of an open-label, parallel, randomized, controlled trial for 8 weeks. Thirty-three patients were in the control group, and 31 patients were in the experimental group. The experimental group was treated with a daily dose of 300 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 200 mg of docosahexaenoic acid.\nTreatment with LC \u03c9-3 PUFAs significantly reduced the level of high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) [14.78\u00b110.7 to 8.49\u00b16.69 mg\/L, p<0.001], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [178.13\u00b158.54 to 157.32\u00b159.77 mg\/dL, p=0.024], and triglyceride (TG) [209.23\u00b1108.3 to 167.0\u00b179.9 mg\/dL, p<0.05] after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas no significant changes appeared in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and total cholesterol (TC). In the control group, significant reduction was detected for FBG [187.15\u00b164.8 to 161.91\u00b137.9 mg\/dL, p<0.05] and TG [202.91\u00b1107.0 to 183.45\u00b195.82 mg\/dL, p<0.05], and no changes for hs-CRP, IL-6, or TC. By comparing the experimental group with the changes of control group at the endpoint, LC \u03c9-3 PUFAs did not reach the clinical significance in treating effectiveness for any of the clinical variables.\nLC \u03c9-3 PUFAs have recommended effects on health; the obtained results can improve the role of LC \u03c9-3 PUFAs as a protective factor on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. The time allowed or the dose used could be insufficient to achieve full treatment affectivity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f4","authors":["Ellulu, Mohammed S","Khaza'ai, Huzwah","Patimah, Ismail","Rahmat, Asmah","Abed, Yehia"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-02T13:57:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1654-661X"],"journal":"Food & Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1498223466,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26829184","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26829184?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26829184"],"pmid":"26829184","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Effect of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on inflammation and metabolic markers in hypertensive and\/or diabetic obese adults: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-long-chain-omega3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-inflammation-metabolic-markers-hypertensive-and-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.08,"score_history":{"1y":17,"6m":17,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":272083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8142214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336462,"mean":9.6728536383113,"rank":15980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":320476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336462,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":10.162365795724,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":21.231267605634,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
