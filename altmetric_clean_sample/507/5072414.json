FSW were categorised as professionals and part-time sex workers (PTSW). After a face-to-face questionnaire, blood and urine samples were collected for HIV, HSV-2, genital infections and pregnancy. High-risk behaviour was defined as a recent unprotected sex with either casual clients, regular clients or regular partners.\nWe recruited 609 FSW including 188 (30.9%) professionals. Their median age was 21\u2005years (IQR 19-23), and the prevalence of HIV was 10.3% among professionals and 6.5% among PTSW. Only 3 of 46 HIV-infected women were aware of their status. Overall, 277 (45.6%) women reported high-risk behaviours (41.2% among professionals and 47.5% among PTSW), which were driven mainly by non-systematic condom use with regular partners. In multivariable analysis, PTSW (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.89; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.82) and having a primary (AOR=1.75; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.67) or higher education level (AOR=1.80; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.89) remained associated with high-risk behaviours. HIV infection was associated with older age (AOR=1.44; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.71), with being married\/cohabiting (AOR=2.70; 95% CI 1.21 to 6.04) and with Trichomonas vaginalis infection (AOR=9.63; 95% CI 2.93 to 31.59), while history of HIV testing was associated with a decreased risk (AOR=0.18; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40).\nThis study highlights the need for targeted interventions among young FSW focusing particularly on PTSW, sexual behaviours with regular partners and regular HIV testing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003525","authors":["Isidore T Traore","Noelie M Hema","Anselme Sanon","Felicien Some","Djeneba Ouedraogo","Roselyne Some","Josiane Niessougou","Issouf Konate","Philippe Mayaud","Philippe Van De Perre","Nicolas Meda","Nicolas Nagot"],"doi":"10.1136\/sextrans-2015-052038","endpage":"553","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T19:16:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-3263","1368-4973"],"issue":"7","journal":"Sexually Transmitted Infections","last_mentioned_on":1490188204,"links":["http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/31\/sextrans-2015-052038.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/31\/sextrans-2015-052038.short?rss=1","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/31\/sextrans-2015-052038.short?g=w_sti_ahead_tab","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/92\/7\/550?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/cgi\/content\/short\/92\/7\/550?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/92\/7\/550.abstract","http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/92\/7\/550?hootPostID=e5ba9d97129c61b020a4d80be48492a7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/01\/31\/sextrans-2015-052038.full.pdf","pmid":"26834073","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"sextrans-2015-052038","subjects":["sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"HIV risk and behaviour among part-time versus professional FSW: baseline report of an interventional cohort in Burkina Faso","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/sti.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/sextrans-2015-052038","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv-risk-behaviour-among-parttime-versus-professional-fsw-baseline-report-interventional-cohort-burk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.8,"score_history":{"1y":4.8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":1317538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7076637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336624,"mean":9.6488294145078,"rank":66613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":269820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336624,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2000,"mean":8.8222261130565,"rank":497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2000,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":15.231224489796,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
