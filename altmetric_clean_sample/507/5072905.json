Although the mechanisms underlying cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activation, which triggers mitotic entry, have been extensively studied, the regulatory mechanisms that couple CDK1-cyclin B activity to chromosome stability are not well understood. Here, we identified a signaling axis in which Aurora B activity is modulated by CDK1-cyclin B via the acetyltransferase TIP60 in human cell division. CDK1-cyclin B phosphorylates Ser90 of TIP60, which elicits TIP60-dependent acetylation of Aurora B and promotes accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis. Mechanistically, TIP60 acetylation of Aurora B at Lys215 protects Aurora B's activation loop from dephosphorylation by the phosphatase PP2A to ensure a robust, error-free metaphase-anaphase transition. These findings delineate a conserved signaling cascade that integrates protein phosphorylation and acetylation with cell cycle progression for maintenance of genomic stability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Fei Mo","Xiaoxuan Zhuang","Xing Liu","Phil Y Yao","Bo Qin","Zeqi Su","Jianye Zang","Zhiyong Wang","Jiancun Zhang","Zhen Dou","Changlin Tian","Maikun Teng","Liwen Niu","Donald L Hill","Guowei Fang","Xia Ding","Chuanhai Fu","Xuebiao Yao"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.2017","first_seen_on":"2016-02-01T21:37:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1456751459,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nchembio\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nchembio.2017.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26829474?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nchembio.2017"],"pmid":"26829474","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Small molecules","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cell division","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Post-translational modifications","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"DNA damage and repair","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Acetylation of Aurora B by TIP60 ensures accurate chromosomal segregation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acetylation-aurora-b-tip60-ensures-accurate-chromosomal-segregation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.58,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7313486,"mean":6.3735475029997,"rank":650681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6662505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7313486,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322614,"mean":9.41184964648,"rank":39468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":283119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322614,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1551,"mean":15.387961290323,"rank":535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1551,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":22.408425531915,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
