Since detecting telomeres in aging and diseases like cancer, is important, the direct detection of telomeres has been a very useful biomarker. We propose a telomere detection method using a newly synthesized quantum dot (QD) based probe with oligonucleotide conjugation and direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). QD-oligonucleotides were prepared with metal coordination bonding based on platinum-guanine binding reported in our previous work. The QD-oligonucleotide conjugation method has an advantage where any sequence containing guanine at the end can be easily bound to the starting QD-Pt conjugate. A synthesized telomeric oligonucleotide was bound to the QD-Pt conjugate successfully and this probe hybridized specifically on the telomere of fabricated MV-4-11 and MOLT-4 chromosomes. Additionally, the QD-telomeric oligonucleotide probe successfully detected the telomeres on the CGH metaphase slide. Due to the excellent photostability and high quantum yield of QDs, the QD-oligonucleotide probe has high fluorescence intensity when compared to the organic dye-oligonucleotide probe. Our QD-oligonucleotide probe, conjugation method of this QD probe, and hybridization protocol with the chromosomes can be a useful tool for chromosome painting and FISH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Hwang, Gyoyeon","Lee, Hansol","Lee, Jiyeon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.09.161","first_seen_on":"2016-02-02T11:22:35+00:00","issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1454430557,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26449454?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26449454"],"pmid":"26449454","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Direct fluorescence in situ hybridization on human metaphase chromosomes using quantum dot-platinum labeled DNA probes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-fluorescence-situ-hybridization-human-metaphase-chromosomes-using-quantum-dotplatinum-labeled"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7084078,"mean":6.2895256542212,"rank":5310541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":991501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7084078,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320256,"mean":9.3667823265832,"rank":220992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":55951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320256,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7777,"mean":2.722683899177,"rank":6085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7777,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":1.9576708860759,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
