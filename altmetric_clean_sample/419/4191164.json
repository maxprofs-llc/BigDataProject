Interestingly, the canine olfactory apparatus was observed to detect cancer in two anecdotal reports. After the description of these events, researchers began to study this phenomenon in a structured way in order to assess the ability of canines in detecting cancer-related VOCs. Due to the fact that some of these studies have shown that the canine olfactory apparatus is highly proficient in the detection of cancer-related VOCs, in this article we assess the possibility of constructing a bioelectronic-nose, based on canine olfactory receptors (ORs), for the purpose of diagnosing cancer in a more sensitive, specific, and cost effective manner than what is available nowadays. Furthermore, in order to prove the feasibility and the need of the proposed apparatus, we searched for the following type of articles: all of the studies that have examined, to our knowledge, the ability of dogs in detecting cancer; articles that assess the dog olfactory receptor (OR) gene repertoire, since a central part of the proposed bioelectronic nose is being able to recognize the odorant that emanates from the cancerous lesion, and for that purpose is necessary to express the canine ORs in heterologous cells; examples of articles that depict different devices that have been built for the purpose of detecting cancer-related VOCs, so as to assess if the construction of the proposed apparatus is needed; and articles that describe examples of already constructed bioelectronic noses, in order to demonstrate the existence of a technical precedent and thus the plausibility of the proposed device.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008126","authors":["Pomerantz, Alan","Blachman-Braun, Ruben","Galnares-Olalde, Javier Andr\u00e9s","Berebichez-Fridman, Roberto","Capurso-Garc\u00eda, Marino"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mehy.2015.04.024","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T03:45:49+00:00","issns":["1532-2777","03069877"],"issue":"2","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","last_mentioned_on":1461665436,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306987715001796","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25936534?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25936534","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The possibility of inventing new technologies in the detection of cancer by applying elements of the canine olfactory apparatus ","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/possibility-inventing-new-technologies-detection-cancer-applying-elements-canine-olfactory-apparatus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":3481977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3954198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225225,"mean":8.1186684101163,"rank":99718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":117197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225225,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2047,"mean":6.6227546432063,"rank":1079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2047,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":11.768604651163,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
