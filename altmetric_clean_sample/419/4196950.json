Three groups of tibial inserts of the same design were matched: roughened gamma-air (RGA), polished gamma-air (PGA), and polished gas-plasma (PGP). Visual damage scoring and micro-CT deviation maps were used for evaluation. Total backside damage was higher (P=0.045) in RGA (13.8\u00b13.4) compared to PGA (8.7\u00b13.4) and PGP (8.2\u00b14.8). Backside wear rates were greatest (P=0.02) in RGA (0.038\u00a0mm\/year), followed by PGA (0.012\u00a0mm\/year), and lowest in PGP (0.009\u00a0mm\/year). Use of a roughened tibial baseplate had a greater effect on wear magnitude than sterilization method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Teeter, Matthew G","Lanting, Brent A","Shrestha, Kush R","Howard, James L","Vasarhelyi, Edward M","Matthew G.
