However, the physiological role of IFN-\u03b3 production by brain-resident cells, including glial cells, in resistance against cerebral infections remains unknown. We analyzed the role of IFN-\u03b3 production by brain-resident cells in resistance to reactivation of cerebral infection with Toxoplasma gondii using a murine model. Our study using bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that IFN-\u03b3 production by brain-resident cells is essential for upregulating IFN-\u03b3-mediated protective innate immune responses to restrict cerebral T. gondii growth. Studies using a transgenic strain that expresses IFN-\u03b3 only in CD11b(+) cells suggested that IFN-\u03b3 production by microglia, which is the only CD11b(+) cell population among brain-resident cells, is able to suppress the parasite growth. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 produced by brain-resident cells is pivotal for recruiting T cells into the brain to control the infection. These results indicate that IFN-\u03b3 produced by brain-resident cells is crucial for facilitating both the protective innate and T cell-mediated immune responses to control cerebral infection with T. gondii.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Sa, Qila","Ochiai, Eri","Tiwari, Ashish","Perkins, Sara","Mullins, Jeremi","Gehman, Marie","Huckle, William","Eyestone, Willard H","Saunders, Thomas L","Shelton, Brent J","Suzuki, Yasuhiro","Qila Sa","Eri Ochiai","Ashish Tiwari","Sara Perkins","Jeremi Mullins","Marie Gehman","William Huckle","Willard H.
