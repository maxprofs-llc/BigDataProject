We observe the performance of addiction recovery narrative in the face of heavy social constraints limiting access to care. Fee-based residential rehabilitation ('rehab') is the only treatment locally available and inaccessible to most. Its recovery potential is doubted, given normative expectations of relapse. Treating drug use is a product of tightly bounded agency. Individuals enact strategies to maximise their slim chances of treatment access ('access work'), develop self-care alternatives when these fail to materialise and ration their care expectations. The use of rehab as a primary means of respite and harm reduction rather than recovery and the individuation of care in the absence of an enabling recovery environment are key characteristics of drug treatment experience. The recent incorporation of 'harm reduction' into policy discourses may trouble the primacy of recovery narrative in addiction treatment and in how treatment desires are voiced. The diversification of drug treatments in combination with social interventions enabling their access are fundamental.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f0","authors":["Rhodes, Tim","Ndimbii, James","Guise, Andy","Cullen, Lucy","Ayon, Sylvia"],"doi":"10.1080\/17441692.2015.1046385","endpage":"880","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T07:40:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-1706","1744-1692"],"issue":"7","journal":"Global Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1440701038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26089184?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17441692.2015.1046385","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17441692.2015.1046385?journalCode=rgph20&"],"pmid":"26089184","pubdate":"2015-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"867","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Navigating the poverty of heroin addiction treatment and recovery opportunity in Kenya: Access work, self-care and rationed expectations","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/navigating-poverty-heroin-addiction-treatment-recovery-opportunity-kenya-access-work-selfcare-ration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557318,"mean":6.3845700736537,"rank":2217810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3299126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557318,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191209,"mean":8.5066599514666,"rank":72458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":116378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191209,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":4.8786014319809,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.9357142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
