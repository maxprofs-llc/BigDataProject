The majority (77.3%) knew about e-cigarettes; 15.2% reported that they had tried an e-cigarette, and 60% reported that e-cigarettes were safe or had minimal health hazards. Only 5.4% reported that schools had offered information about e-cigarette use. One quarter (24.9%) reported ever cigarette smoking, and 13.3% reported ever using smokeless tobacco. E-cigarette use was positively associated with older age, tobacco use, male gender, Caucasian race, mother's e-cigarette use, biological parents' tobacco use, and lower academic performance, whereas negatively associated with having a mother who never used e-cigarettes, not knowing any e-cigarette users, and living with mother (p < .05).\nE-cigarette use and awareness is evident among high school students in North Carolina. A high number of smokers and smokeless tobacco users are using e-cigarettes simultaneously, and many perceive e-cigarettes as healthy and with minimal health hazards. Also, there is limited school-based education about e-cigarettes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059ec","authors":["Anand, Vivek","McGinty, Kaye L","O'Brien, Kevin","Guenthner, Gregory","Hahn, Ellen","Martin, Catherine A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jadohealth.2015.03.018","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T16:03:39+00:00","funders":["niehs","phs"],"issns":["1054-139X","1879-1972"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Adolescent Health","last_mentioned_on":1452023295,"links":["http:\/\/www.jahonline.org\/article\/S1054-139X(15)00125-1\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jadohealth.2015.03.018","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1054139X15001251"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jahonline.org\/article\/S1054139X15001251\/pdf","pmid":"26095408","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"E-cigarette Use and Beliefs Among Urban Public High School Students in North Carolina","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ecigarette-beliefs-among-urban-public-high-school-students-north-carolina-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":1443028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5454256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222385,"mean":7.9673927440825,"rank":57671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":164098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222385,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1749,"mean":12.893014874142,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1749,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":17.082538461538,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
