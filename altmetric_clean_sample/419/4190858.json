Patients who were younger than 18 years of age, who were dead on arrival and whose triage information was not available were excluded. TRACT was implemented in August 2010, and the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) was used for triage. Primary and secondary outcomes were ED mortality and ED LOS. Multivariate logistic regression models for ED mortality and multivariable general linear models on the ED LOS were used to compare the before- and after-intervention periods.\nFor the 155\u2009563 visits over study period, the ED mortality rate was 0.2%, and the ED LOS was 4.6\u2009h (median). The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of the TRACT protocol on ED mortality were 0.69 (0.54-0.88) for total patients, 0.42 (0.30-0.59) for ESI 1, 1.04 (0.66-1.65) for ESI 2 and 1.45 (0.76-2.75) for ESI 3 group. The adjusted coefficients (95% CIs) of the TRACT on the ED LOS were -88.1 (-96.9 \u223c -79.2)\u2009min for all patients, -44.9 (-72.0 \u223c -17.9)\u2009min for ESI level 2 and -104.3 (-114.7 \u223c -94.0)\u2009min for ESI level 3.\nThe TRACT protocol decreased the ED mortality in ESI 1 group and reduced the ED LOS in ESI levels 2 and 3 groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ba","authors":["Ro, Young Sun","Shin, Sang Do","Song, Kyoung Jun","Cha, Won Chul","Cho, Jin Sung"],"doi":"10.1111\/1742-6723.12426","endpage":"335","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T00:17:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1742-6723"],"issue":"4","journal":"Emergency Medicine Australasia","last_mentioned_on":1434759327,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1742-6723.12426\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1742-6723.12426\/pdf","pmid":"26075591","pubdate":"2015-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"328","subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Triage\u2010based resource allocation and clinical treatment protocol on outcome and length of stay in the emergency department","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/triagebased-resource-allocation-clinical-treatment-protocol-outcome-length-stay-emergency-department"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5252083,"mean":6.1865725188618,"rank":3696482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":879761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5252083,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184756,"mean":8.5341770994019,"rank":129560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":35053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184756,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":6.8819822064057,"rank":471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.480303030303,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
