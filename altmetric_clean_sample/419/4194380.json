However, the only corrective method for lead migration is revision surgery, which may cause additional complications. Here, we describe a new technique for adjusting a transversely migrated SCS lead. The medical records of four patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or failed back surgery syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a01) who underwent implantation of percutaneous leads for SCS were retrospectively reviewed. Transverse lead migration was diagnosed radiographically after patients reported recurrence of pain or numbness in treated sites. The guide wire from the SCS implant kit was bent and inserted into the target epidural space using a 14-gauge Tuohy needle. When the guide wire contacted the migrated SCS lead, they were advanced to the correct location under C-arm guidance. After re-adjustment of the SCS lead, good coverage of the electrical stimulation was confirmed. Patients were followed for 9-19\u00a0months and they reported satisfactory pain relief and good electrical coverage after adjusting the SCS lead. Here, we describe a new technique for adjusting a transversely migrated SCS lead using a percutaneous epidural approach as a simple, safe, and cost-effective alternative to revision surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c81","authors":["Sang Yoon Jeon","Jae Young Ji","Sie Hyeon Yoo","Jin Young Chon","Sung Hoon Jung","Ho Sik Moon"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00540-015-2038-4","first_seen_on":"2015-06-21T15:32:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1438-8359"],"journal":"Journal of Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1434900685,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00540-015-2038-4"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00540-015-2038-4.pdf","pmid":"26094104","pubdate":"2015-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Percutaneous adjustment method for transversely migrated spinal cord stimulation leads: a technical report","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-adjustment-method-transversely-migrated-spinal-cord-stimulation-leads-technical-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5258442,"mean":6.1904978951007,"rank":2606707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2493974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5258442,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185355,"mean":8.5095426589123,"rank":93480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":83761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185355,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":1.0835537720706,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.2022727272727,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
