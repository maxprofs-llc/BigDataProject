To date, no studies have yet been conducted regarding its function in the heart. In the present study, we have identified that HLP binds the cytosolic region of RyR2 in the heart using a bacterial two-hybrid system, LC-MS\/MS, co-immunoprecipitation, and GST-pull down assays. Microscopy revealed that HLP forms a triple complex with RyR2 and caveolin-3. siRNA and adenovirus-mediated KD of HLP decreased the electrically evoked Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum without directly affecting SERCA2 and RyR2 activities. Collectively, the HLP-RyR2 interaction in the cell surface caveolae region may be essential for efficient excitation-contraction coupling in the heart.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Song, Dong Woo","Lee, Kyung-Eun","Ryu, Jae Yong","Jeon, Hyesung","Kim, Do Han"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.06.045","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T07:26:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104","0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1434957985,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X15300991"],"pmid":"26071359","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"The molecular interaction of heart LIM protein (HLP) with RyR2 and caveolin-3 is essential for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in the heart ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-interaction-heart-lim-protein-hlp-ryr2-caveolin3-essential-casup2supinduced-casup2sup-rele"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263697,"mean":6.1954563656434,"rank":2791816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1787443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263697,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185536,"mean":8.5020102514352,"rank":102729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185536,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7107,"mean":2.573805516465,"rank":4881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7107,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":1.255632183908,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
