In our experimental research single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of gemcitabine 25 mg\/kg provided increase in median survival of mice with intracranially transplanted Ehrlich carcinoma by 41-89% (p < 0.001). In this experimental model i.p. administration of gemcitabine (permeability of the BBB of less than 10%), carmustine (good permeability of the BBB), cyclophosphamide (poor permeability of the BBB) and cisplatin (doesn't penetrate through the BBB) increased median survival of mice by 88% (p < 0.001), 59% (p = 0.001), 35% (p = 0.005) and 18% (p = 0.302) respectively. Considering strong correlation between antitumor activity of the drugs (carmustine, cyclophosphamide and cisplatin) and their permeability of the BBB, efficacy of gemcitabine in intracranial tumors could be due to its wide range of therapeutic doses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d003","authors":["Stukov, A N","Filatova, L V","Latipova, D Kh","Bespalov, V G","Belyaeva, O A","Kireeva, G S","Vasilieva, I N","Alexandrov, V A","Maidin, M A","Semenov, A L","Vershinina, S F","Markochev, A B","Abduloeva, N Kh","Chubenko, V A","Semiglazova, T Yu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T10:31:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0507-3758"],"issue":"2","journal":"Voprosy onkologii","last_mentioned_on":1434796264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26087611?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26087611","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Therapeutic activity of gemcitabine in intracranial tumors].","type":"article","volume":"61"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5254215,"mean":6.1867966413265,"rank":2786254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1784699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5254215,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184752,"mean":8.5337461123351,"rank":102476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184752,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.4561224489796,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bbbpapers\/status\/612206023802097664","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192011],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T10:31:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Blood brain barrier","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/440531504972578816\/fylYz-PG_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #bbb papers in #PubMed.
