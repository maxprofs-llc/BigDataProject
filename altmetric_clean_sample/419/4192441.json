Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension were more prone to unstable angina pectoris (p=0.009), while patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were more prone to venous thrombosis (p=0.04) and deep venous thrombosis of the inferior extremities (p=0.04). Patients with pulmonary microthrombosis were more prone to unstable angina pectoris (p=0.026), arterial thrombosis (p=0.002), venous thrombosis (p=0.001), deep venous thrombosis of the inferior extremities (p=0.001), and superficial thrombophlebitis of the inferior extremities (p=0.001). The presence of LA was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary embolism and infarction (p=0.001), secondary pulmonary hypertension (p=0.032), and pulmonary microthrombosis (p=0.001).\nPresence of LA was associated with distinct pulmonary manifestations in the Serbian APS cohort. There is a strong link between some cardiovascular and pulmonary manifestations in PAPS patients, suggesting complexity and evolutionary nature of PAPS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ef6","authors":["Stojanovich, Ljudmila","Djokovic, Aleksandra","Kontic, Milika"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T13:53:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0392-856X"],"journal":"Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1435000411,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26088955?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26088955?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26088955","pubdate":"2015-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Antiphospholipid-mediated thrombosis: interplay between type of antibodies and localisation of lung, and cardiovascular incidences in primary antiphospholipid syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiphospholipidmediated-thrombosis-interplay-between-type-antibodies-localisation-lung-cardiovascul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263697,"mean":6.1954563656434,"rank":2341178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2864303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263697,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184877,"mean":8.5380120296849,"rank":80574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":100872,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184877,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":548,"mean":2.2760219378428,"rank":187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":548,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.0725,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InCardiology\/status\/612860725476720640","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192441],"posted_on":"2015-06-22T05:52:38+00:00","author":{"name":"India Cardiology 2.0","url":"http:\/\/cardiology.hcsm.in","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888392364\/j0402858_normal.jpg","description":"Top News and Links For The Indian Cardiologist","id_on_source":"InCardiology","tweeter_id":"142214712","geo":{"lt":20,"ln":77,"country":"IN"},"followers":2499},"tweet_id":"612860725476720640"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CardioResearch\/status\/612853181891022849","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192441],"posted_on":"2015-06-22T05:22:39+00:00","author":{"name":"cardio-research.com","url":"http:\/\/www.cardio-research.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1687818832\/with_website_normal.jpg","description":"http:\/\/t.co\/6HkOR9DFvf is an independent website with an aim to promote Basic Cardiovascular Research.","id_on_source":"CardioResearch","tweeter_id":"236133741","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5878},"tweet_id":"612853181891022849"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/status\/612256725043822592","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192441],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T13:52:33+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":443},"tweet_id":"612256725043822592"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lunge_zh\/status\/613062276522704896","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192441],"posted_on":"2015-06-22T19:13:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Lunge Z\u00fcrich","url":"http:\/\/www.lunge-zuerich.ch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/478546674726367232\/zdEmDmAG_normal.jpeg","description":"Lunge Z\u00fcrich ist kompetenter Ansprechpartner im Kanton f\u00fcr alle Fragen im Bereich Lungen, Luft und Atmung.","id_on_source":"lunge_zh","tweeter_id":"95442268","geo":{"lt":47.41667,"ln":8.66667,"country":"CH"},"followers":203},"tweet_id":"613062276522704896"}]}}
