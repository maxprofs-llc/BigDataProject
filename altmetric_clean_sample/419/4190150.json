Mori Fructus is a well-known traditional herbal medicine, food, and dietary supplement. This study employed models of amyloid beta (A\u03b2)-induced AD to investigate the protective effects of Mori Fructus ethanol extract (ME) against age-related disease and cognitive deficits.\nTo examine the protective effect of ME, we measured cell viability, cytotoxicity, and survival in rat primary hippocampal cultures. We performed behavioral tests and histological analysis in mouse models of AD induced by A\u03b225-35 toxicity. To investigate the mechanism underlying the protective effect, we performed western blotting using antibodies against apoptotic markers as well as the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), and tau. We also measured apoptotic marker fluorescence intensity.\nME significantly attenuated A\u03b2-induced cell damage, enhanced Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, and reduced tau phosphorylation. ME reduced apoptotic markers that were activated by GSK-3\u03b2, and reduced reactive oxygen species production. Further, ME decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)\/Bcl-2-associated X expression ratio, mitochondria depolarization, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation. We confirmed that ME treatment improved cognitive impairment and neuronal cell death induced by A\u03b225-35 toxicity in the mouse hippocampus via its antiapoptotic activity.\nThese results indicate that ME protects cognition and neurons in AD-like models induced by A\u03b2 via reduction of tau phosphorylation and apoptosis through GSK-3\u03b2 inactivation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f23cf058f610002d8d","authors":["Kim, Hyo Geun","Park, Gunhyuk","Lim, Soonmin","Park, Hanbyeol","Choi, Jin Gyu","Jeong, Hyun Uk","Kang, Min Seo","Lee, Mi Kyeong","Oh, Myung Sook"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2015.05.054","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T18:59:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7573"],"journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1434672000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26068423"],"pmid":"26068423","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["socialsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Mori Fructus improves cognitive and neuronal dysfunction induced by beta-amyloid toxicity through the GSK-3\u03b2 pathway in vitro and in vivo.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mori-fructus-improves-cognitive-neuronal-dysfunction-induced-betaamyloid-toxicity-through-gsk3%CE%B2-path"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234334,"mean":6.1825716182004,"rank":747138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4443990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234334,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184337,"mean":8.5033313297458,"rank":35481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":147353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184337,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2034,"mean":3.0551942941466,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2034,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.2408,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
