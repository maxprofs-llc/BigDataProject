To explore the mechanisms of AGEs-endothelium interactions through the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) in the PKC-\u03b2 pathway, we evaluated the production of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 in human endothelial cells (HUVECs), monocytes, and a coculture of both. AGEs were prepared by albumin glycation and characterized by absorbance and electrophoresis. The effect of AGEs on cell viability was assessed with an MTT assay. The cells were also treated with AGEs with and without a PKC-\u03b2 inhibitor. MCP-1 and VCAM-1 in the cell supernatants were estimated by ELISA, and RAGE was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. AGEs exposure did not affect cell viability, but AGEs induced RAGE, MCP-1, and VCAM-1 expression in HUVECs. When HUVECs or monocytes were incubated with AGEs and a PKC-\u03b2 inhibitor, MCP-1 and VCAM-1 expression significantly decreased. However, in the coculture, exposure to AGEs and a PKC-\u03b2 inhibitor produced no significant effect. This study demonstrates, in vitro, the regulatory mechanisms involved in MCP-1 production in three cellular models and VCAM-1 production in HUVECs, and thus mimics the endothelial dysfunction caused by AGEs in early atherosclerosis. Such mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets to reduce the harmful effects of AGEs in patients with chronic kidney disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004677","authors":["Rempel, Lisienny C T","Finco, Alessandra B","Maciel, Rayana A P","Bosquetti, Bruna","Alvarenga, Larissa M","Souza, Wesley M","Pecoits-Filho, Roberto","Stinghen, Andr\u00e9a E M"],"doi":"10.3390\/toxins7051722","first_seen_on":"2015-06-23T05:59:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2072-6651"],"issue":"5","journal":"Toxins","last_mentioned_on":1435039127,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26008233\/?i=60&from=%22advanced%20glycation%22"],"pmid":"26008233","title":"Effect of PKC-\u03b2 Signaling Pathway on Expression of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 in Different Cell Models in Response to Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs).","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-pkc%CE%B2-signaling-pathway-expression-mcp1-vcam1-different-cell-models-response-advanced-glycatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5268528,"mean":6.2009945015013,"rank":4386251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5268528,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185424,"mean":8.5108064479597,"rank":150002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185424,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":543,"mean":2.4391660516605,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":543,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":1.3326923076923,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
