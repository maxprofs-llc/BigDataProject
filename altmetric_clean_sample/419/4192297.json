The present study was aimed to identify the factors influencing intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, and recovery in patients undergoing spinal surgery.\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 183 consecutive patients with lumbar disc herniation who underwent spine surgery. The clinical characteristics, operation procedure, and outcome were documented and the correlations were analyzed.\nThere were significant differences between one-level and two-level operations in the bleeding volumes of male (P\u2009=\u20090.005) and female (P\u2009=\u20090.002) patients, and in final drainage of male (P\u2009=\u20090.043) and female (P\u2009=\u20090.003) patients. The blood loss was correlated with the operation duration. There were differences in intraoperative bleeding and final drainage between groups with one-level and two-level operations. Additionally, there were differences in intraoperative autologous blood transfusion among various groups. There were significant differences in intraoperative bleeding between autologous blood transfusion and non-transfusion groups.\nThe key factors affecting the intraoperative blood loss and postoperative drainage volume include operation methods, operation duration, blood-transfusion modes, and usage of anticoagulants. These results should be taken into consideration in the attempt to optimize operation procedure and improve post-operative recovery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007da","authors":["Haibo Zou","Zhongshi Li","Houfu Sheng","Mingsheng Tan","Feng Yang","Li Liang","Jingxin Zhao"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12893-015-0062-9","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T12:29:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2482"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1436788409,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2482\/15\/76"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12893-015-0062-9.pdf","pmid":"26091671","pubdate":"2015-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and recovery in patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraoperative-blood-loss-postoperative-drainage-recovery-patients-undergoing-lumbar-spinal-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5347972,"mean":6.2583700902662,"rank":1099797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":4242928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5347972,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185899,"mean":8.5652753875783,"rank":47910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":137626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185899,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":2.5364714285714,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.4448275862069,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AuroraSpine\/status\/620382414620237824","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192297],"posted_on":"2015-07-13T00:01:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Aurora","url":"http:\/\/aurora-spine.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/472440570678218754\/B1a3Oqn5_normal.jpeg","description":"Aurora Spine was formed to bring #innovation to minimally-invasive #spine surgery, regenerative medicine, and the #aging patient.","id_on_source":"AuroraSpine","tweeter_id":"900648750","geo":{"lt":33.15809,"ln":-117.35059,"country":"US"},"followers":923},"tweet_id":"620382414620237824"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgeryScience\/status\/612235745604964352","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192297],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T12:29:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Research","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552556384688939009\/rWmyj-8R_normal.jpeg","description":"Latest surgical research journal papers as they're published | Academic updates and CME | @DrEdFitzgerald","id_on_source":"SurgeryScience","tweeter_id":"2707749445","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2371},"tweet_id":"612235745604964352"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MDHotline\/status\/612316234617614337","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192297],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T17:49:01+00:00","author":{"name":"MD Hotline","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000314782568\/79c8147883dea2d313922a28480d70f6_normal.png","description":"Find a doctor near you - right now.","id_on_source":"MDHotline","tweeter_id":"1679209382","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":119},"tweet_id":"612316234617614337"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cmp_gmbh\/status\/620532038886653952","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192297],"posted_on":"2015-07-13T09:55:41+00:00","author":{"name":"CMP GmbH","url":"http:\/\/www.creativemedical.de","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/638138231444402177\/bTyvsEsY_normal.jpg","description":"Solutions.
