Helmuth von Moltke, chief of the Prussian and German general staffs from 1858 to 1888, issued \"directives\" to his officers rather than specific commands. These guidelines for autonomous decision making encouraged Moltke's subordinates to show individual initiative. In this article, Hans Hinterhuber and Wolfgang Popp translate Moltke's example into business terms. According to Moltke, strategy is applied common sense and cannot be taught. The authors suggest that good entrepreneurs and managers--along with generals--are born with the qualities that make them successful. But even if managers have the potential to be good strategists, they must develop and hone their natural talents. And CEOs and top management can help by identifying and promoting such talents in their employees. Hinterhuber and Popp have created a questionnaire that helps measure strategic management competence. Managers and entrepreneurs take this test themselves, answering ten questions such as, \"Do I have an entrepreneurial vision?\", \"Do I have a corporate philosophy?\", and \"Do I have competitive advantages?\" Using the questionnaire, company management can evaluate managers being considered for a promotion. At the same time, those who take the test can use it to determine their own performance as strategists. Strategic managers provide subordinates with general guidelines, just as Helmuth von Moltke issued directives to his officers. And outstanding entrepreneurs create a corporate culture in which their vision, philosophy, and business strategies are implemented by employees who think independently.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5933cf058f610004f63","authors":["Hinterhuber, H H","Popp, W"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T05:14:50+00:00","issns":["0017-8012"],"issue":"1","journal":"Harvard Business Review","last_mentioned_on":1434777250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10119710\/"],"pmid":"10119710","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Business And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Economics, Econometrics and Finance"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Are you a strategist or just a manager?","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategist-just-manager"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5254161,"mean":6.1867553074158,"rank":2786236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1784662,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5254161,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184750,"mean":8.5339809795995,"rank":102477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":64137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184750,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":3.8201495327103,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
