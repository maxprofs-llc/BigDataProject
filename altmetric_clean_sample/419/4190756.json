Children living in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV rates are disproportionately high, may be at increased risk.AimsTo identify predictors, including HIV status, of suicidal ideation and behaviour in Rwandan children aged 10-17.MethodMatched case-control study of 683 HIV-positive, HIV-affected (seronegative children with an HIV-positive caregiver), and unaffected children and their caregivers.ResultsOver 20% of HIV-positive and affected children engaged in suicidal behaviour in the previous 6 months, compared with 13% of unaffected children. Children were at increased risk if they met criteria for depression, were at high-risk for conduct disorder, reported poor parenting or had caregivers with mental health problems.ConclusionsPolicies and programmes that address mental health concerns and support positive parenting may prevent suicidal ideation and behaviour in children at increased risk related to HIV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057a0","authors":["Ng, Lauren C","Kirk, Catherine M","Kanyanganzi, Frederick","Smith Fawzi, Mary C","Sezibera, Vincent","Shema, Evelyne","Bizimana, Justin I","Cyamatare, Felix R","Betancourt, Theresa S"],"doi":"10.1192\/bjp.bp.114.154591","first_seen_on":"2015-06-19T23:12:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1472-1465"],"issue":"3","journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1443779657,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26045350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/bjp.rcpsych.org\/content\/207\/3\/262.large.jpg?rss=1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4555444\/?report=classic"],"pmid":"26045350","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Risk and Protective Factors of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior in Rwandan Children","type":"article","volume":"207","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-protective-factors-suicidal-ideation-behaviour-rwandan-children-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6422619,"mean":5.8865586600353,"rank":1376271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5030542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6422619,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192128,"mean":8.5782770875516,"rank":57324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":133937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192128,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3164,"mean":10.262369269681,"rank":1429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3164,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":15.700045977011,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1,"NL":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation and behaviour in Rwandan children.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=694822063979391&id=171760059618930","license":"public","citation_ids":[4190756],"posted_on":"2015-06-06T11:52:37+00:00","summary":"Related Articles Risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation and behaviour in Rwandan children.
