Endotoxin was quantitatively measured by chromogenic method of limulus lysate test. Results of the study demonstrated that endotoxin was fairly efficiently removed by CAAC-II. It may therefore be possible for effective adsorption of endotoxin in vivo studies and warrant further experimental study for CAAC-II hemoperfusion in clinical endotoxemia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d05e","authors":["Du, X N","Niu, Z","Zhou, G Z","Li, Z M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T06:54:48+00:00","issns":["0890-5533"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biomaterials artificial cells and artificial organs","last_mentioned_on":1501643855,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3449139","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/3449139\/?i=32&from=\/trending"],"pmid":"3449139","pubdate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","biotechnology"],"title":"Effect of activated charcoal on endotoxin adsorption.
