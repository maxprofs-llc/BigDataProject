Here we present the structure of the ligand-free HIV-1-Env trimer, fix its conformation and determine its receptor interactions. Epitope analyses revealed trimeric ligand-free Env to be structurally compatible with broadly neutralizing antibodies but not poorly neutralizing ones. We coupled these compatibility considerations with binding antigenicity to engineer conformationally fixed Envs, including a 201C 433C (DS) variant specifically recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. DS-Env retained nanomolar affinity for the CD4 receptor, with which it formed an asymmetric intermediate: a closed trimer bound by a single CD4 without the typical antigenic hallmarks of CD4 induction. Antigenicity-guided structural design can thus be used both to delineate mechanism and to fix conformation, with DS-Env trimers in virus-like-particle and soluble formats providing a new generation of vaccine antigens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Young Do Kwon","Marie Pancera","Priyamvada Acharya","Ivelin S Georgiev","Emma T Crooks","Jason Gorman","M Gordon Joyce","Miklos Guttman","Xiaochu Ma","Sandeep Narpala","Cinque Soto","Daniel S Terry","Yongping Yang","Tongqing Zhou","Goran Ahlsen","Robert T Bailer","Michael Chambers","Gwo-Yu Chuang","Nicole A Doria-Rose","Aliaksandr Druz","Mark A Hallen","Adam Harned","Tatsiana Kirys","Mark K Louder","Sijy O'Dell","Gilad Ofek","Keiko Osawa","Madhu Prabhakaran","Mallika Sastry","Guillaume B E Stewart-Jones","Jonathan Stuckey","Paul V Thomas","Tishina Tittley","Constance Williams","Baoshan Zhang","Hong Zhao","Zhou Zhou","Bruce R Donald","Lawrence K Lee","Susan Zolla-Pazner","Ulrich Baxa","Arne Sch\u00f6n","Ernesto Freire","Lawrence Shapiro","Kelly K Lee","James Arthos","James B Munro","Scott C Blanchard","Walther Mothes","James M Binley","Adrian B McDermott","John R Mascola","Peter D Kwong","Do Kwon, Young","Pancera, Marie","Acharya, Priyamvada","Georgiev, Ivelin S","Crooks, Emma T","Gorman, Jason","Joyce, M Gordon","Guttman, Miklos","Ma, Xiaochu","Narpala, Sandeep","Soto, Cinque","Terry, Daniel S","Yang, Yongping","Zhou, Tongqing","Ahlsen, Goran","Bailer, Robert T","Chambers, Michael","Chuang, Gwo-Yu","Doria-Rose, Nicole A","Druz, Aliaksandr","Hallen, Mark A","Harned, Adam","Kirys, Tatsiana","Louder, Mark K","O'Dell, Sijy","Ofek, Gilad","Osawa, Keiko","Prabhakaran, Madhu","Sastry, Mallika","Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B E","Stuckey, Jonathan","Thomas, Paul V","Tittley, Tishina","Williams, Constance","Zhang, Baoshan","Zhao, Hong","Zhou, Zhou","Donald, Bruce R","Lee, Lawrence K","Zolla-Pazner, Susan","Baxa, Ulrich","Sch\u00f6n, Arne","Freire, Ernesto","Shapiro, Lawrence","Lee, Kelly K","Arthos, James","Munro, James B","Blanchard, Scott C","Mothes, Walther","Binley, James M","McDermott, Adrian B","Mascola, John R","Kwong, Peter D"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.3051","endpage":"531","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T18:37:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","phs","nigms","nhlbi","nci"],"issns":["1545-9985","1545-9993"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1435756919,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nsmb.3051.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/nsmb\/rss\/aop\/~3\/c8TYha5X9ek\/nsmb.3051","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nsmb.3051"],"pmid":"26098315","pubdate":"2015-06-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"X-ray crystallography","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Computational biology and bioinformatics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Viral membrane fusion","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"522","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Crystal structure, conformational fixation and entry-related interactions of mature ligand-free HIV-1 Env.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nsmb.3051","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-conformational-fixation-entryrelated-interactions-mature-ligandfree-hiv1-env"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5899230,"mean":6.1145522897933,"rank":206758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5692046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5899230,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191457,"mean":8.5141503426375,"rank":10691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":180737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191457,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1762,"mean":7.4849494605338,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1762,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":17.119878787879,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Ph.
