Less well-known is whether subclinical cardiac dysfunction is also a risk factor for SCD. Our objective was to assess the association between echocardiographic parameters and SCD in a community-dwelling population free of heart failure.\nWe computed hazard ratios (HRs) for left atrium diameter, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD), LV mass, qualitative LV systolic function, LV fractional shortening, and diastolic function. During a median follow-up of 6.3 years in 4,686 participants, 68 participants died due to SCD. Significant associations with SCD were observed for qualitative LV systolic function and LV fractional shortening. For moderate\/poor qualitative LV systolic function, the HR for SCD was 2.54 (95%CI 1.10;5.87). Each standard deviation decrease in LV fractional shortening was associated with a HR of 1.36 (95%CI 1.09;1.70).\nSubclinical abnormalities in left ventricular systolic function were associated with SCD risk in this general population. Although prediction of SCD remains difficult and traditional cardiovascular risk factors are of greatest importance, this knowledge might guide future directions to prevent SCD in persons with subclinical cardiac dysfunction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a02","authors":["Niemeijer, Maartje N","Leening, Maarten J G","van den Berg, Marten E","Hofman, Albert","Franco, Oscar H","Deckers, Jaap W","Rijnbeek, Peter R","Stricker, Bruno H","Eijgelsheim, Mark"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cardfail.2015.06.007","first_seen_on":"2015-06-21T16:50:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-8414"],"journal":"Journal of Cardiac Failure","last_mentioned_on":1434905390,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26093333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26093333","pubdate":"2015-06-21T22:00:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Subclinical abnormalities in echocardiographic parameters and risk of sudden cardiac death in a general population: the Rotterdam Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subclinical-abnormalities-echocardiographic-parameters-risk-sudden-cardiac-death-general-population-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5258442,"mean":6.1904978951007,"rank":4377740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5258442,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185355,"mean":8.5095480539941,"rank":149992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185355,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":408,"mean":2.7580835380835,"rank":344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":408,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.1125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
