In the literature, endometrioma has been reported in only women and there are no reports of endometrioma in animals, including non-human primates.\nA rare case of endometrioma is reported in an 11-year-old female German Shepherd with clinical signs of dehydration, anemia and prostration. Necropsy revealed ascites, generalized pallor, and a well-demarcated reddish mass adjacent to the left ovary and uterus and adherent to the retroperitoneum. The mass measured 25.0 \u00d7 20.0\u00a0cm with intermingled soft and firm areas. Upon incision, the mass was found to be solid with variable sized cystic cavities filled with coagulated blood. Microscopically, the mass was composed of cuboidal or prismatic epithelial cells arranged in tubules or acini. The epithelium of the mass had similar characteristics to the normal endometrium with PAS-positive secretions. The stroma was prominent and formed by loose connective tissue and smooth muscle fibers as confirmed by Masson trichrome. Extensive multifocal areas of hemorrhage were also observed in the stroma of the mass and in the interior of some epithelium-lined, cystic structures. Most of the epithelial cells had strong and diffuse cytokeratin expression, and some had vimentin expression. Epithelial and stromal cells also showed ER\u03b2, AR, VEGF and COX2 expression. The stroma showed areas with strong and diffuse vimentin expression. Factor VIII expression was observed only in the endothelium of blood vessels in the stroma.\nThe macroscopic, microscopic and immunohistochemical findings are consistent with an endometrioma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ad","authors":["Bruno HA Paiva","Juneo F Silva","Nat\u00e1lia M Ocarino","Cleida A Oliveira","Wiviane A Assis","Rog\u00e9ria Serakides"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13028-015-0123-1","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T15:23:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-0147"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1434813739,"links":["http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/57\/1\/31"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/pdf\/s13028-015-0123-1.pdf","pmid":"26084327","pubdate":"2015-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Veterinary Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"A rare case of endometrioma in a bitch","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rare-case-endometrioma-bitch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7399770,"mean":6.4311888600807,"rank":6404181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7399770,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223789,"mean":8.0729485763313,"rank":186590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223789,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":2.4770111731844,"rank":302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.8958333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/status\/612279315892436992","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4192593],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T15:22:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2106},"tweet_id":"612279315892436992"}]}}
