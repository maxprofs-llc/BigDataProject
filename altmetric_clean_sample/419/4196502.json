This study randomly assigned 49 first-year university women (body mass index: 20-30\u2009kg\/m(2)) to daily weight monitoring or a control condition and measured weight, mood, body dissatisfaction, and unhealthy weight control behaviors at baseline and 8\u2009weeks, and weight at 20-week follow-up. No harmful effects of daily weighing were detected; acceptability and adherence were high. Weight monitoring did not impact weight; both groups showed little weight gain. Results suggest that weight monitoring has minimal harmful effects and may be useful for preventing weight gain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Shawn N Katterman","Meghan L Butryn","Megan M Hood","Michael R Lowe","Katterman, Shawn N","Butryn, Meghan L","Hood, Megan M","Lowe, Michael R"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105315589446","endpage":"2965","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T12:48:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1483437600,"links":["http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/10\/1359105315589446.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/10\/1359105315589446.abstract","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/10\/1359105315589446?hootPostID=65ede5a97804630107235495220bea20&papetoc=","http:\/\/m.hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/10\/1359105315589446?papetoc","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/12\/2955.long","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26069272"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/10\/1359105315589446.full.pdf","pmid":"26069272","pubdate":"2015-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2955","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Daily weight monitoring as a method of weight gain prevention in healthy weight and overweight young adult women","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/daily-weight-monitoring-method-weight-gain-prevention-healthy-weight-overweight-young-adult-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.6,"score_history":{"1y":12,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8020520,"mean":6.7855598491777,"rank":484113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7536055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8020520,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228192,"mean":8.2282778374258,"rank":19050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":209106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228192,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1295,"mean":7.1207047913447,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1295,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":5.541625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
