Two hundred twenty-five dyslexic children between the ages of 7 years 6 months and 12 years 11 months whose reading skills were significantly below their intellectual capacity were enrolled in a multicenter, 36-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Children of below average intelligence, with abnormal findings on audiologic, ophthalmologic, neurologic, psychiatric, and physical examinations, who were emotionally disturbed or educationally deprived and who had recently been treated with psychoactive medication were excluded from the trial. Piracetam was well tolerated, with no serious adverse clinical or laboratory effects reported. Piracetam-treated children showed significant improvements in reading ability (Gray Oral Reading Test) and reading comprehension (Gilmore Oral Reading Test). Treatment effects were evident after 12 weeks and were sustained for the total period (36 weeks).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bef","authors":["Wilsher, C R","Bennett, D","Chase, C H","Conners, C K","DiIanni, M","Feagans, L","Hanvik, L J","Helfgott, E","Koplewicz, H","Overby, P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T15:11:14+00:00","issns":["0271-0749"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1492311278,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3305591","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3305591"],"pmid":"3305591","pubdate":"1987-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Piracetam and dyslexia: effects on reading tests.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/piracetam-dyslexia-effects-reading-tests"},"altmetric_score":{"score":26,"score_history":{"1y":23,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":26},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154346,"mean":6.8921063587504,"rank":326271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7826798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154346,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228753,"mean":8.3136291005107,"rank":12688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":216030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228753,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1833,"mean":3.0542390829694,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1833,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":2.8813235294118,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
