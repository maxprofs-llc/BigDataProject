In mammals, the IRF family includes nine members that play important roles in the immune system, oncogenesis, and apoptosis. However, the distribution and the function of IRF6 in the central nervous system are limited. In this study, we established an adult rat traumatic brain injury (TBI) model. Compared to the sham brain cortex, Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed significant upregulation of IRF6 in the ipsilateral brain cortex after TBI. Immunofluorescence double-labeling showed that IRF6 completely co-localized with neurons, not astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, we detected that the neuronal apoptosis marker active caspase-3 co-localized with IRF6 in neurons. Additionally, IRF6 knockdown in PC12 cells in vitro resulted in a decrease in active caspase-3 expression and an increase in Bcl-2 and p-Akt expression. We conclude that IRF6 might promote neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation after TBI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["Yuchang Lin","Dezhi Xu","Xiaohong Li","Chun Liu","Xia Liu","Shen Huang","Yuwei Huang","Xiaojuan Liu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10571-015-0217-3","first_seen_on":"2015-06-22T16:29:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6830"],"journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1434990535,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10571-015-0217-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10571-015-0217-3.pdf","pmid":"26077898","pubdate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Upregulation of Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 Promotes Neuronal Apoptosis After Traumatic Brain Injury in Adult Rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/upregulation-interferon-regulatory-factor-6-promotes-neuronal-apoptosis-after-traumatic-brain-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5263558,"mean":6.1954866878068,"rank":4382133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5263558,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185534,"mean":8.5024678736399,"rank":150033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185534,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":2.3842271468144,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.9204545454545,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TBIConference\/status\/613020853098315776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4197148],"posted_on":"2015-06-22T16:28:55+00:00","author":{"name":"TBI Conference","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/GuTYFiAAoT","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/659390162175070212\/nL2VByka_normal.jpg","description":"Traumatic Brain Injury, Concussion, Neuroimaging, Biomarkers, Neurorehabilitation #TBIcon","id_on_source":"TBIConference","tweeter_id":"1151615377","followers":1361},"tweet_id":"613020853098315776"}]}}
