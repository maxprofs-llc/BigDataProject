Prior studies are limited because it remains unclear whether specific AS or IU dimensions differentially relate to certain cyberchondria dimensions.\nThe present study examined associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria dimensions using a sample of community adults (N=578) located in the United States.\nAs predicted, physical AS and inhibitory IU were the only AS or IU dimensions to share unique associations with the distress cyberchondria dimension after controlling for the overlap among the AS dimensions, IU dimensions, and health anxiety. Cognitive AS and social AS unexpectedly evidenced unique associations with cyberchondria dimensions.\nThe results are limited by the cross-sectional study design and use of a community, rather than clinical, sample.\nThis study provides evidence that specific AS and IU dimensions may confer vulnerability to certain cyberchondria dimensions. Further clarifying associations among AS, IU, and cyberchondria may lead to improvements in our conceptualization and, ultimately, treatment of cyberchondria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Fergus, Thomas A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2015.06.017","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T02:55:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-0327","1573-2517"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1434768864,"links":["http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(15)00391-2\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165032715003912\/pdf","pmid":"26141807","pubdate":"2015-07-05T22:01:09+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty as potential risk Factors for cyberchondria: A Replication and extension Examining Dimensions of each construct","type":"article","volume":"184","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anxiety-sensitivity-intolerance-uncertainty-potential-risk-factors-cyberchondria-replication-extensi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5254161,"mean":6.1867553074158,"rank":3697929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":880313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5254161,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184749,"mean":8.5340244657589,"rank":129561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":35078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184749,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3123,"mean":5.1161838565022,"rank":2376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3123,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":3.801572327044,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
