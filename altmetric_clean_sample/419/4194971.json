Fat and lean mass was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; blood biochemistry was obtained for adipokines and testicular endocrine markers.\nAs compared with controls, the ALL survivors (median age 29 years, range 25-38), assessed 10-28 years after ALL diagnosis, had higher percentages of body (p < 0.05) and trunk fat mass (p < 0.05), and a lower body lean mass (p < 0.001). Survivors had significantly higher levels of leptin and adiponectin and lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3. Body fat mass and percent fat mass correlated with serum leptin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Altogether, 15% of the ALL survivors and 9% of age-matched controls were obese (BMI \u226530). Obese survivors more often had hypogonadism, had received testicular irradiation, and needed testosterone replacement therapy compared to nonobese survivors.\nAt young adulthood, long-term male ALL survivors have significantly increased body adiposity despite normal weight and BMI. Potential indicators of increased adiposity included high leptin and low SHBG levels. Serum testicular endocrine markers did not correlate with body adiposity. \u00a9 2015 S.
