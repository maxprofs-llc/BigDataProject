In the crystal, two types of [MgO6] octa-hedra, one with point group symmetry 2, share edges to build chains extending parallel to [10-1]. These chains are linked together by two kinds of phosphate tetra-hedra, HPO4 and PO4, the latter with point group symmetry 2. The three-dimensional framework delimits two different types of channels extending along [001]. One channel hosts the Na(+) cations (site symmetry 2) surrounded by eight O atoms, with Na-O bond lengths varying between 2.2974\u2005(13) and 2.922\u2005(2)\u2005\u00c5. The OH group of the HPO4 tetra-hedron points into the other type of channel and exhibits a strong hydrogen bond to an O atom of the PO4 tetra-hedron on the opposite side.","authors":["Ould Saleck, A."],"doi":"10.1107\/s205698901501155x","endpage":"815","first_seen_on":"2015-06-20T00:00:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1434758410,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S205698901501155X="],"pmcid":"PMC4518993","pmid":"26279874","pubdate":"2015-06-20T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"813","title":"Crystal structure of alluaudite-type NaMg3(HPO4)2(PO4)","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-alluauditetype-namg-3-hpo-4-2-po-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5251998,"mean":6.1864646685839,"rank":3696452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":879807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5251998,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184736,"mean":8.534302086773,"rank":129528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":35086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184736,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15876,"mean":3.4042057322835,"rank":8885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15876,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":611,"mean":3.0188295081967,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":611,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/status\/612047249842008064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4190823],"posted_on":"2015-06-20T00:00:10+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"612047249842008064"}]}}
