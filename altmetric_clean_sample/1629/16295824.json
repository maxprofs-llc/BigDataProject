The HIPC Initiative involves debt forgiveness and the redirection of funds that were meant to service external debt towards the provision of social services and poverty reduction in eligible countries. The Initiative is akin to a natural experiment since some countries benefited while some did not, and the timing of debt forgiveness varied across countries. We exploit these variations to identify the impact of HIPC Initiative on child mortality using a dynamic panel data estimator. We find that participation in HIPC Initiative is associated with statistically significant decreases in U5MR. On the other hand, the impact of actual debt cancelled is statistically insignificant.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f0","authors":["John Bosco Oryema","Kwabena Gyimah-Brempong","Gabriel Picone"],"doi":"10.1080\/17441692.2017.1287211","first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T12:13:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-1692","1744-1706"],"journal":"Global Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1486724640,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17441692.2017.1287211?ai=12l&mi=79r7c4&af=R"],"pmid":"28278752","pubdate":"2017-03-11T22:10:24+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The impact of debt relief on under five mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-debt-relief-under-five-mortality-rate-subsaharan-africa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":1558726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6608764,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266701,"mean":12.886085504312,"rank":71853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":193150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266701,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":533,"mean":5.8737368421053,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":533,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":17.775789473684,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
