Emphasis was placed on moderate-intensity noise and on the effects relevant for occupational noise exposure. It was concluded that in many respects research presents a rather inconsistent picture of these effects. Still, it is evident that the nonauditory effects of noise may be serious enough to warrant as much general attention in the occupational setting as has for some time been accorded in residential settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6033cf058f6100063e8","authors":["Kjellberg, A"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T15:30:17+00:00","issns":["0355-3140"],"journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health","last_mentioned_on":1365465600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2189217"],"pmid":"2189217","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","occupationalmedicine"],"title":"Subjective, behavioral and psychophysiological effects of noise.","type":"article","volume":"16 Suppl 1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subjective-behavioral-psychophysiological-effects-noise"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7178068,"mean":6.3139799887599,"rank":1698603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4581861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7178068,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103069,"mean":11.267328346335,"rank":32342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":68806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103069,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":849,"mean":4.2614764150943,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":849,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.67,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
