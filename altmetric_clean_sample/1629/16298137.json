Both targets are relevant for tackling several types of addiction (most notably nicotine addiction) and other compulsive behaviors. Here, we report an SAR exploration of a series of biphenyl-N-[4-[4-(2,3-substituted-phenyl)piperazine-1-yl]alkyl]carbamates, a novel class of molecules that had shown promising activities at the FAAH - D3R target combination in preliminary studies. We have rationalized the structural features conducive to activities at the main targets, and investigated activities at two off-targets: dopamine receptor subtype D2 and endocannabinoid receptor CB1. To understand the unexpected affinity for the CB1 receptor, we devised a 3D-QSAR model, which we then prospectively validated. Compound 33 was selected for PK studies because it displayed balanced affinities for the main targets and clear selectivity over the two off-targets. 33 has good stability and oral bioavailability, and can cross the blood-brain barrier.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Alessio De Simone","Debora Russo","Gian Filippo Ruda","Alessandra Micoli","Mariarosaria Ferraro","Rita Maria Concetta Di Martino","Giuliana Ottonello","Maria Summa","Andrea Armirotti","Tiziano Bandiera","Andrea Cavalli","Giovanni Bottegoni"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b01578","first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T14:32:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1486742316,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b01578"],"pmid":"28182408","pubdate":"2017-02-10T22:02:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Design, synthesis, structure-activity relationship studies, and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling of a series of O-biphenyl carbamates as dual modulators of dopamine D3 receptor and fatty acid amide hydrolase","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b01578","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-structureactivity-relationship-studies-threedimensional-quantitative-structureactiv"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":3529752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4541413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266701,"mean":12.88609367829,"rank":114797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":147444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266701,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4014,"mean":4.3956546224769,"rank":2382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4014,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":18.281672727273,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/andrearmirotti\/statuses\/830061714431410178","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16298137],"posted_on":"2017-02-10T14:31:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrea Armirotti","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/773416391454126081\/9y4kWREr_normal.jpg","description":"Head of Analytical Chemistry\nIstituto Italiano di Tecnologia","id_on_source":"andrearmirotti","tweeter_id":"773410395310678016","geo":{"lt":44.40632,"ln":8.93386,"country":"IT"},"followers":33},"tweet_id":"830061714431410178"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ManoPensante\/statuses\/830083557573947392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16298137],"posted_on":"2017-02-10T15:58:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Giovanni Bottegoni","url":"http:\/\/scholar.google.it\/citations?user=OZeKSfwAAAAJ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2424408376\/giovanni_bottegoni_2011_normal.jpg","description":"Qui ci vuole la Mano Pe(n)sante...","id_on_source":"ManoPensante","tweeter_id":"711940566","geo":{"lt":43.82036,"ln":13.01206,"country":"IT"},"followers":42},"tweet_id":"830083557573947392"}]}}
