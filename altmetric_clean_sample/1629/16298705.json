Repeated arterial pressure measurements during pregnancy were averaged within the second and third trimesters, respectively. Multivariable regression models estimated associations between second to third trimester changes in arterial pressure and small-for-gestational-age birth weight, fat mass, fat-free mass and percent body fat.\nA greater second to third trimester increase in maternal arterial pressure was associated with greater odds of small-for-gestational-age birth weight. Greater increases in maternal diastolic blood pressure were associated with reductions in offspring percent body fat (-1.1% in highest vs lowest quartile of increase, 95% confidence interval: -1.9%, -0.3%).\nMid-to-late pregnancy increases in maternal arterial pressure, which do not meet clinical thresholds for hypertension are associated with neonatal body size and composition.Journal of Perinatology advance online publication, 9 February 2017; doi:10.1038\/jp.2016.261.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb2","authors":["A P Starling","A L B Shapiro","K A Sauder","J L Kaar","B M Ringham","D H Glueck","H L Galan","D Dabelea"],"doi":"10.1038\/jp.2016.261","first_seen_on":"2017-02-10T15:01:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["0743-8346","1476-5543"],"journal":"Journal of Perinatology","last_mentioned_on":1486839479,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/jp\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/jp2016261a.html?WT.feed_name=subjects_epidemiology"],"pmid":"28181996","pubdate":"2017-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Pre-eclampsia","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["perinatology"],"title":"Blood pressure during pregnancy, neonatal size and altered body composition: the Healthy Start study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/jp.2016.261","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-pressure-during-pregnancy-neonatal-size-altered-body-composition-healthy-start-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":5928747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1972844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266396,"mean":12.895190375194,"rank":178777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":73402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266396,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1073,"mean":6.8353507462687,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1073,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.8464285714286,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
