In this study we report the results of using fresh frozen amniotic membrane grafts (AMG) after wide excision of potentially malignant lesions.MethodsRetrospective review of 53 patients; between January 2011 and April 2014. Conjunctival lesions were excised with a non-touch technique (2\u2009mm margin) and sent for histopathological analysis. The surgical margins were treated with cryotherapy and a fresh frozen AMG was used to cover the defect. The main features examined were for any signs of recurrence, the conjunctivalisation of the AMG, complications and cosmetic appearance.ResultsFifty-three patients; 35 males and 18 females. Mean age was 54.9 (range 19-88). The mean follow up to January 2015 for all lesions was 21.4 months (range 8-48 months). The most common lesions were invasive malignant melanoma. There were no local surgical complications in 77.3% of patients; minimal scarring (11.3%), symblepharon (11.3%), and granuloma (7.5%). Five patients with conjunctival melanoma developed in-transit metastasis and orbital extension, none of it was at the site of the AMG.ConclusionOur case series is the largest reported to date, with the largest number of melanomas. The use of fresh frozen AMG has improved the local surgical outcomes by improving healing and reducing scarring as well as allowing for a wider surgical margin.Eye advance online publication, 17
