We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to assess depressive symptoms and probable major depression. We investigated pre-event and time-varying predictors of depressive symptoms.\nWe identified 4 trajectories: resistant (22.6% of sample), resilient (37.0%), mild depressive symptoms (32.5%), and persistent moderate depression (8.0%). Baseline predictors that appeared to protect against persistent moderate depression included higher household income (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20090.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.06, 0.56), greater psychological resilience (OR\u2009=\u20090.63; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.48, 0.82), more family harmony (OR\u2009=\u20090.68; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.56, 0.83), higher family support (OR\u2009=\u20090.80; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.69, 0.92), better self-rated health (OR\u2009=\u20090.28; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.16, 0.49), and fewer depressive symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20090.59; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.43, 0.81).\nDepression trajectories after a major protest are comparable to those after major population events. Health care professionals should be aware of the mental health consequences during and after social movements, particularly among individuals lacking social support. (Am J Public Health.
