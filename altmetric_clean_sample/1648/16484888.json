We have typed 36 Algerian Type 1 diabetic probands and their families using DQA1 and DQB1 oligonucleotide probes. Fifty-nine parental haplotypes non transmitted to diabetic offspring served as controls. The frequencies of DQA1 and DQB1 alleles and haplotypes and their associations with Type 1 diabetes were, except minor differences, similar to those reported in French. Susceptibility DQA1 (Arg52+) and DQB1 (Asp57-) alleles were significantly increased among patients versus controls (90% vs 53%, RR = 8.4, p < 10(-6), and 94% vs 64%, RR = 9.4, p < 10(-5), respectively). 85% of Type 1 diabetics versus 34% of control haplotypes were either DR3DQw2 or DR4DQw8 susceptibility haplotypes (DQA1 Arg52+, DQB1 Asp57-) (RR = 10.8, p < 10(-7). 75% of the probands vs 14% of the controls (RR = 18, p < 10(-5)) and 73% of affected siblings versus 24% of unaffected siblings (RR = 8.4, p < 0.02) possessed a genotype composed of these two susceptibility haplotypes in the homozygous or heterozygous state. 42% of the probands were DR3DQw2\/DR4DQw8, corresponding to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The lack of excess of heterozygotes could be due to the consanguine families in this sample, as among the patients with consanguine parents the frequency of DR3, 4 heterozygotes was lower (27% vs 48% in non-consanguine patients, NS) and that of DR3 homozygotes increased (45% vs 12%, respectively, p < 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccdf","authors":["Beressi, J P","Djoulah, S","Khalil, I","Benhamamouch, S","Bessaoud, K","Touhami, M","Hors, J","Deschamps, I"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-17T13:06:01+00:00","issns":["0338-1684"],"issue":"6","journal":"Diab\u00e8te m\u00e9tabolisme","last_mentioned_on":1487336747,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1297602"],"pmid":"1297602","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"HLA DQA1 and DQB1 study in Algerian type 1 diabetes families.","type":"article","volume":"18"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4373704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2282993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238228,"mean":13.880454784722,"rank":138894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":76602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238228,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.8233333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mohamed_harkat\/statuses\/832576779047034880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16484888],"posted_on":"2017-02-17T13:05:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Mohamed HARKAT","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/455608845197266944\/smN5miQX_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"mohamed_harkat","tweeter_id":"85088427","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":238},"tweet_id":"832576779047034880"}]}}
