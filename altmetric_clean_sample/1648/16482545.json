Human keratinocytes from a single donor treated with or without UVR were analyzed by RNA-seq, exome-seq, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq at 4\u2009h and 72\u2009h following UVR. Compared to the relatively moderate mutagenic effects of UVR, acute UV exposure induced substantial epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations, illuminating a previously underappreciated role of epigenomic and transcriptomic instability in skin pathogenesis. Integration of the multi-omics data revealed that UVR-induced transcriptional dysregulation of a subset of genes was attributable to either genetic mutations or global redistribution of H3K27ac. H3K27ac redistribution further led to the formation of distinctive super enhancers in UV-irradiated cells. Our analysis also identified several new UV target genes, including CYP24A1, GJA5, SLAMF7 and ETV1, which were frequently dysregulated in human squamous cell carcinomas, highlighting their potential as new molecular targets for prevention or treatment of UVR-induced skin cancers. Taken together, our concurrent multi-omics analyses provide new mechanistic insights into the complex molecular networks underlying UV photobiological effects, which have important implications in understanding its impact on skin homeostasis and pathogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Yao Shen","Milda Stanislauskas","Gen Li","Deyou Zheng","Liang Liu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep42646","first_seen_on":"2017-02-17T11:11:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","niams"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1487523354,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep42646?WT.feed_name=subjects_cancer&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28211524\/"],"pmid":"28211524","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Squamous cell carcinoma","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Gene expression profiling","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Gene regulation","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Epigenetic and genetic dissections of UV-induced global gene dysregulation in skin cells through multi-omics analyses","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep42646","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-genetic-dissections-uvinduced-global-gene-dysregulation-skin-cells-through-multiomics-ana"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":6255902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1113076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241383,"mean":13.726682138684,"rank":176524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":39744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241383,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35140,"mean":14.790110020206,"rank":25470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":5687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35140,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3773,"mean":16.665856839873,"rank":2680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3773,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
