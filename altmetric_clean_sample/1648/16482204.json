The objectives of our study were to assess perceived stress among undergraduate medical students and to find out academic factors as determinants. A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was carried out among undergraduate medical students of R. G. Kar Medical College, India, during July 2011-June 2012. Perceived stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale-14. A 10-item questionnaire was used to assess academic sources of stress and their severity. The overall mean perceived stress score was 29.58 (standard deviation [SD] = 6.60), and 46.3% of the participants were in the group of more stressed (perceived stress score \u226528). The academic stressor factors predicted 78% of variability of perceived stress. A higher level of perceived stress was reported by the students. The students should be taught different stress management techniques to improve their ability to cope with a demanding professional course.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007757","authors":["Chowdhury","Ranadip Chowdhury","Abhijit Mukherjee","Kaushik Mitra","Somnath Naskar","Prasanta Ray Karmakar","Saibendu Kumar Lahiri"],"doi":"10.4103\/0019-557x.200253","first_seen_on":"2017-02-17T10:40:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0019-557X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1487327738,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijph.in\/article.asp?issn=0019-557X;year=2017;volume=61;issue=1;spage=55;epage=57;aulast=Chowdhury#.WKbR0wrwmaM.linkedin","http:\/\/www.ijph.in\/article.asp?issn=0019-557X%3Byear%3D2017%3Bvolume%3D61%3Bissue%3D1%3Bspage%3D55%3Bepage%3D57%3Baulast%3DChowdhury#.WKbR7kcic7E.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijph.in\/article.asp?issn=0019-557X;year=2017;volume=61;issue=1;spage=55;epage=57;aulast=Chowdhury;type=2","pmid":"28218165","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Perceived psychological stress among undergraduate medical students: Role of academic factors","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceived-psychological-stress-among-undergraduate-medical-students-role-academic-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238228,"mean":13.88044324111,"rank":199823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238228,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":2.9828695652174,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/832538862945726464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16482204],"posted_on":"2017-02-17T10:35:07+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
