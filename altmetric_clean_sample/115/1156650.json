The author concludes by describing how he felt when reading the case and uses this to illustrate how clinicians may benefit by assessing their feelings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a14","authors":["Howe EG"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-06T01:50:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Clinical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1357437006,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23256399"],"pmid":"23256399","pubdate":"2012-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"An ethical priority greater than life itself.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethical-priority-greater-life-itself"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3551120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283342,"mean":5.9520295192012,"rank":228927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283342,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":3.7692470588235,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.3409090909091,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
