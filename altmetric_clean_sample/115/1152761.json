Almost 20% of these students begin taking a series of courses specified by advisers of health preprofessionals. The single most important influence on health profession advisers and on course selection for this huge population of learners is the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), which was last revised in 1991, 10 years before publication of the first draft human genome sequence. In preparation for the 2015 MCAT, there is a broad discussion among stakeholders of how best to revise undergraduate and medical education in the molecular sciences to prepare researchers and doctors to acquire, analyze and use individual genomic and metabolomic data in the coming decades. Getting these changes right is among the most important educational problems of our era.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f61000611e","authors":["Brenner, Charles"],"doi":"10.1002\/bmb.20653","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2013-01-03T18:03:55+00:00","issns":["1539-3429","1470-8175"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Education","last_mentioned_on":1382881318,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23281187?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/bmb.20653","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23281187","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmb.20653\/abstract;jsessionid=E105F3C409FF149F8FD2EF6BDAC0910A.d02t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bmb.20653\/pdf","pmid":"23281187","pubdate":"2012-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["molecularbiology","education","biochemistry"],"title":"Changes in chemistry and biochemistry education: Creative responses to medical college admissions test revisions in the age of the genome.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-chemistry-biochemistry-education-creative-responses-medical-college-admissions-test-revision"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6710513,"mean":6.1614211824654,"rank":1336380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5335133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6710513,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288622,"mean":6.4410207642549,"rank":67178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":220249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288622,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305,"mean":2.5178026315789,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.6511333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
