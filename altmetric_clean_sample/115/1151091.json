Lettuce seeds were inoculated at a high level with two Salmonella enterica and two Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains each (\u00b18 log\u2081\u2080 CFU\/g seed) and the survival of the pathogens was monitored over two years using standard plating techniques on selective medium. The Salmonella strains (serovars Typhimurium and Thompson) survived significantly better on the seeds than the E. coli O157:H7 strains (MB3885 and NCTC12900). When individual seeds were tested two years after inoculation, Salmonella was recovered from each individual seed, whereas E. coli O157:H7 only from 4% to 14% of the seeds, depending on the recovery method. When contaminated stored seeds were germinated and the seedlings examined for presence of the pathogens, it was clear that both pathogens were able to proliferate on the seedlings. Pathogen counts up to 5.92 log\u2081\u2080 CFU and 4.41 log\u2081\u2080 CFU per positive seedling were observed for Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7, respectively. Our study not only confirms the long-term survival of enteric pathogens on seeds but also shows that the pathogens maintain their ability to resuscitate and proliferate on the seedlings. Seeds or seedlings should be considered as contamination sources for the cultivation of leafy vegetables such as butterhead lettuce grown in greenhouses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Inge Van der Linden","Bart Cottyn","Mieke Uyttendaele","Geertrui Vlaemynck","Martine Maes","Marc Heyndrickx","Van der Linden I","Cottyn B","Uyttendaele M","Vlaemynck G","Maes M","Heyndrickx M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.12.015","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T19:41:25+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-3235345","handles":["1854\/LU-3235345"],"issns":["01681605","0168-1605"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1357155679,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0168160512006563","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.12.015"],"pmid":"23334101","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Long-term survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica on butterhead lettuce seeds, and their subsequent survival and growth on the seedlings","type":"article","volume":"161","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-survival-escherichia-coli-o157-h7-salmonella-enterica-butterhead-lettuce-seeds-subsequent-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628216,"mean":4.9435109727551,"rank":2904315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628216,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278788,"mean":5.748867544039,"rank":222702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278788,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":755,"mean":2.1450530503979,"rank":467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":755,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.675,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/env_micro\/statuses\/286557804402180097","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1151091],"posted_on":"2013-01-02T19:41:19+00:00","author":{"name":"env_micro","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"env_micro","tweeter_id":"528144428","followers":1},"tweet_id":"286557804402180097"}]}}
