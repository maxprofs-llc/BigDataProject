There are few studies investigating non-pharmacological treatments for RLS, such as physical therapy and\/or peripheral neural mobilization. The traction straight leg raise (tSLR) technique is one such mobilization that may affect central and peripheral neural pathways and reduce RLS symptoms. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a tSLR on the symptoms associated with RLS. A cohort of fifteen people was enrolled. Thirteen subjects (11 female) between the ages of 32-64 completed the study. Subjects completed two questionnaires to quantify their severity of RLS before treatment was initiated and at the final session. These measures included: the Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (RLSRS) 0-40, an RLS Ordinal Scale, and a Global Rating of Change (GROC) assessments (-7, 0, +7). Patients were treated with tSLR bilaterally for four total visits on days 1, 3, 8, and 15. Results indicated an RLSRS pre-treatment average of 24.8 (severe) and post-treatment average of 9.2 (mild), representing a 63% improvement from baseline (p < 0.05). Ten of 13 subjects reported a GROC of +4 or higher at the final session, indicating at least a moderate improvement in patient status from baseline. Our results indicate that following a series of tSLR treatments symptoms were reduced in individuals with idiopathic RLS. A prospective, randomized controlled trial is necessary to evaluate the potential for a tSLR to effectively manage idiopathic RLS symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b0f","authors":["Stevens-Lapsley, Jennifer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.math.2012.11.002","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T16:26:52+00:00","issns":["1356-689X"],"journal":"Manual Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1399517504,"links":["http:\/\/www.manualtherapyjournal.com\/article\/PIIS1356689X12002457\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23276629\/?i=2&from=neural%20and%20mobilization%20and%20manual%20therapy","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23276629?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.manualtherapyjournal.com\/article\/S1356-689X(12)00245-7\/pdf","pmid":"23276629","pubdate":"2013-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Management of symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome with use of a traction straight leg raise: A preliminary case series","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-symptoms-restless-legs-syndrome-ofatractionstraight-leg-raise-preliminary-case-series"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229091,"mean":5.9655632456766,"rank":783534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5443993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229091,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268354,"mean":6.6474449400605,"rank":43364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":224904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268354,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":978,"mean":8.2788147389969,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":978,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":8.0515625,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"ES":3,"ZA":1,"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/JamesMarvinBlog\/status\/286506608761118720","license":"public","citation_ids":[1150820],"posted_on":"2013-01-02T16:17:53+00:00","author":{"name":"James Marvin","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000063011351\/6c9b31d2a31a799259fee9617a90c1a9_normal.jpeg","description":"Run, Gym, Blade, keen advocate of banter and laughs.
