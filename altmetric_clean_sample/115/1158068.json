The main source of MeHg exposure is seafood consumption, including many marine species harvested from the global oceans. Fish, birds and other wildlife are also susceptible to the impacts of MeHg and already exceed toxicological thresholds in vulnerable regions like the Arctic. Most future emissions scenarios project a growth or stabilization of anthropogenic mercury releases relative to present-day levels. At these emissions levels, inputs of mercury to ecosystems are expected to increase substantially in the future, in part due to growth in the legacy reservoirs of mercury in oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems. Seawater mercury concentration trajectories in areas such as the North Pacific Ocean that supply large quantities of marine fish to the global seafood market are projected to increase by more than 50% by 2050. Fish mercury levels and subsequent human and biological exposures are likely to also increase because production of MeHg in ocean ecosystems is driven by the supply of available inorganic mercury, among other factors. Analyses that only consider changes in primary anthropogenic emissions are likely to underestimate the severity of future deposition and concentration increases associated with growth in mercury reservoirs in the land and ocean. We therefore recommend that future policy analyses consider the fully coupled interactions among short and long-lived reservoirs of mercury in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial ecosystems. Aggressive anthropogenic emission reductions are needed to reduce MeHg exposures and associated health impacts on humans and wildlife and protect the integrity of one of the last wild-food sources globally. In the near-term, public health advice on safe fish consumption choices such as smaller species, younger fish, and harvests from relatively unpolluted ecosystems is needed to minimize exposure risks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cd3cf058f610000558","authors":["Sunderland EM","Selin NE","Elsie M Sunderland","Noelle E Selin"],"doi":"10.1186\/1476-069x-12-2","first_seen_on":"2013-01-07T12:19:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-069X",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source","last_mentioned_on":1361548047,"links":["http:\/\/www.ehjournal.net\/content\/12\/1\/2\/abstract"],"pmid":"23289850","pubdate":"2013-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Future trends in environmental mercury concentrations: implications for prevention strategies","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ehjournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1476-069X-12-2","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/future-trends-environmental-mercury-concentrations-implications-prevention-strategies-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":19.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":19.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6792010,"mean":6.1779220051078,"rank":320355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6471705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6792010,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290022,"mean":6.425931232566,"rank":17257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":272733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290022,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":714,"mean":13.168805049088,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":714,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":9.8344,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":8,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"CA":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/LizHoffmanbmc\/status\/288303363437764609","rt":["GHWindow"],"citation_ids":[1158068],"posted_on":"2013-01-07T15:17:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Liz Hoffman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1923084945\/Liz_H_normal.JPG","description":"I'm a Journal Development Manager at BioMed Central working on health services research and policy.
