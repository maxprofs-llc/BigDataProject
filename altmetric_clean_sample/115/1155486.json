However, the mechanisms involved in these renal changes are not well known. Our objective was to evaluate the role of angiotensin II and 5-lipooxygenase-derived metabolites in the renal effects induced by prolonged COX-2 inhibition when sodium intake is low. Conscious dogs were treated during 7 days with a COX-2 inhibitor (1 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d, SC75416), and either a vehicle, an AT1 receptor antagonist (0.4 mg \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d, candesartan) or a selective 5-lipooxygenase inhibitor (PF-150, 20 and 60 mg \u00b7 kg \u00b7 d). The administration of SC75416 alone induced significant changes in renal blood flow (219 \u00b1 14 to 160 \u00b1 10 mL\/min), glomerular filtration rate (51 \u00b1 2 to 42 \u00b1 3 mL\/min), and plasma potassium (pK) (4.3 \u00b1 0.1 to 4.6 \u00b1 0.1 mEq\/L). Similar decrements in renal blood flow (27%) and glomerular filtration rate (20%) and a similar increment in pK (7%) were found when SC75416 was administered in candesartan-pretreated dogs. However, SC75416 administration did not elicit significant changes in renal hemodynamics and pK in dogs pretreated with each dose of PF-150. Our data suggest that leukotrienes but not angiotensin II are involved in the renal effects induced by COX-2 inhibition when sodium intake is low.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0b013e31828399ae","first_seen_on":"2013-01-05T03:02:01+00:00","issns":["0160-2446"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1378500088,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Leukotrienes,_But_Not_Angiotensin_II,_Are_Involved.99255.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Abstract\/2013\/04000\/Leukotrienes,_But_Not_Angiotensin_II,_Are_Involved.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/Leukotrienes,_But_Not_Angiotensin_II,_Are_Involved.99255.pdf","pmid":"23288201","pubdate":"2013-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"","subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"Leukotrienes, But Not Angiotensin II, Are Involved in the Renal Effects Elicited by the Prolonged Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibition When Sodium Intake Is Low","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leukotrienes-not-angiotensin-ii-involved-renal-effects-elicited-prolonged-cyclooxygenase2-inhibition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3080282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":961058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283512,"mean":5.9407144273062,"rank":194341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283512,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":1.6562391304348,"rank":562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.1612068965517,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JofCVPonline\/statuses\/325458235047952384","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1155486],"posted_on":"2013-04-20T03:57:44+00:00","author":{"name":"JofCVPharmacology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611389347\/JCVPharma_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: Michael R.
