However, this can be a significant social problem and it may complicate psychiatric disorders like the anxiety states. We are reporting here, a case of the prolonged abuse of multiple gastrointestinal antibiotics like metronidazole, mebendazole and albendazole. The patient had fortunately not developed any overt toxicity from the overuse of these drugs. He was diagnosed with the generalized anxiety disorder with the anankastic personality disorder. He responded favourably to paroxetine and is being maintained on psychotherapy. As far as we know, this is probably the first report of this kind of abuse from India.","abstract_source":"pubmed","doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2012\/4443.2568","first_seen_on":"2013-01-04T21:01:39+00:00","issns":["2249-782X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1357333280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23285465?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23285465","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The abuse of multiple gastrointestinal antibiotics: a case report.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abuse-multiple-gastrointestinal-antibiotics-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
