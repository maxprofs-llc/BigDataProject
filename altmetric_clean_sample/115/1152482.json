Here we compare pDC from human MLN and peripheral blood (PB) by phenotype and function. MLN from patients with or without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) undergoing colon surgery and PB from patients with IBD and from controls were used to isolate mononuclear cells. The pDC were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CCR6, CCR7, CX3CR1, CD103 and HLA-DR. Purified pDC from MLN and PB were stimulated with staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), CpG-A, interleukin-3 (IL-3), SEB + IL-3, CpG-A + IL-3 or left unstimulated, and cultured alone or with purified allogeneic CD4(+) CD45RA(+) HLA-DR- T cells. Subsequently, concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), IFN-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in culture supernatants were determined by multiplex bead array. The PB pDC from IBD patients exhibited an activated and matured phenotype whereas MLN pDC and control PB pDC were less activated. CpG-A and CpG-A + IL-3-stimulated MLN pDC secreted less IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 compared with PB pDC from controls. Compared with co-cultures of naive CD4 T cells with PB pDC, co-cultures with MLN pDC contained more IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with SEB and SEB + IL-3, and less IFN-\u03b1 when stimulated with CpG-A. MLN pDC differ phenotypically from PB pDC and their pattern of cytokine secretion and may contribute to specific outcomes of mucosal immune reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a99","doi":"10.1111\/imm.12060","first_seen_on":"2013-01-03T16:19:26+00:00","issns":["1365-2567"],"journal":"Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1357229947,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23278129"],"pmid":"23278129","pubdate":"2012-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Dendritic cells from human mesenteric lymph nodes in inflammatory and non-inflammatory bowel diseases: subsets and function of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dendritic-cells-human-mesenteric-lymph-nodes-inflammatory-noninflammatory-bowel-diseases-subsets-fun"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3077694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":956455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283529,"mean":5.952168597105,"rank":192929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283529,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":2.3516323296355,"rank":421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":3.484693877551,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
