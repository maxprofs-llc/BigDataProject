The advances in proteomics technology, especially quantitative proteomics, have stimulated a great interest in applying this technology for pancreatic cancer study. A variety of tissue proteomics approaches have been applied to investigate pancreatic cancer and the associated diseases. These studies were carried out with various goals, aiming to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying pancreatic tumorigenesis, to improve therapeutic treatment and to identify cancer associated protein signatures, signaling events as well as interactions between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Here, we provide an overview on the tissue proteomics studies of pancreatic cancer reported in the past few years in light of discovery and technology development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008649","authors":["Pan S","Brentnall TA","Kelly K","Chen R","Pan, Sheng","Brentnall, Teresa A.","Kelly, Kimberly","Chen, Ru"],"doi":"10.1002\/pmic.201200319","endpage":"721","first_seen_on":"2013-01-07T12:22:03+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1615-9861","1615-9853"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"PROTEOMICS","last_mentioned_on":1357627163,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pmic.201200319\/abstract;jsessionid=3C116E94C339598AAD819722B1064315.d03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/pmic.201200319&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pmic.201200319\/pdf","pmid":"23125171","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"710","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Tissue proteomics in pancreatic cancer study: Discovery, emerging technologies, and challenges","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tissue-proteomics-pancreatic-cancer-study-discovery-emerging-technologies-challenges"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6404240,"mean":5.8590585616824,"rank":2819020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3412365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6404240,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293583,"mean":6.2949684040576,"rank":132569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":150479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293583,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1790,"mean":2.5678882057015,"rank":715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1790,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":1.63905,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
