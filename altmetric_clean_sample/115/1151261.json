Recent data show a deleterious relationship between low circulating sodium levels and bone mass, and relative or absolute hyponatremia is a known complication of anorexia nervosa. Clinical studies of other medical conditions associated with hyponatremia suggest that detrimental effects of low sodium levels on health are seen even within the normal range. We hypothesized that women with anorexia nervosa and relatively low plasma sodium levels would have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than those with higher plasma sodium levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bee","authors":["Lawson EA","Fazeli PK","Calder G","Putnam H","Misra M","Meenaghan E","Miller KK","Klibanski A","Elizabeth A.
