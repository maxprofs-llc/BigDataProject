In clinical practice some of the IS patients present with positive familial history of the deformity and some do not. Traditionally about 90% of patients have been considered as sporadic cases without familial recurrence. However the exact proportion of Familial and Sporadic Idiopathic Scoliosis is still unknown. Housekeeping genes encode proteins that are usually essential for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. ACTB and GAPDH are two housekeeping genes encoding respectively a cytoskeletal protein \u03b2-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of glycolysis. Although their expression levels can fluctuate between different tissues and persons, human housekeeping genes seem to exhibit a preserved tissue-wide expression ranking order. It was hypothesized that expression ranking order of two representative housekeeping genes ACTB and GAPDH might be disturbed in the tissues of patients with Familial Idiopathic Scoliosis (with positive family history of idiopathic scoliosis) opposed to the patients with no family members affected (Sporadic Idiopathic Scoliosis). An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed that could serve to differentiate between familial and sporadic cases of idiopathic scoliosis based on the expression levels of ACTB and GAPDH in different tissues of scoliotic patients. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the expression levels of ACTB and GAPDH in different tissues of idiopathic scoliosis patients could be used as a source of data for specially developed artificial neural network in order to predict the positive family history of index patient.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e2","authors":["Tomasz Waller","Roman Nowak","Magdalena Tkacz","Damian Zapart","Urszula Mazurek"],"doi":"10.1186\/1475-925x-12-1","first_seen_on":"2013-01-04T17:16:20+00:00","issns":["1475-925X"],"issue":"1","journal":"BioMedical Engineering OnLine","last_mentioned_on":1357319099,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedical-engineering-online.com\/content\/12\/1\/1\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3599878\/ | title=Familial or Sporadic Idiopathic Scoliosis \u2013 classification based on artificial neural network and GAPDH and ACTB transcription profile | last=Tomasz Waller, Roman Nowak, Magdalena Tkacz, Damian Zapart, and Urszula Mazurek | first= | work= | publisher= | date=4 January 2013| archive-url=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170621142014\/https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3599878\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3599878\/ | title=Familial or Sporadic Idiopathic Scoliosis \u2013 classification based on artificial neural network and GAPDH and ACTB transcription profile | last=Tomasz Waller, Roman Nowak, Magdalena Tkacz, Damian Zapart, and Urszula Mazurek | first= | work=Biomed.
