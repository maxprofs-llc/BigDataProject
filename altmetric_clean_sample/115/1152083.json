Although their diagnostic accuracy is precise, the preparation of the leukocytes is both laborious and potentially hazardous for laboratory personnel. Molecules involved in leukocyte migration (homing-associated molecules) could serve as targets for the development of imaging agents for inflammation. An excellent target would be a molecule that is absent or expressed at low levels in healthy tissues, but is present or upregulated at the sites of inflammation. In this paper, we will review the literature concerning the use of homing-associated molecules as imaging targets. We will especially concentrate on vascular adhesion protein-1 due to the promising results regarding its use as a target for the imaging of inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000809","doi":"10.1186\/2191-219x-3-1","first_seen_on":"2013-01-03T11:43:42+00:00","issns":["2191-219X"],"issue":"1","journal":"EJNMMI Research","last_mentioned_on":1357207977,"links":["http:\/\/www.ejnmmires.com\/content\/3\/1\/1\/abstract"],"pmid":"23281702","pubdate":"2013-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"1","title":"Nuclear imaging of inflammation: homing-associated molecules as targets","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nuclear-imaging-inflammation-homingassociated-molecules-targets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2898089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278946,"mean":5.7276297477998,"rank":222112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278946,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":0.6037037037037,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.72222222222222,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
