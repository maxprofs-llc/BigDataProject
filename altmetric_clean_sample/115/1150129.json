Consistent with this hypothesis anti-brain antibodies were detected in sera of children with OCD and\/or Tourette's syndrome. In the present study, we tested whether adults with OCD have anti-brain antibodies or other antibodies that serve as markers of autoimmunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Maina G","Albert U","Bogetto F","Borghese C","Berro AC","Mutani R","Rossi F","Vigliani MC"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2008.11.019","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T04:44:09+00:00","issns":["0165-0327"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1357101841,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19138800"],"pmid":"19138800","pubdate":"2009-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Anti-brain antibodies in adult patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibrain-antibodies-adult-patients-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":2018626,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278771,"mean":5.7585760160708,"rank":149607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79060,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278771,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2076,"mean":4.2408771084337,"rank":1308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2076,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":3.3310924369748,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
