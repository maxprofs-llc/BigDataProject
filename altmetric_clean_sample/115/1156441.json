The results showed: (1) The plasma acid model changed. Lysine increases and arginine decreases, due to hypothermia. Hypercapnia imbalance of acid and alkali and changes of hepatic dysfunction etc. (2) The prognosis of respiratory failure as well as its severity was judged according to the decreasing extent of arginine and BCAA. The more worse the condition of the disease, the more lowering of the level of arginine and BCAA. (3) The changes of blood gas analysis and hepatic dysfunction may effect on the metabolism of plasma amino acid in some degree. (4) Hypoxemia in infected patients with respiratory failure may cause peripheral deficit of energy. We suggested that patients should be given BCAA and arginine for more energy as anti-infection and oxygen therapy were used.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd08","authors":["Pan, Z"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-05T20:34:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1001-0939"],"issue":"3","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","last_mentioned_on":1354712400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1913967"],"pmid":"1913967","pubdate":"1991-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[The determination and evaluation of the plasma amino acid in respiratory failure].","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-evaluation-plasma-amino-acid-respiratory-failure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629283,"mean":4.9355109985986,"rank":2901334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629283,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278886,"mean":5.7379032504437,"rank":222503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278886,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":0.8491935483871,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis: p...
