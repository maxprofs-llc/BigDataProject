Response levels were defined as percent decreases from baseline in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score after 6 weeks of treatment, with a \u2264 25% decrease for minimal, > 25 to < 50% decrease for partial, \u2265 50% to < 75% decrease for moderate, and \u2265 75% decrease for a robust response to treatment.Results: More patients receiving adjunctive aripiprazole exhibited a partial (23.9% vs 17.9%, P = .017), moderate (23.1% vs 15.0%, P < .001), and robust response (14.3% vs 7.4%, P < .001) compared with adjunctive placebo. Adjunctive aripiprazole treatment compared with adjunctive placebo treatment was associated with a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving an early response (week 2, \u2265 50% reduction in MADRS total score, n = 110\/539 vs n = 47\/525, P < .001, number needed to treat = 9) and an endpoint response (relative risk = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.4-2.0, P < .001, number needed to treat = 7). A univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an early response was a significant predictor of endpoint remission (P < .001).Conclusions: Aripiprazole augmentation was associated with a significantly greater proportion of patients achieving a partial, moderate, or robust response to treatment compared with ADT alone. Patients showing an early response (week 2) to augmentation maintained their response through endpoint, suggesting that clinicians may make clinically meaningful decisions early during treatment.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00095823, NCT00095758, and NCT00105196.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc75","authors":["Casey DE","Laubmeier KK","Marler SV","Forbes RA","Baker RA"],"doi":"10.4088\/pcc.11m01251","first_seen_on":"2013-01-04T07:08:04+00:00","issns":["2155-7772"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Primary Care Companion to CNS Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1357283279,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23106023"],"pmcid":"PMC3466032","pmid":"23106023","pubdate":"2012-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Efficacy of adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder: a pooled response quartile analysis and the predictive value of week 2 early response.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-adjunctive-aripiprazole-major-depressive-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2015229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278868,"mean":5.7252502805998,"rank":149131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278868,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":2.9448761904762,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.518875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/senjyutupsychop\/statuses\/287092999840731136","license":"public","citation_ids":[1153756],"posted_on":"2013-01-04T07:07:59+00:00","author":{"name":"senjyutupsychopharm","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2058221367\/gehtr_normal.png","description":"\u5168\u3066\u306f\u6226\u8853\u9b42\u306e\u30df\u30ea\u30aa\u30bf\u30fb\u7cbe\u795e\u79d1\u85ac\u5264\u5e2b\u3067\u3059\u3002\r\n\u4ed9\u53f0\u304b\u3089\u96e2\u308c\u3066\u3082\u3001\u5e38\u306b\u9b42\u306f\u30d9\u30ac\u30eb\u30bf\u3068\u5171\u306b\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\u6545\u90f7\u306e\u516b\u6238\u3068\u65e5\u672c\u3092\u611b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\r\n\u7cbe\u795e\u85ac\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u6226\u4e89\u6620\u753b\u3001\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u95a2\u4fc2\u306e\u30c4\u30a4\u30fc\u30c8\u5927\u76ee\u3067\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"senjyutupsychop","tweeter_id":"547670484","followers":117},"tweet_id":"287092999840731136"}]}}
