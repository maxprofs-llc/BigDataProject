Traditionally, the approach has been conservative followed by interval appendicectomy. A survey was distributed to 117 surgeons (100 consultants and 17 final year specialist registrars) to determine how the appendix mass is currently treated in Ireland. In total, 70 surgeons responded. 51 (73%) adopt a conservative approach initially. 48 (68%) favoured interval appendicectomy at six weeks after a period of successful conservative management. 34 (49%) gave risk of recurrence as the reason for performing interval appendicectomy and 16 (22%) would perform interval appendicectomy in order to obtain histological analysis to outrule caecal or appendiceal neoplasm. 44 (63%) opted for a laparoscopic rather than an open approach for interval appendicectomy. No consensus exists in Ireland for management of the appendix mass presenting acutely. The present series demonstrates a trend towards conservative approach initially followed by interval appendicectomy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a8f","authors":["Irfan M","Hogan AM","Gately R","Lowery AJ","Waldron R","Khan W","Barry K"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-05T11:13:36+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"9","journal":"Irish Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1357402866,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23240283?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23240283","pubdate":"2012-12-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Management of the acute appendix mass: a survey of surgical practice.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-acute-appendix-mass-survey-surgical-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2923365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1435387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283514,"mean":5.9522896939469,"rank":178429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":92555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283514,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":1.6798461538462,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.3,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/287517178167689216","license":"public","citation_ids":[1155811],"posted_on":"2013-01-05T11:13:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"287517178167689216"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ascolcirugia\/statuses\/287594582655524864","license":"public","rt":["cirugiaF"],"citation_ids":[1155811],"posted_on":"2013-01-05T16:21:06+00:00","author":{"name":"ascolcirugia","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/l7mhDnbx","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2975559438\/bb5727644398fa485c141f19b8d811bb_normal.png","description":"Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Cirug\u00eda","id_on_source":"ascolcirugia","tweeter_id":"1011705806","geo":{"lt":4.65637,"ln":-74.11779,"country":"CO"},"followers":146},"tweet_id":"287594582655524864"}]}}
