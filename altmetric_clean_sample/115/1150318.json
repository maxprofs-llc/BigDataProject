Bimatoprost, at the dose used clinically for eyelash growth (0.03%) and given once daily for 14 days, increased pelage hair growth in C57\/black 6 mice. This occurred as a much earlier onset of new hair growth in shaved mice and the time taken to achieve complete hair regrowth, according to photographic documentation and visual assessment. Bimatoprost biodisposition in the skin was determined at three concentrations: 0.01%, 0.03% and 0.06%. Dose-dependent C(max) values were obtained (3.41, 6.74, 12.3 \u03bcg\/g tissue), and cutaneous bimatoprost was well maintained for 24 h following a single dose. Bimatoprost was recovered from the skin only as the intact molecule, with no detectable levels of metabolites. Thus, bimatoprost produces hypertrichosis as the intact molecule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002891","authors":["Woodward, David F.","Tang, Elaine S.\u2010H.","Attar, Mayssa","Wang, Jenny W."],"doi":"10.1111\/exd.12071","endpage":"148","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T10:14:53+00:00","issns":["1600-0625","0906-6705"],"issue":"2","journal":"Experimental Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1360765089,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/exd.12071\/abstract;jsessionid=4D2389527743ACBDD86B677A9043F582.d03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/exd.12071\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/exd.12071\/pdf","pmid":"23278986","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"145","subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"The biodisposition and hypertrichotic effects of bimatoprost in mouse skin","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biodisposition-hypertrichotic-effects-bimatoprost-mouse-skin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":1688719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":2794356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283432,"mean":5.9481623887295,"rank":89659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":191418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283432,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":2.3690015748031,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.9074285714286,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mylash\/statuses\/295539072552812544","license":"public","citation_ids":[1150318],"posted_on":"2013-01-27T14:29:40+00:00","author":{"name":"MyLash","url":"http:\/\/www.mylash.org","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1162163252\/ml_normal.png","description":"Mylash is a service so you can grow your own eyelashes longer, thicker and darker.
