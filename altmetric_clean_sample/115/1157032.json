A detailed analysis of root hydraulics provided evidence for a larger reduction in the osmotic component of Lp(r) (77%) in comparison with the hydrostatic component (34%) in response to the exposure of the root system to 13 degrees C. The activity of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.35) was reduced from 30 to 16 micro mol Pi mg(-1) protein h(-1) upon exposure to 8 degrees C for 1 day. Ultrastructural observations showed no evidence of loosening of the microstructure of endodermal cell walls in low temperature (LT)-treated roots. It is concluded that the rapid drop in the P(r) in response to LT is largely caused by a reduction in the activity of the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase rather than by loosening of the endodermal wall which would cause substantial solute losses. On the other hand, water permeability of root cell membrane at LT was related to changes in the activity (open\/closed state) of water channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000331e","authors":["Lee SH","Singh AP","Chung GC","Ahn SJ","Noh EK","Steudle E"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.0031-9317.2004.00248.x","endpage":"420","first_seen_on":"2013-01-06T14:59:15+00:00","issns":["1399-3054","0031-9317"],"issue":"3","journal":"Physiologia Plantarum","last_mentioned_on":1357483825,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.0031-9317.2004.00248.x\/abstract;jsessionid=77EE1E4A4B388EE8FA1161D2B1981E78.d03t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.0031-9317.2004.00248.x\/pdf","pmid":"15032838","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Munksgaard International Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"413","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Exposure of roots of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) to low temperature severely reduces root pressure, hydraulic conductivity and active transport of nutrients","type":"article","volume":"120","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exposure-roots-cucumber-cucumis-sativus-low-temperature-severely-reduces-root-pressure-hydraulic-con"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2015246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278756,"mean":5.7308059693997,"rank":149157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278756,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":1.4853333333333,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.6193846153846,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
