Success depends on the acceptance and use of contemporary molecular techniques, as well as the increasing development of farming systems that use saline water and integrate nutrient flows.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010Sci...327..833F","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["N.
