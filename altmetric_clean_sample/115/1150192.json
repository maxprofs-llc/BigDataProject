It compares the novel's presentation of biogerontological knowledge to current developments in the field, using Cambridge biogerontologist and immortality prophet Aubrey de Grey's book Ending Aging(2007) as an example. Based on the assumption that cultural criticism can and should impact scientific and medical research on aging, this paper asks whether (the analysis of) fictional texts can be seen as a cultural critical intervention into the ageism so often openly displayed in scientific discourses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c72","authors":["Ulla Kriebernegg"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaging.2012.10.003","endpage":"70","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T06:53:05+00:00","issns":["08904065"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Aging Studies","last_mentioned_on":1413577108,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jaging.2012.10.003","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0890406512000758"],"pmid":"23273558","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"61","title":"Ending aging in the Shteyngart of Eden: Biogerontological discourse in a Super Sad True Love Story ","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ending-aging-shteyngart-eden-biogerontological-discourse-super-sad-true-love-story"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.608,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.608},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":320743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4186405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283432,"mean":5.9520566063698,"rank":26515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":256910,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283432,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":4.0127068965517,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":4.78125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
