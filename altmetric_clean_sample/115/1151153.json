To address this gap, 7 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) implemented a periodic, objective infant-toddler hearing screening program during well-child visits. The study aimed to determine the ability of these primary care providers to implement the hearing screening protocol and to identify children in need of audiologic follow-up.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6013cf058f61000629a","doi":"10.1097\/dbp.0b013e318279899c","first_seen_on":"2013-01-02T20:22:04+00:00","issns":["0196-206X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1358627709,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/Abstract\/2013\/01000\/Early_Identification_of_Young_Children_with.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jrnldbp\/2013\/01000\/Early_Identification_of_Young_Children_with.3.pdf","pmid":"23275054","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"15","subjects":["behavioralsciences","pediatrics"],"title":"Early Identification of Young Children with Hearing Loss in Federally Qualified Health Centers","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-identification-young-children-hearing-loss-federally-qualified-health-centers-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.346,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.346},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":329863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4177432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283433,"mean":5.9538142482147,"rank":27292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":256141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283433,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":764,"mean":4.7859633027523,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":764,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":5.2934285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"DK":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Young children should have hearing tested more frequently: study","url":"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/health\/boostershots\/la-heb-young-children-hearing-screening-20130115,0,6114210.story?track=rss","citation_ids":[1151153],"posted_on":"2013-01-15T21:45:00+00:00","summary":"Parul Bhatia, a pediatrician at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles, remembers the patient well.\u00a0 The girl was 3 years old and profoundly deaf.
