Since the development processes behind the various surveys are not necessarily theoretical, but certainly practical and political, the extent of similarity among the dimensions covered in these surveys has been unclear. Another interesting question is whether prominent models from scientific research on work and health are present in the surveys - bearing in mind that the primary focus of these surveys is on monitoring status and trends, not on mapping scientific models. Moreover, it is relevant to know which other scales and concepts not stemming from these models have been included in the surveys. The purpose of this paper is to determine (1) the similarity of dimensions covered in the surveys included and (2) the congruence of dimensions of scientific research and of dimensions present in the monitoring systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Maren Formazin","Hermann Burr","Cecilie Aagestad","Tore Tynes","Sannie Vester Thorsen","Merja Perkio-Makela","Clara Isabel D\u00edaz Aramburu","Francisco Javier Pinilla Garc\u00eda","Luz Galiana Blanco","Greet Vermeylen","Agnes Parent-Thirion","Wendela Hooftman","Irene Houtman"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-14-1251","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T06:31:48+00:00","issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1492095765,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/14\/1251\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/14\/1251","https:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-14-1251"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2458-14-1251.pdf","pmid":"25488251","pubdate":"2014-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1251","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Dimensional comparability of psychosocial working conditions as covered in European monitoring questionnaires","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-14-1251","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dimensional-comparability-psychosocial-working-conditions-covered-european-monitoring-questionnaires"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":3187484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4855889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239863,"mean":7.6756166212239,"rank":73088,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239863,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6933,"mean":8.9429042123485,"rank":3484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6933,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":9.3495463917526,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
