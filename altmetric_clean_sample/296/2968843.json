Comparative genomic analysis revealed a single-base deletion in the cac3319 gene leading to C-terminal truncation in its encoding histidine kinase (HK) in JB200. To study the effects of cac3319 mutation on cell growth and fermentation, the cac3319 gene in ATCC 55025 was disrupted using the ClosTron group II intron-based gene inactivation system. Compared to ATCC 55025, the cac3319 HK knockout mutant, HKKO, produced 44.4\u00a0% more butanol (18.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3 vs. 12.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0g\/L) with a 90\u00a0% higher productivity (0.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 vs. 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u00a0g\/L\u00a0h) due to increased butanol tolerance, confirming, for the first time, that cac3319 plays an important role in regulating solvent production and tolerance in C. acetobutylicum. This work also provides a novel metabolic engineering strategy for generating high-butanol-tolerant and high-butanol-producing strains for industrial applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022dc","authors":["Mengmeng Xu","Jingbo Zhao","Le Yu","I-Ching Tang","Chuang Xue","Shang-Tian Yang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00253-014-6249-7","first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T00:58:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0614"],"journal":"Applied Microbiology & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1418533580,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00253-014-6249-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00253-014-6249-7.pdf","pmid":"25472438","pubdate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Engineering Clostridium acetobutylicum with a histidine kinase knockout for enhanced n-butanol tolerance and production","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/engineering-clostridium-acetobutylicum-histidine-kinase-knockout-enhanced-nbutanol-tolerance-product"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4617414,"mean":5.4160956271844,"rank":2042730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2553804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4617414,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150317,"mean":8.3397022273078,"rank":61364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":88005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150317,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1370,"mean":1.7684821037253,"rank":478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1370,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":1.5379393939394,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
