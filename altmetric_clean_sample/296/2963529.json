We studied expression of orexin-A and orexin receptors in the kidney and the presence of orexin-A-like immunoreactivity in human urine. Immunocytochemistry showed that orexin-A-like immunoreactivity and two types of orexin receptors (types 1 and 2) were localized in the tubules of the human kidney obtained at autopsy. Orexin-A-like immunoreactivity was detected in human kidneys (21.3 +\/- 6.2 fmol\/g wet weight, mean +\/- S.E.M., n = 4) and rat kidneys (16.2 +\/- 1.6 fmol\/g wet weight, n = 5) by radioimmunoassay, although the levels were much lower than the levels in the brain. Orexin-A-like immunoreactivity was present in the urine obtained from male healthy volunteers (67.8 +\/- 4.5 pmol\/l, n = 5). Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography showed that most of orexin-A-like immunoreactivity of the urine extract was eluted earlier than authentic orexin-A, suggesting that orexin-A-like immunoreactivity in urine was modified to hydrophilic forms. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed expression of orexin receptors 1 and 2 mRNAs in the human kidney. These findings suggest that orexin-A is produced by the renal tubular cells and secreted into urine. Orexin-A may act on the kidney in the autocrine or paracrine fashion, or via the urine (urocrine fashion).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["Takahashi K","Arihara Z","Suzuki T","Sone M","Kikuchi K","Sasano H","Murakami O","Totsune K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.peptides.2005.08.008","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T18:23:14+00:00","issns":["01969781"],"issue":"4","journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1418062951,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16202475"],"pmid":"16202475","pubdate":"2006-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Expression of orexin-A and orexin receptors in the kidney and the presence of orexin-A-like immunoreactivity in human urine.","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-orexina-orexin-receptors-kidney-presence-orexinalike-immunoreactivity-human-urine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751646,"mean":5.7094676731992,"rank":3977937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751646,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161713,"mean":8.2072306940737,"rank":128254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161713,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":584,"mean":2.4652212692967,"rank":490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":584,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.7192307692308,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
