We investigated whether exertion of cognitive control over speed-accuracy settings is not exclusively based on conscious representations, but can also be elicited by stimuli that are not consciously represented. Participants were instructed to point and click on a target, with a cue signaling before each response whether to prioritize accuracy of the response over speed, or vice versa. In half of the trials, the cue was masked to prevent a conscious representation of the cue. With visible cues, response patterns showed typical speed-accuracy tradeoffs, with faster and less accurate responses after speed cues, and slower but more accurate responses after accuracy cues. Crucially, this was found with masked cues as well. Our results are in line with recent findings on the relation of consciousness and cognitive control processes like task-set activation and response inhibition: masked cues are able to impact on cognitive control processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002589","doi":"10.1016\/j.cognition.2014.09.005","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T23:49:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00100277"],"journal":"Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1418691431,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0010027714001863"],"pmid":"25460379","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Adjustments of response speed and accuracy to unconscious cues ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adjustments-response-speed-accuracy-unconscious-cues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2235237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2745243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175662,"mean":8.0951070983316,"rank":69031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":103822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175662,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1237,"mean":10.882339805825,"rank":849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1237,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":15.9075,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
