In neuroblasts, Lgl relocalizes to\u00a0the cytoplasm at mitosis, an event attributed to phosphorylation by mitotically activated aPKC kinase and thought to\u00a0promote asymmetric cell division. Here we show that Lgl\u00a0also relocalizes to the cytoplasm at mitosis in epithelial cells, which divide symmetrically. The Aurora A and B kinases directly phosphorylate Lgl to promote its mitotic relocalization, whereas aPKC kinase activity is required only for polarization of Lgl. A form of Lgl that is a substrate for aPKC, but not Aurora kinases, can restore cell polarity in lgl mutants but reveals defects in mitotic spindle orientation in epithelia. We propose that removal of Lgl from the plasma membrane at mitosis allows Pins\/LGN to bind Dlg and thus orient the spindle in the plane of the epithelium. Our findings suggest a revised model for Lgl regulation and function in both symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["Graham P Bell","Georgina C Fletcher","Ruth Brain","Barry J Thompson","Graham\u00a0P.
