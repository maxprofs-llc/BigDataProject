This review article focuses on urea based dendritic polymers and summarizes their synthetic routes through both isocyanate and isocyanate-free processes. Furthermore, this article highlights applications where dendritic polyureas show their specific chemical and physical potential. For these purposes scientific publications as well as patent literature are investigated to generate a comprehensive overview on this topic.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008096","authors":["Tuerp, David","Bruchmann, Bernd"],"doi":"10.1002\/marc.201400510","endpage":"150","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T18:31:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3927","1022-1336"],"issue":"2","journal":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","last_mentioned_on":1423814453,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201400510\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/marc.201400510\/pdf","pmid":"25475145","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"138","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Dendritic Polyurea Polymers","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dendritic-polyurea-polymers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6699444,"mean":6.1606014046224,"rank":671951,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6018421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6699444,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229677,"mean":7.3596854960904,"rank":28185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":201004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229677,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1164,"mean":1.7090008598452,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1164,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.18,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
