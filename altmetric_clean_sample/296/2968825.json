They are commonly known as prion diseases. However, since all amyloids could be considered prions (from those involved in cell-to-cell transmission to those responsible for real neuronal invasion), it is necessary to find an underlying cause of the different capacity to infect that each of the proteins prone to form amyloids has. As proposed here, both the intrinsic cytotoxicity and the number of nuclei of aggregation per cell could be key factors in this transmission capacity of each amyloid.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100085cb","authors":["Raimon Sabate","Sabate R"],"doi":"10.4161\/19336896.2014.968464","endpage":"239","first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T00:51:20+00:00","issns":["1933-6896","1933-690X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Prion","last_mentioned_on":1418172646,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/19336896.2014.968464#.VIeYbcmnKSo"],"pmid":"25482597","pubdate":"2014-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"233","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"When amyloids become prions","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amyloids-become-prions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4605903,"mean":5.4169130224306,"rank":3734237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4605903,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149817,"mean":8.3787528835373,"rank":117540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149817,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":1.69864,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.021875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
