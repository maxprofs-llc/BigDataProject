However, little is known about the role of 5-HT(3) receptors in MAP-induced behavioral sensitization. Here, we measured the effects of MDL 72222, a 5-HT(3) antagonist, and SR 57227 A, a 5-HT(3) agonist, on the development and expression of MAP-induced behavioral sensitization, and alternations of 5-HT(3) receptor binding labeled with the 5-HT(3)-selective antagonist, [(3)H]GR65630, in mice. In addition, we investigated the effects of MAP on 5-HT(3A) receptor channel activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing 5-HT(3A) receptors. We found that MDL 72222 attenuated both the development and expression of behavioral sensitization to MAP (1.0 mg\/kg, i.p.), and that this attenuating effect of MDL 72222 was reversed by pre-treatment with SR 57227 A. In oocytes expressing 5-HT(3A) receptor, MAP exhibited a dual modulation of 5-HT(3A) receptor channel activity, i.e. pre-treatment with a low dose of MAP (0.1 microm) enhanced 5-HT-induced inward peak current (I(5-HT)) but a high dose of MAP (100 microm) inhibited I(5-HT). The acute administration of MDL 72222 with MAP decreased [(3)H]GR65630 binding versus MAP alone in the mouse striatum. Our results suggest that MDL 72222 attenuates MAP-induced behavioral sensitization via 5-HT(3) receptors in the caudate putamen, and that 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists like MDL 72222 have potential as novel anti-psychotic agents for the treatment of MAP dependence and psychosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Yoo JH","Cho JH","Yu HS","Lee KW","Lee BH","Jeong SM","Nah SY","Kim HC","Lee SY","Jang CG"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2006.04137.x","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T23:49:50+00:00","issns":["0022-3042"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1418168961,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16942594"],"pmid":"16942594","pubdate":"2006-09-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Involvement of 5-HT receptors in the development and expression of methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization: 5-HT receptor channel and binding study.","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involvement-5ht3-receptors-development-expression-methamphetamineinduced-behavioral-sensitization-5h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751646,"mean":5.7094676731992,"rank":1102477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":3627243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751646,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162093,"mean":8.2076709152829,"rank":43586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":117711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162093,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1930,"mean":2.9985412130638,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1930,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9473684210526,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
