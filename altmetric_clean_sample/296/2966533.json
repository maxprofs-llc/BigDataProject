In particular, they are important in ruminants where they digest a wide range of plant cell wall polysaccharides. For example, Ruminococcus albus 7 is a primary cellulose degrader that produces acetate usable by its bovine host. Moreover, it is one of the few organisms that ferments cellulose to form ethanol at mesophilic temperatures in vitro. The mechanism of cellulose degradation by R. albus 7 is not well-defined and is thought to involve pilin-like proteins, unique carbohydrate-binding domains, a glycocalyx, and cellulosomes. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics, fermentation analyses, and transcriptomics to further clarify the cellulolytic and fermentative potential of R. albus 7.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Christopherson MR","Dawson J","Stevenson D","Cunningham A","Bramhacharya S","Weimer PJ","Kendziorski C","Suen G"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-1066","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T13:10:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1439028483,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-1066.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25477200?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-15-1066.pdf","pmid":"25477200","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1066","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Unique aspects of fiber degradation by the ruminal ethanologen Ruminococcus albus 7 revealed by physiological and transcriptomic analysis.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unique-aspects-fiber-degradation-ruminal-ethanologen-ruminococcus-albus-7-revealed-physiological-tra"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5461682,"mean":6.3512561583122,"rank":2712266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2584597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5461682,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187796,"mean":8.0949908783515,"rank":85599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":94011,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187796,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4813,"mean":3.9059301745636,"rank":2809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4813,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":4.1960316455696,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
