CXCR2 is activated by binding of a number of ligands, including interleukin 8 (IL-8) and growth-related protein alpha (Gro-\u03b1). Monoclonal antibodies capable of blocking the ligand-receptor interaction are therefore of therapeutic interest; however, the development of biological active antibodies against highly structured GPCR proteins is challenging. Here we present a combination of techniques that improve the discovery of functional monoclonal antibodies against the native CXCR2 receptor. The IL-8 binding site of CXCR2 was identified by screening peptide libraries with the IL-8 ligand, and then reconstructed as soluble synthetic peptides. These peptides were used as antigens to probe an antibody fragment phage display library to obtain subpopulations binding to the IL-8 binding site of CXCR2. Further enrichment of the phage population was achieved by an additional selection round with CXCR2 overexpressing cells as a different antigen source. The scFvs from the CXCR2 specific phage clones were sequenced and converted into monoclonal antibodies. The obtained antibodies bound specifically to CXCR2 expressing cells and inhibited the IL-8 and Gro-\u03b1 induced \u00df-arrestin recruitment with IC50 values of 0.3 and 0.2\u00a0nM, respectively, and were significantly more potent than the murine monoclonal antibodies (18 and 19\u00a0nM, respectively) obtained by the classical hybridoma technique, elicited with the same peptide antigen. According to epitope mapping studies, the antibody efficacy is largely defined by N-terminal epitopes comprising the IL-8 and Gro-\u03b1 binding sites. The presented strategic combination of in vitro techniques, including the use of different antigen sources, is a powerful alternative for the development of functional monoclonal antibodies by the classical hybridoma technique, and might be applicable to other GPCR targets. Background: Development of functional monoclonal antibodies against intractable GPCR targets. Results: Identification of structured peptides mimicking the ligand binding site, their use in panning to enrich for a population of binders, and the subsequent challenge of this population with receptor overexpressing cells leads to functional monoclonal antibodies. Conclusion: The combination of techniques provides a successful strategic approach for the development of functional monoclonal antibodies against CXCR2 in a relatively small campaign. Significance: The presented combination of techniques might be applicable for other, notoriously difficult, GPCR targets.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008091","authors":["Ronald S Boshuizen","Catherine Marsden","Johan Turkstra","Christine J Rossant","Jerry Slootstra","Clive Copley","Klaus Schwamborn"],"doi":"10.4161\/mabs.36237","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T13:23:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1942-0870"],"journal":"mAbs","last_mentioned_on":1441250583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25484047?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25484047","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A combination of in vitro techniques for efficient discovery of functional monoclonal antibodies against human CXC chemokine receptor-2 (CXCR2).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combination-vitro-techniques-efficient-discovery-functional-monoclonal-antibodies-against-human-cxc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5988087,"mean":6.0397023726732,"rank":2571547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3282735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5988087,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191647,"mean":8.0565494818572,"rank":79378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":106236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191647,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":1.9216322418136,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":4.3143921568627,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
