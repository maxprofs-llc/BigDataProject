We present universal methods for the encoding of such libraries using the chemical ligation of oligonucleotides. These methods may be used to record the chemical history of individual library members during combinatorial synthesis processes. We demonstrate three different chemical ligation methods as examples of information recording processes (writing) for such libraries and two different cDNA-generation methods as examples of information retrieval processes (reading) from such libraries. The example writing methods include uncatalyzed and Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloadditions and a novel photochemical thymidine-psoralen cycloaddition. The first reading method \"relay primer-dependent bypass\" utilizes a relay primer that hybridizes across a chemical ligation junction embedded in a fixed-sequence and is extended at its 3'-terminus prior to ligation to adjacent oligonucleotides. The second reading method \"repeat-dependent bypass\" utilizes chemical ligation junctions that are flanked by repeated sequences. The upstream repeat is copied prior to a rearrangement event during which the 3'-terminus of the cDNA hybridizes to the downstream repeat and polymerization continues. In principle these reading methods may be used with any ligation chemistry and offer universal strategies for the encoding (writing) and interpretation (reading) of DNA-encoded chemical libraries.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b31","authors":["Alexander Litovchick","Matthew A Clark","Anthony D Keefe"],"doi":"10.4161\/adna.27896","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T16:15:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-0968"],"issue":"1","journal":"Artificial DNA","last_mentioned_on":1445012192,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25483841?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.4161\/adna.27896?hootPostID=c8df63db0b806e55617342c6a52bdd2d"],"pmcid":"PMC4014522","pmid":"25483841","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Universal strategies for the DNA-encoding of libraries of small molecules using the chemical ligation of oligonucleotide tags","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universal-strategies-dnaencoding-libraries-small-molecules-using-chemical-ligation-oligonucleotide-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":2752732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3339954,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190814,"mean":8.0106258168994,"rank":85493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":97154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190814,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":0.55357142857143,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
