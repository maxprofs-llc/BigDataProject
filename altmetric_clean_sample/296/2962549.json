Consumer's demand for naturally preserved food products is growing and the utilization of lactic acid bacteria is a promising way to achieve this goal. In this study, using a 2(5-1) factorial fractional design, we first evaluated the effects of fermentation time, of initial sucrose concentration and of the initial contamination amount of a spoilage yeast, on antifungal activities of single and mixed cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus K.C8.3.1I and Lactobacillus harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np in yogurt. L.\u00a0harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np, the most relevant strain with regard to antifungal activity was then studied to determine its minimal inhibitory inoculation rate, its antifungal stability during storage and its impact on yogurt organoleptic properties. We showed that L.\u00a0harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np maintained a stable antifungal activity over time, which was not affected by initial sucrose, nor by a reduction of the fermentation time. This inhibitory activity was an all-or-nothing phenomenon. Once L.\u00a0harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np reached a population of \u223c2.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(6)\u00a0cfu\/g of yogurt at the time of contamination, total inhibition of the yeast was achieved. We also showed that an inoculation rate of 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(6)\u00a0cfu\/ml in milk had no detrimental effect on yogurt organoleptic properties. In conclusion, L.\u00a0harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np is a promising antifungal bioprotective strain for yogurt preservation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f8","authors":["Emilie Delavenne","Sophie Cliquet","Cl\u00e9ment Trunet","Georges Barbier","J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mounier","Gwena\u00eblle Le Blay"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fm.2014.04.017","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T12:17:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9998"],"journal":"Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1418041023,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25481057?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25481057","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Characterization of the antifungal activity of Lactobacillus harbinensis K.V9.3.1Np and Lactobacillus rhamnosus K.C8.3.1I in yogurt.","type":"article","volume":"45PA","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-antifungal-activity-lactobacillus-harbinensis-kv931np-lactobacillus-rhamnosus-kc831"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4596437,"mean":5.3992147181961,"rank":3724791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4596437,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149261,"mean":8.3411623207826,"rank":117024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149261,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":2.9375894039735,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.0953333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
