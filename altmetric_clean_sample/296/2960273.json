Advances in high-throughput technologies and bioinformatics have allowed us to better understand complex biological processes at the genomic and proteomic levels. Components of the environmental milieu, along with the molecular mechanisms that drive the development, activation, and regulation of granulocytes, have since been elucidated. In this chapter, we present the intricate network in which these elements come together and influence one another. In particular, we describe the critical roles of transcription factors like PU.1, CCAAT\/enhancer-binding protein (C\/EBP\u03b1; alpha), C\/EBP\u03b5 (epsilon), and growth factor independent-1 (Gfi-1). We also review granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor-induced signal transduction pathways, their influence on proliferation and differentiation, and the cooperativity of cytokines and chemokines in this process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Hrishikesh M Mehta","Taly Glaubach","Seth Joel Corey","Mehta HM","Glaubach T","Corey SJ"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4939-2095-2_6","first_seen_on":"2014-12-07T11:58:29+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["0065-2598"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1428671768,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25480639?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25480639?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25480639","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hematology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Systems Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Systems Approach to Phagocyte Production and Activation: Neutrophils and Monocytes.","type":"article","volume":"844","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systems-approach-phagocyte-production-activation-neutrophils-monocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4980578,"mean":5.8934221874312,"rank":3522494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":816563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4980578,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172305,"mean":8.1181781850684,"rank":116488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":35612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172305,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1497,"mean":2.3001136363636,"rank":880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1497,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":1.440135021097,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
