Percutaneous thoracic duct embolization, transabdominal catheterization of the cisterna chyli or thoracic duct, and subsequent embolization of the thoracic duct is an alternative to surgical ligation of the thoracic duct. In this pictorial review, we present the detailed technique, clinical applications, and complications of lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc61","authors":["Edward Wolfgang Lee","Ji Hoon Shin","Heung Kyu Ko","Jihong Park","Soo Hwan Kim","Kyu-Bo Sung"],"doi":"10.3348\/kjr.2014.15.6.724","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T02:23:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1229-6929","2005-8330"],"issue":"6","journal":"Korean Journal of Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1490486531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4248627\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4248627\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4248627","pmid":"25469083","pubdate":"2014-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society of Radiology","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"724","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Lymphangiography to Treat Postoperative Lymphatic Leakage: A Technical Review","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.3348\/kjr.2014.15.6.724","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lymphangiography-treat-postoperative-lymphatic-leakage-technical-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":3510045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4863054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242625,"mean":7.7395160247956,"rank":80346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":160431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242625,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188,"mean":1.7054973262032,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.30625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
