Piezophilic (pressure-loving) organisms are adapted to deep-sea life and grow optimally at pressures higher than 0.1 MPa. To better understand high pressure adaptation from a genomic point of view three different Photobacterium profundum strains were compared. Using the sequenced piezophile P. profundum strain SS9 as a reference, microarray technology was used to identify the genomic regions missing in two other strains: a pressure adapted strain (named DSJ4) and a pressure-sensitive strain (named 3TCK). Finally, the transcriptome of SS9 grown under different pressure (28 MPa; 45 MPa) and temperature (4 degrees C; 16 degrees C) conditions was analyzed taking into consideration the differentially expressed genes belonging to the flexible gene pool.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Stefano Campanaro","Alessandro Vezzi","Nicola Vitulo","Federico M Lauro","Michela D'Angelo","Francesca Simonato","Alessandro Cestaro","Giorgio Malacrida","Giulio Bertoloni","Giorgio Valle","Douglas H Bartlett","Campanaro S","Vezzi A","Vitulo N","Lauro FM","D'Angelo M","Simonato F","Cestaro A","Malacrida G","Bertoloni G","Valle G","Bartlett DH"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-6-122","first_seen_on":"2014-12-10T00:31:41+00:00","issns":["1471-2164","","14712164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1428212818,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/6\/122","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/6\/122\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-6-122.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1239915","pmid":"16162277","pubdate":"2005-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Algorithms","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Combinatorial Libraries","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computational Biology\/Bioinformatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"122","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Laterally transferred elements and high pressure adaptation in Photobacterium profundum strains","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-6-122","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laterally-transferred-elements-high-pressure-adaptation-photobacterium-profundum-strains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4959518,"mean":5.8767582456149,"rank":3308872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1451502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4959518,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172436,"mean":8.0983822309858,"rank":109001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":55794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172436,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4558,"mean":3.8217577353522,"rank":3425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4558,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311,"mean":4.1651677419355,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Ph.
