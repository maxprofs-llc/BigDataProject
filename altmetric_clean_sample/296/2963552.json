Taking the perspective of a practicing clinician, I critically examine the historical origins of ideas that made shared decision making (SDM) a necessary and ideal model of clinician-patient relationship. I then build on MacIntyre's critique of Enlightenment thought and examine its implications for conceptions of shared decision-making that use an Enlightenment justification, as well as examining contemporary threats to SDM that the Enlightenment made possible. I conclude by offering an alternative framing of SDM that fits with the clinician's duty to act on behalf of and along with patients but that avoids the tenuous Enlightenment assumptions that MacIntyre's work so vocally critiques.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e49","authors":["Jon Tilburt","Tilburt, Jon"],"doi":"10.1093\/jmp\/jhr003","first_seen_on":"2014-12-08T18:31:35+00:00","issns":["1744-5019","0360-5310"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Medicine & Philosophy","last_mentioned_on":1505350599,"links":["http:\/\/jmp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/2\/148.full","http:\/\/jmp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/2\/148.short","http:\/\/m.jmp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/2\/148.short","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jmp\/article-abstract\/36\/2\/148\/903855\/Shared-Decision-Making-After-MacIntyre"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jmp\/article-pdf\/36\/2\/148\/2682668\/jhr003.pdf","pmid":"21378085","pubdate":"2011-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Arts and Humanities"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Shared Decision Making After MacIntyre","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/shared-decision-making-after-macintyre-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.05,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":1848392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6553668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242581,"mean":7.7378913677963,"rank":56531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":185773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242581,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":4.1287416413374,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":5.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
