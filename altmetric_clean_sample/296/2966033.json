We have earlier invented the Chromatin In Situ Proximity (ChrISP) technique to determine proximities between chromatin fibers within a single chromosome. Here we used ChrISP to identify chromosome 11-specific hubs that are enriched in the H3K9me2 mark and that project towards the nuclear membrane in finger-like structures. Conversely, chromosome 11-specfic chromatin hubs, visualized by the presence of either H3K9me1 or H3K9me3 marks, are chromosome-wide and largely absent at the nuclear periphery. As the nuclear periphery-specific chromatin hubs were lost in the induced reduction of H3K9me2 levels, they likely represent Large Organization Chromatin in Lysine Methylation (LOCK) domains, previously identified by ChIP-seq analysis. Strikingly, the downregulation of the H3K9me2\/3 marks also led to the chromosome-wide compaction of chromosome 11, suggesting a pleiotropic function of these features not recognized before. The ChrISP-mediated visualization of dynamic chromatin states in single cells thus provides an analysis of chromatin structures with a resolution far exceeding that of any other light microscopic technique.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c8","authors":["Xingqi Chen","Samer Yammine","Chengxi Shi","Mariliis Tark-Dame","Anita G\u00f6nd\u00f6r","Rolf Ohlsson"],"doi":"10.4161\/15592294.2014.971633","first_seen_on":"2014-12-09T11:29:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-2308"],"journal":"Epigenetics","last_mentioned_on":1425916895,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25482057?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25482057","pubdate":"2014-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"The visualization of large organized chromatin domains enriched in the H3K9me2 mark within a single chromosome in a single cell.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visualization-large-organized-chromatin-domains-enriched-h3k9me2-mark-within-single-chromosome-singl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4849854,"mean":5.7833928500501,"rank":2405694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2297987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4849854,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169460,"mean":8.0827557934372,"rank":77396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":84407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169460,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":4.2168126159555,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":8.5771379310345,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
