In contrast with H5N1 with over 650 confirmed cases over 11\u00a0years, H7N9 has infected over 450 persons within 2\u00a0years. The case fatality rate for H7N9 (35\u00a0%) is lower than for H5N1 (60\u00a0%) or H10N8 (67\u00a0%) but is comparable to that for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV), another emerging zoonosis with travel-associated importations. Exposure to poultry and fomites are considered the likely sources of infection for H7N9, H5N1, and H10N8, with limited human-to-human transmission in close contacts. Most cases have occurred in local populations of affected countries, and travel-related risk can be mitigated by avoiding exposure. Vaccines, antivirals, and other therapeutics remain in development stage or of modest benefit for dangerous infections carrying high morbidity and mortality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000705d","authors":["Rajeka Lazarus","Poh Lian Lim"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11908-014-0456-3","first_seen_on":"2014-12-07T09:26:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-3847","1534-3146"],"issue":"1","journal":"Current Infectious Disease Reports","last_mentioned_on":1423878895,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25475382?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11908-014-0456-3"],"pmid":"25475382","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Avian Influenza: Recent Epidemiology, Travel-Related Risk, and Management","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/avian-influenza-recent-epidemiology-travelrelated-risk-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4757505,"mean":5.7082384397391,"rank":2525791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1585062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4757505,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162324,"mean":8.2102415307753,"rank":82789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":59548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162324,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":2.1557983193277,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.85416666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
