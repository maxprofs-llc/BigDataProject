Favored models have risen and fallen, and healthy debates have swept back and forth. The field has recently reached a critical mass of compelling data that throws light on several previously unresolved issues. The time is ripe for a fruitful combination of these findings with two other long-running avenues of research, namely the biochemical properties of the PcG\/TrxG system and the application of theoretical mathematical models toward an understanding of the system's regulatory properties. I propose that integrating our current knowledge of noncoding RNA into a quantitative biochemical and theoretical framework for PcG and TrxG regulation has the potential to reconcile several apparently conflicting models and identifies fascinating questions for future research.
