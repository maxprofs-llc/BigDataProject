However, in many situations it is unclear whether these clusters result from person-to-person transmission or exposure to a common infectious source. We analyzed the possibility of person-to-person transmission in each cluster and developed a framework to assess the likelihood that person-to-person transmission had occurred. We described 21 clusters with 22 infected contact cases that were identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from March 2013 through June 2015. Based on detailed epidemiological information and the timing of the contact case patients' exposures to infected persons and to poultry during their potential incubation period, we graded the likelihood of person-to-person transmission as probable, possible, or unlikely. We found that person-to-person transmission probably occurred 12 times and possibly occurred 4 times; it was unlikely in 6 clusters. Probable nosocomial transmission is likely to have occurred in 2 clusters. Limited person-to-person transmission is likely to have occurred on multiple occasions since the H7N9 virus was first identified. However, these transmission events represented a small fraction of all identified cases of H7N9 human infection, and sustained person-to-person transmission was not documented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Liu, Bo","Havers, Fiona P","Zhou, Lei","Zhong, Haojie","Wang, Xianjun","Mao, Shenghua","Li, Hai","Ren, Ruiqi","Xiang, Nijuan","Shu, Yuelong","Zhou, Suizan","Liu, Fuqiang","Chen, Enfu","Zhang, Yanping","Widdowson, Marc-Alain","Li, Qun","Feng, Zijian","Bo Liu","Fiona P Havers","Lei Zhou","Haojie Zhong","Xianjun Wang","Shenghua Mao","Hai Li","Ruiqi Ren","Nijuan Xiang","Yuelong Shu","Suizan Zhou","Fuqiang Liu","Enfu Chen","Yanping Zhang","Marc-Alain Widdowson","Qun Li","Zijian Feng"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jix098","first_seen_on":"2017-09-22T10:48:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-1899","1537-6613"],"issue":"suppl_4","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1506419074,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article\/216\/suppl_4\/S548\/4162041\/Clusters-of-Human-Infections-With-Avian-Influenza#.WcTqOG6eknA.twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28934462\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28934462","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=Feng%20Z%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=28934462"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jid\/article-pdf\/216\/suppl_4\/S548\/19949361\/jix098.pdf","pmid":"28934462","pubdate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Clusters of Human Infections With Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus in China, March 2013 to June 2015","type":"article","volume":"216","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clusters-human-infections-avian-influenza-ah7n9-virus-china-march-2013-june-2015"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.992,"score_history":{"1y":9.992,"6m":9.992,"3m":9.992,"1m":9.992,"1w":1.25,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.992},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":908749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7553537,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122826,"mean":11.765792534093,"rank":18390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":104435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122826,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6974,"mean":6.665642047899,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6974,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":6.0093333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"CN":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ISARIC1\/statuses\/911180258904301568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26434415],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T10:47:57+00:00","author":{"name":"ISARIC","url":"http:\/\/www.isaric.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/895535081066033152\/HZQH0XCB_normal.jpg","description":"International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium - Collaboration platform for coordinating rapid research response to #outbreaks","id_on_source":"ISARIC1","tweeter_id":"625442237","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":782},"tweet_id":"911180258904301568"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/H7N9Influenza\/statuses\/911510279619584000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26434415],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T08:39:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Novel Influenza News","url":"http:\/\/h7n9flunews.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3501363698\/67e86cb1c0a5dbe79300ad64694b8c9d_normal.jpeg","description":"Dave is a published writer and former magazine editor.
