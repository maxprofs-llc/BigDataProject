Methods This was a prospective, observational study from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium from five US geographically defined regions from September 2003 through December 2005. Patients enrolled within 3 months of their lung cancer diagnosis were eligible. The eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was administered at diagnosis and 12 months' follow-up. The main outcome was survival, which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meyer curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results Among 1,790 participants, 681 (38%) had depression symptoms at baseline and an additional 105 (14%) developed new-onset depression symptoms during treatment. At baseline, depression symptoms were associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32; P = .01). Participants were classified into the following four groups based on longitudinal changes in depression symptoms from baseline to follow-up: never depression symptoms (n = 640), new-onset depression symptoms (n = 105), depression symptom remission (n = 156), and persistent depression symptoms (n = 254) and HRs were calculated. Using the never-depression symptoms group as a reference group, HRs were as follows: new-onset depression symptoms, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.01; P = .006); depression symptom remission, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.31; P = .89), and persistent depression symptoms, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.15 to 1.75; P = .001). At baseline, depression symptoms were associated with increased mortality among participants with early-stage disease (stages I and II; HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.04), but not late-stage disease (stages III and IV; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.22). At follow-up, depression symptoms were associated with increased mortality among participants with early-stage disease (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.31) and those with late-stage disease (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.69). Conclusion Among patients with lung cancer, longitudinal changes in depression symptoms are associated with differences in mortality, particularly among patients with early-stage disease. Symptom remission is associated with a similar mortality rate as never having had depression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["Sullivan, Donald R","Forsberg, Christopher W","Ganzini, Linda","Au, David H","Gould, Michael K","Provenzale, Dawn","Slatore, Christopher G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T18:59:31+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1527-7755"],"issue":"33","journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1501612323,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27996350"],"pmid":"27996350","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Longitudinal Changes in Depression Symptoms and Survival Among Patients With Lung Cancer: A National Cohort Assessment.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longitudinal-changes-depression-symptoms-survival-among-patients-lung-cancer-national-cohort-assessm-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307946,"mean":7.0029014072595,"rank":4422983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2313040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307946,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184652,"mean":11.880469826862,"rank":101187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184652,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8893,"mean":15.01829217274,"rank":6994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8893,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129,"mean":61.81853125,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Decision Sciences":1,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OHSUPulmCCM\/statuses\/892452884389822464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22531387],"posted_on":"2017-08-01T18:32:03+00:00","author":{"name":"OHSU PulmCritCare","url":"http:\/\/www.ohsu.edu\/pccm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/867948263286099969\/G7CN0i4v_normal.jpg","description":"Oregon Health and Science University - Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.
