The objective of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to investigate the influence of intraoperative remifentanil on acute and chronic postoperative pain after cardiac surgery.\nPatients (n=126) receiving standardized anesthesia with propofol and intermittent intravenous fentanyl at predetermined times for cardiac surgery, were randomized to receive intra-operatively either a continuous remifentanil infusion or additional intermittent intraoperative fentanyl as needed. Primary endpoint was chronic thoracic pain at 12 months after surgery, secondary endpoints were pain at three, and six months after surgery and analgesic requirements and pain levels in the first 72 hours.\nThere was no significant difference in incidence of chronic thoracic pain between the remifentanil and fentanyl group (20% vs. 18%, P=0.817). However, at three months, significantly more patients in the remifentanil group reported chronic thoracic pain (51% vs. 33%, P = 0.047). This effect was more pronounced in younger patients and patients receiving a higher dose of remifentanil (both P<0.05). The first 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, morphine consumption in the remifentanil group was significantly higher than in the fentanyl group (34.3 mg (interquartile range (IQR) 25.3-48.2) vs. 30.2 mg (IQR 19.2-38.1); P=0.028 and 46.8 mg (IQR 33.8-59.2) vs. 39.0 mg (IQR 6.2-51.4); P=0.047,respectively).\nIn conclusion, intraoperative use of remifentanil during cardiac surgery does not impacts chronic postoperative pain one year after surgery. Nevertheless, remifentanil increases analgesic requirements and thoracic pain until three months after surgery and its use is therefore less favorable during cardiac surgery.
