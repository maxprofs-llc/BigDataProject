Adjusting for sociodemographic determinants of position on the labor market, while employment rate was not different in 2011 compared with 2003, inactivity rate significantly decreased (adjusted prevalence rate ratio: 0.83, 95% confidence interval: [0.72-0.96]) and unemployment rate significantly increased (1.28 [1.04-1.57]). After additional adjustment for health status characteristics, the difference was no longer significant for inactivity (0.89 [0.77-1.03]) but remained significant for unemployment (1.55 [1.24-1.93]). Compared with 2003, in 2011 transitions to unemployment following HIV diagnosis tended to be more frequent (1.58 [0.92-2.68]) and access to work was significantly less frequent (0.57 [0.33-0.99]).\nImprovements in HIV care have not translated into improvements in PLWHIV's situation regarding employment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Annequin, Margot","Lert, France","Spire, Bruno","Dray-Spira, Rosemary",", "],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000000722","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T00:35:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5571"],"issue":"12","journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1441392384,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26244393"],"pmid":"26244393","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Has the employment status of people living with HIV changed since the early 2000s?","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/employment-status-people-living-hiv-changed-since-early-2000s-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6251511,"mean":5.8319631004321,"rank":2122225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4109927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6251511,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193348,"mean":9.255475647411,"rank":66027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":126231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193348,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2102,"mean":3.8429681104236,"rank":943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2102,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.7619032258065,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
