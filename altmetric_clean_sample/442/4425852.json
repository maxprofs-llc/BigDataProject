The main pharmacological effects of caffeine are mediated by antagonism of the adenosine receptor, A2AR. Here, weexamine whether the targeting of A2AR by caffeine plays a role in anti-tumor immunity. In particular,the effects of caffeine are studied in wild-type and A2ARknockout (A2AR(-\/-)) mice. Tumor induction was achieved usingthe carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MCA). Alternatively, tumor cells,comprised of 3-MCA-induced transformed cells or B16 melanoma cells, were inoculated into animalfootpads.Cytokine release was determined in a mixed lymphocyte tumor reaction (MLTR). According to our findings, caffeine-consumingmice (0.1% in water) developed tumorsat a lower rate compared to water-consuming mice (14% vs. 53%, respectively, p=0.0286, n=15\/group). Within the caffeine-consuming mice, tumor-free mice displayed signs of autoimmune alopecia and pronounced leukocyte recruitment intocarcinogen injection sites. Similarly, A2AR(-\/-) mice exhibited reduced rates of 3-MCA-induced tumors. In tumor inoculation studies, caffeine treatment resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and elevation inproinflammatorycytokine releaseover water-consuming mice, as depicted by MLTR. Addition of the adenosine receptor agonist, NECA, to MLTR resulted in a sharp decrease in IFN\u03b3levels;this was reversed bythehighly selectiveA2AR antagonist, ZM241385. Thus,immune response modulation through either caffeine or genetic deletion of A2AR leads to a Th1 immune profile and suppression of carcinogen-inducedtumorigenesis.Taken together, our data suggestthat the use of pharmacologic A2AR antagonistsmay hold therapeutic potential in diminishing the rate of cancer development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["Eini, Hadar","Frishman, Valeria","Yulzari, Robert","Kachko, Leonid","Lewis, Eli C","Chaimovitz, Cidio","Douvdevani, Amos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bcp.2015.08.092","first_seen_on":"2015-08-23T15:54:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00062952","1873-2968"],"journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1454720488,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006295215005377","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26296573"],"pmid":"26296573","pubdate":"2015-08-25T22:02:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Caffeine promotes anti-tumor immune response during tumor initiation; involvement of the adenosine A2A receptor.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caffeine-promotes-antitumor-immune-response-during-tumor-initiation-involvement-adenosine-a2a-recept"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7108255,"mean":6.3028542255213,"rank":3344154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3579684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7108255,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225290,"mean":8.6597304972724,"rank":106284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":109208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225290,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1654,"mean":4.9621282516636,"rank":1047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1654,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":2.7944444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
