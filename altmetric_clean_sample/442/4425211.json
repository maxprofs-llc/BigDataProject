A cross-sectional study of 100 HD patients was conducted. The Duke University Religion Index and the Ferrans and Powers QLI Dialysis Version-III were used. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson r correlation. Attendance to organizational religious activities and NORA were found to be correlated with some of the dimensions of HRQoL. Intrinsic religiosity showed a strong, positive correlation with HRQoL. It is essential to attend to and nourish their religious needs. Holistic approach in providing care to HD patients, with emphasis on spiritual care, is encouraged to improve their total health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f00","authors":["Jonas Preposi Cruz","Paolo C.
