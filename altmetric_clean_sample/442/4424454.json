It is unknown if this changes under long-access conditions (6 h sessions) under which the IVSA of cocaine and methamphetamine escalates. The entactogen class cathinone stimulants which exhibit MDMA-like monoamine effects in the nucleus accumbens, mephedrone (4-methylmethcathione) and methylone (3,4-methylenedioxymethcathinone), may support more reliable IVSA but results have been mixed. This study was designed to directly compare the IVSA of these three compounds. Groups of male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer mephedrone, methylone or MDMA (0.5 mg\/kg\/inf) under a Fixed-Ratio (FR) 1 schedule of reinforcement for 14 sessions. Following the acquisition interval, animals were evaluated in FR (0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 mg\/kg\/inf) and Progressive Ratio (PR; 0.125, 1.0 mg\/kg\/inf) dose-substitution procedures. Long access conditions escalated MDMA intake over the 6 h session but not in the first 2 h. In short access, drug intake was significantly higher in mephedrone-trained rats compared with either the methylone-trained or MDMA-trained groups during acquisition. Mephedrone resulted in the highest intakes during FR and PR dose-substitution in MDMA- and mephedrone-trained groups. Overall it was found that mephedrone is a more effective reinforcer than methylone or MDMA and represents a higher risk for compulsive use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","authors":["Vandewater, Sophia A","Creehan, Kevin M","Taffe, Michael A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2015.08.030","endpage":"545","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T17:15:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["00283908","1873-7064"],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1474402020,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0028390815300757","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26302654\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26302654","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1Rchu6T90TVoL"],"pmid":"26302654","pubdate":"2015-08-26T14:03:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"538","subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Intravenous self-administration of entactogen-class stimulants in\u00a0male rats ","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intravenous-selfadministration-entactogenclass-stimulants-male-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.008,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.008},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":863996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7545143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231820,"mean":8.943853333851,"rank":32413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":199405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231820,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2038,"mean":5.3951153657339,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2038,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":10.204149253731,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
