Closed claims analysis is a method of examining risk patterns and behaviors in lawsuits, including those involving health care practices. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate claims brought against midwives, with the intent of developing strategies to decrease the incidence of litigation.\nData were collected in joint meetings with members of the American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM); the American Association of Birth Centers; the American International Group (AIG), a major malpractice insurer for certified nurse-midwives\/certified midwives (CNMs\/CMs); and Contemporary Insurance Services, an independent insurance agency that has worked with AIG to facilitate the writing of malpractice insurance policies for CNMs\/CMs. The purpose of the meetings was to review 162 litigation cases that involved midwives insured by AIG and had been closed between the years 2002 and 2011. Follow-up analyses of data and reporting of results were performed by the authors, who are members of the Professional Liability Section of the ACNM Division of Standards and Practice.\nFindings reflected 7 major categories of liability risk ranging from the most prevalent (ie, fetal\/newborn complications or death) to the least prevalent (ie, attending a vaginal birth after cesarean). Data also were examined regarding the highest amounts incurred in court decisions or pretrial settlements because they were related to types of adverse outcomes that occurred.\nRecommendations for improving clinical practice and avoiding litigation based on findings from the closed claims analysis include, but are not limited to, the need for thorough and accurate documentation in practice, appropriate and timely consultation and collaboration, and the presence of practitioners whose clinical skills match the level of care assessed to be necessary for each woman for whom care is offered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d6d","authors":["McCool, William F.","Guidera, Mamie","Griffinger, Ellie","Sacan, Dulcy"],"doi":"10.1111\/jmwh.12310","endpage":"444","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T11:03:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1542-2011"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1440154983,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmwh.12310\/abstract;jsessionid=8E55AE3825F9D4E0F8F7B89299C5E3CF.f04t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmwh.12310\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jmwh.12310\/pdf","pmid":"26255804","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"437","subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Closed Claims Analysis of Medical Malpractice Lawsuits Involving Midwives: Lessons Learned Regarding Safe Practices and the Avoidance of Litigation","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/closed-claims-analysis-medical-malpractice-lawsuits-involving-midwives-lessons-learned-regarding-saf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6413110,"mean":5.9879681948331,"rank":3025142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1918117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6413110,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188811,"mean":9.3851349398867,"rank":101547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":68117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188811,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":4.4147228915663,"rank":260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.96,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
