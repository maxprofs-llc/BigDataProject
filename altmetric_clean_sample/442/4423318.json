Objective To examine the efficacy and safety of intralesional immunotherapy with tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) for treating recalcitrant wart. Methods In this randomized, placebo controlled, double blind clinical trial a total of 69 patients with recalcitrant warts received either intralesional PPD antigen (n=35) or intralesional saline (n=34) for six times at 2-week intervals. A third group of candidates for cryotherapy (n=33) was also included. The decrease in lesion size (good: complete response, intermediate: 50-99% improvement, poor: < 50% improvement), adverse effects, and recurrence within 6-month follow-up were documented. Results At the final session, good, intermediate and poor responses were observed in 77.1%, 22.9%, and 0% of the PPD patients; 0%, 14.7%, and 85.3% of the placebo patients; and 18.2%, 33.3%, and 48.5% of the cryotherapy patients, respectively (PPD vs. placebo: p<0.001; PPD vs. cryotherapy: p<0.001). No significant complication was seen in the PPD group. The recurrence rate was 8.6%, 5.9%, and 24.2% in the PPD, placebo and cryotherapy groups, respectively (p>0.05). Conclusion Intralesional immunotherapy with PPD antigen is highly effective and safe for treating recalcitrant warts.\nIRCT201407089844N3 in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fbc","authors":["Amirnia, Mehdi","Khodaeiani, Effat","Masoudnia, Sima","Fouladi, Daniel F","Mehdi Amirnia","Effat Khodaeiani","Daniel F.
