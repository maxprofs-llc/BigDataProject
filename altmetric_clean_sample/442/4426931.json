This review describes this metabolic pathway and pinpoints the enzymatic blockages in the various porphyrias. Recent advances in the understanding of the etiology of porphyria cutanea tarda are discussed, as are the abnormalities of porphyrin metabolism seen in chronic renal failure and in lead poisoning. An outline is given of the clinical and biochemical abnormalities seen in the porphyrias. Included is an algorithm to aid in the differential diagnosis of these diseases, and a brief review of the new analytical techniques available for the identification and quantification of porphyrins and their precursors in body fluids.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efc","authors":["J T Hindmarsh"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-24T04:05:22+00:00","issns":["0009-9147","1530-8561"],"issue":"7","journal":"Clinical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1440377992,"links":["http:\/\/www.clinchem.org\/content\/32\/7\/1255.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinchem.org\/content\/32\/7\/1255.full.pdf","pmid":"3521939","pubdate":"1986-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"The porphyrias: recent advances.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/porphyrias-recent-advances"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5521583,"mean":6.394768364573,"rank":4594038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5521583,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193516,"mean":9.3757579515802,"rank":155031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193516,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1558,"mean":4.2894849068722,"rank":1392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1558,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":7.9222222222222,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"www.clinchem.org","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1168045283210029&id=639107989470164","license":"public","citation_ids":[4426931,4426932,4426933],"posted_on":"2015-08-24T00:59:52+00:00","summary":"After all these years, dots have been connecting like crazy over these last few months.
