These patients are also predisposed to the development of vitamin D deficiency, which leads to an increased risk of immune dysfunction. Many extra-renal cells possess the capability to produce local active 1,25(OH)2D in an intracrine or paracrine fashion, even without kidney function. Vitamin D affects both the innate and adaptive immune systems. In innate immunity, vitamin D promotes production of cathelicidin and \u03b2-defensin 2 and enhances the capacity for autophagy via toll-like receptors activation as well as affects complement concentrations. In adaptive immunity, vitamin D suppresses the maturation of dendritic cells and weakens antigen presentation. Vitamin D also increases T helper (Th) 2 cytokine production and the efficiency of Treg lymphocytes but suppresses the secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. In addition, vitamin D can decrease autoimmune disease activity. Vitamin D has been shown to play an important role in maintaining normal immune function and crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Vitamin D deficiency may also contribute to deterioration of immune function and infectious disorders in CKD patients. However, it need more evidence to support the requirements for vitamin D supplementation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002542","authors":["Liu, Wen-Chih","Zheng, Cai-Mei","Lu, Chien-Lin","Lin, Yuh-Feng","Shyu, Jia-Fwu","Wu, Chia-Chao","Lu, Kuo-Cheng"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cca.2015.08.011","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T10:11:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3492","00098981"],"journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","last_mentioned_on":1461729053,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26291576?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0009898115003824","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0009898115003824?via%3Dihub"],"pmid":"26291576","pubdate":"2015-08-22T22:01:28+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"Vitamin D and immune function in chronic kidney disease ","type":"article","volume":"450","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-immune-function-chronic-kidney-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7615205,"mean":6.556701012339,"rank":1659619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5942261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7615205,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227488,"mean":8.6845680852093,"rank":58912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":167960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227488,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1128,"mean":2.8011286601597,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1128,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.6620689655172,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
