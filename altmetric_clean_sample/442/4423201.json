The Cat dyes with electron-donating or moderately electron-withdrawing substituents exhibit a broad absorption band corresponding to DTCT upon binding to TiO2 films, whereas those with strongly electron-withdrawing substituents exhibit weak DTCT. This study indicates that the introduction of a moderately electron-withdrawing substituent on the Cat moiety leads to not only an increase in the DTCT efficiency, but also the retardation of back electron transfer. This results in favorable conditions for the type\u2005II electron-injection pathway from the ground state of the Cat dye to the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode by the photoexcitation of DTCT bands.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Ooyama, Yousuke","Kanda, Masahiro","Uenaka, Koji","Ohshita, Joji"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201500419","endpage":"3057","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T09:37:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641"],"issue":"14","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1440251542,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cphc.201500419"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201500419\/pdf","pmid":"26296714","pubdate":"2015-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
