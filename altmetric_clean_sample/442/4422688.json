Time to diagnosis (TTD) was defined as time from initial symptoms to diagnosis at a Principal Treatment Centre. Patient pathways to diagnosis were mapped and routes for different cancers were compared.\nOnly 2\/93 cases (2.1%) in 10\u2005years were referred via the 2-week pathway. Most presentations were acute via immediate general practitioner (GP) referral or self-referral to the emergency department 62\/93 (67%). Leukaemia presented acutely and via the GP more often than via self-presentation to the emergency department 21\/28 (75% vs 25%), while solid tumours were self-referred to the emergency department 21\/34 (62% vs 38%) more often than via the GP. TTP and TTD were calculated for 87 patients. Wilms' tumour demonstrated the shortest median TTP of 7\u2005days and TTD of 16\u2005days. Lymphoma had the longest TTD, with TTP 107\u2005days and TTD 120\u2005days. Pathways to diagnosis via other specialties were longer.\nThe majority of children diagnosed with cancer present via acute services, with the route varying between tumour types. Only two cases in 10\u2005years were referred via the 2-week pathway, thus challenging its relevance in the paediatric population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002302","authors":["Jeremy Roskin","James Diviney","Vasanta Nanduri"],"doi":"10.1136\/archdischild-2015-308765","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T02:59:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14682044","1468-2044","0003-9888"],"issue":"12","journal":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","last_mentioned_on":1459010350,"links":["http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/21\/archdischild-2015-308765.short?rss=1&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26297700?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26297700?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/21\/archdischild-2015-308765.short?rss=1","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/archdischild-2015-308765"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/08\/21\/archdischild-2015-308765.full.pdf","pmid":"26297700","pubdate":"2015-08-25T09:55:07+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1131","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Presentation of childhood cancers to a paediatric shared care unit.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/time-diagnosis-childhood-cancers-presenting-paediatric-oncology-shared-care-unit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8184022,"mean":6.9215822464222,"rank":1313636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6866313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8184022,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230652,"mean":8.8966362946617,"rank":46012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":184452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230652,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3908,"mean":7.3579109291016,"rank":797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3908,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":9.2478529411765,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":6}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ADC_BMJ\/statuses\/634922614817841152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4422688],"posted_on":"2015-08-22T02:58:42+00:00","author":{"name":"ADC","url":"http:\/\/adc.bmj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784370270685523968\/_55Zxa8C_normal.jpg","description":"Archives of Disease in Childhood: for health professionals and researchers covering conception to adolescence.
