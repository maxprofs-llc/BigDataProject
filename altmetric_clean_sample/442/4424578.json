It is associated with rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases. Few cases of peripheral corneal melting have been reported in patients with psoriasis. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but metalloproteinases may play a pathogenic role. Anti-TNF therapy has shown to decrease skin and serum metalloproteinases levels in psoriasis. We report a 61-year-old man with peripheral corneal melting syndrome associated with psoriatic arthritis who received Adalimumab to control skin and ocular inflammation. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of peripheral corneal melting syndrome in psoriatic arthritis treated with Adalimumab showing resolution of skin lesions and complete healing of corneal perforation in three months.","authors":["Restrepo, Juan Pablo","Medina, Luis Fernando","Molina, Mar\u00eda Del Pilar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbr.2013.10.007","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T18:58:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1809-4570","04825004"],"issue":"4","journal":"Revista brasileira de reumatologia","last_mentioned_on":1439463241,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0482500414001697"],"pmid":"26253752","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"S\u00edndrome da ceratomal\u00e1cia (Corneal Melting) perif\u00e9rica na artrite psori\u00e1sica tratada com adalimumabe ","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/s%C3%ADndrome-da-ceratomal%C3%A1cia-corneal-melting-perif%C3%A9rica-na-artrite-psori%C3%A1sica-tratada-com-adalimumabe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
