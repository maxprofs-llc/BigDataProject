The only epidemiologic factor previously linked to collapsing FSGS is HIV infection. Here clinicopathologic findings are reported for a distinctive population of seven patients, who were older, Caucasian, and HIV negative and developed collapsing FSGS during active treatment of malignancy (multiple myeloma in six patients and metastatic breast carcinoma in one). Although oncologic treatment regimens included vincristine for four patients, doxorubicin for five patients, cisplatin for two patients, and total-body irradiation for one patient, the only agent common to all patients was pamidronate (Aredia). All patients had normal renal function before the administration of pamidronate. Patients began therapy with pamidronate at or below the recommended dose of 90 mg, intravenously, monthly, which was increased to 180 mg monthly in two patients and 360 mg monthly in three patients. Patients received pamidronate for 15 to 48 mo before presentation with renal insufficiency (mean serum creatinine, 3.6 mg\/dl) and full nephrotic syndrome (mean 24-h urinary protein excretion, 12.4 g\/d). Pamidronate, which is a member of the class of bisphosphonates, is widely used in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteolytic metastases. At the recommended dose of 90 mg, intravenously, monthly, renal toxicity is infrequent; however, higher doses have produced nephrotoxicity in animal models. The temporal association between pamidronate therapy and the development of renal insufficiency, the use of escalating doses that exceed recommended levels, and the distinctive pattern of glomerular and tubular injury strongly suggest a mechanism of drug-associated podocyte and tubular toxicity. These data provide the first association of collapsing FSGS with toxicity to a therapeutic agent.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["GLEN S. MARKOWITZ","GERALD B. APPEL","PAUL L.
