In contrast, a novel robotic finger was designed in this paper using SMA plates that were thermomechanically trained to take the shape of a flexed human finger when Joule heated. This flexor actuator was placed in parallel with an extensor actuator that was designed to straighten when Joule heated. Thus, alternately heating and cooling the flexor and extensor actuators caused the finger to flex and extend. Three different NiTi based SMA plates were evaluated for their ability to apply forces to a rigid and compliant object. The best of these three SMAs was able to apply a maximum fingertip force of 9.01N on average. A 3D CAD model of a human finger was used to create a solid model for the mold of the finger covering skin. Using a 3D printer, inner and outer molds were fabricated to house the actuators and a position sensor, which were assembled using a multi-stage casting process. Next, a nonlinear antagonistic controller was developed using an outer position control loop with two inner MOSFET current control loops. Sine and square wave tracking experiments demonstrated minimal errors within the operational bounds of the finger. The ability of the finger to recover from unexpected disturbances was also shown along with the frequency response up to 7 rad s(-1). The closed loop bandwidth of the system was 6.4 rad s(-1) when operated intermittently and 1.8 rad s(-1) when operated continuously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c5d","authors":["Engeberg, Erik D","Dilibal, Savas","Vatani, Morteza","Choi, Jae-Won","Lavery, John"],"doi":"10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T13:41:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-3190"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bioinspiration & Biomimetics","last_mentioned_on":1444732722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26292164","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002\/meta;jsessionid=625C41F756E058276BD59D9B4755EB4A.c1","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002\/meta;jsessionid=C77F3E71834BAC4053F08F8E7D655598.c1","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002\/meta","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002\/meta;jsessionid=2F0C2423A25C942405082943ACC9A199.c1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1088\/1748-3190\/10\/5\/056002"],"pmid":"26292164","pubdate":"2015-08-22T22:01:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Anthropomorphic finger antagonistically actuated by SMA plates.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthropomorphic-finger-antagonistically-actuated-sma-plates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":141.626,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":141.626},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6237522,"mean":5.9780720020044,"rank":32744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":6204806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6237522,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184333,"mean":9.4733577566566,"rank":1985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":182348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184333,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":18.257483516484,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":21.083333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
