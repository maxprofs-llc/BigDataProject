Here we present the unique structure of a cone-shaped amphiphilic designer peptide. When tracking its concentration-dependent morphologies, we observed elongated bilayered single tapes at the beginning of the assembly process, which further developed into novel double-helix-like superstructures at increased concentrations. This architecture is characterized by a tight intertwisting of two individual helices, resulting in a periodic pitch size over their total lengths of several hundred nanometers. Solution X-ray scattering data revealed a marked 2-layered internal organization. All these characteristics remained unaltered for the investigated period of almost three months. In their collective morphology the assemblies are integrated into a network with hydrogel characteristics. Such a peptide based structure holds promise for a building block of next-generation nanostructured biomaterials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008237","authors":["Kornmueller, Karin","Letofsky-Papst, Ilse","Gradauer, Kerstin","Mikl, Christian","Cacho-Nerin, Fernando","Leypold, Mario","Keller, Walter","Leitinger, Gerd","Amenitsch, Heinz","Prassl, Ruth"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12274-014-0683-9","endpage":"1833","first_seen_on":"2015-08-21T10:25:53+00:00","funders":["niehs","fwf"],"issns":["1998-0124","1998-0000"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nano Research","last_mentioned_on":1440152736,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26290684?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26290684","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atomic\/Molecular Structure and Spectra","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Materials Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"1822","title":"Tracking morphologies at the nanoscale: self-assembly of an amphiphilic designer peptide into a double helix superstructure.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracking-morphologies-nanoscale-selfassembly-amphiphilic-designer-peptide-double-helix-superstructur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5568281,"mean":6.3316453235122,"rank":4642316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5568281,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192580,"mean":9.2192809392509,"rank":154236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192580,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":6.8407209302326,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":7.3291428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
