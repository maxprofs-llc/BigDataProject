Lithium (Li) is a mood stabilizer that is considered the first-line treatment for this mood disorder. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of Li administration on behavior and cytokine levels [interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)] in the periphery and brains of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by amphetamine (d-AMPH).\nMale Wistar rats were treated with d-AMPH or saline (Sal) for 14\u00a0days; on Day 8 of treatment, the rats were administered Li or Sal for the final seven days. Cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1) levels were evaluated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus.\nThe present study showed that d-AMPH induced hyperactivity in rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and Li treatment reversed this behavioral alteration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, d-AMPH increased the levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 in the frontal cortex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), striatum (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and serum (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and treatment with Li reversed these cytokine alterations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nLi modulates peripheral and cerebral cytokine production in an animal model of mania induced by d-AMPH, suggesting that its action on the inflammatory system may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fd","authors":["Valvassori, Samira S","Tonin, Paula T","Varela, Roger B","Carvalho, Andr\u00e9 F","Mariot, Edemilson","Amboni, Rafaela T","Bianchini, Guilherme","Andersen, Monica L","Quevedo, Jo\u00e3o"],"doi":"10.1111\/bdi.12299","first_seen_on":"2015-08-23T19:53:31+00:00","issns":["1399-5618"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bipolar Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1457629024,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25929806","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/bdi.12299","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25929806?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25929806","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Lithium modulates the production of peripheral and cerebral cytokines in an animal model of mania induced by dextroamphetamine","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lithium-modulates-production-peripheral-cerebral-cytokines-animal-model-mania-induced-dextroamphetam"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377175,"mean":6.4096998099772,"rank":5321107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1798024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377175,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226059,"mean":8.7077549920817,"rank":141128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":70659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226059,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":573,"mean":4.8993181818182,"rank":416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":573,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":8.1988571428571,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
