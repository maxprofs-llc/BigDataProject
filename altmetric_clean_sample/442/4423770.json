The gene locus responsible for FMF was identified in 1992 and localized to the short arm of chromosome 16. In 1997, a specific FMF gene locus, MEFV, was discovered to encode for a protein, pyrin that mediates inflammation. To date, more than forty missense mutations are known to exist. The diversity of mutations identified has provided insight into the variability of clinical presentation and disease progression.\nWe report an individual heterozygous for the M680I gene mutation with a clinical diagnosis of FMF using the Tel-Hashomer criteria. Subsequently, the patient developed nephrotic syndrome with biopsy-confirmed fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN). Further diagnostic studies were unremarkable with clinical workup negative for amyloidosis or other secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome.\nIndividuals with FMF are at greater risk for developing nephrotic syndrome. The most serious etiology is amyloidosis (AA variant) with renal involvement, ultimately progressing to end-stage renal disease. Other known renal diseases in the FMF population include IgA nephropathy, IgM nephropathy, Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura as well as polyarteritis nodosa.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first association between FMF and the M680I mutation later complicated by nephrotic syndrome and fibrillary glomerulonephritis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cb","authors":["Patrick W Fisher","L Tammy Ho","Robert Goldschmidt","Ronald J Semerdjian","Gregory W Rutecki"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2369-4-6","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T11:00:01+00:00","issns":["1471-2369"],"journal":"BMC Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1440241186,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2369\/4\/6\/comments"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2369-4-6.pdf","pmcid":"PMC194618","pmid":"12908875","pubdate":"2003-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nephrology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Familial Mediterranean fever, Inflammation and Nephrotic Syndrome: Fibrillary Glomerulopathy and the M680I Missense Mutation","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familial-mediterranean-fever-inflammation-nephrotic-syndrome-fibrillary-glomerulopathy-m680i-missens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6550380,"mean":6.0700901193648,"rank":5588491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6550380,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197987,"mean":9.3609822512705,"rank":159703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197987,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":808,"mean":2.3720173482032,"rank":726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":808,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.9530909090909,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
