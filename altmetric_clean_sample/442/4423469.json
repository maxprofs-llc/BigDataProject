Latinas are less physically active than are women in the general population and little is known about Latina breast cancer survivors' levels of PA or their beliefs related to PA. We conducted a survey of 50 Puerto Rican (PR), 50 Mexican-American (MA) and 50 non-Hispanic white (NHW) breast cancer survivors to investigate similarities and differences in PA and social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs associated with PA.\nWe collected information on current PA using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ); comorbidities; anthropometric measures of body mass index [BMI (kg\/m(2))] and waist-to-hip (W:H) ratio; and SCT measures, including exercise self-efficacy, exercise barriers self-efficacy, modeling and social support from friends and family. Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance of differences between groups and regression models of the predictors of PA were performed.\nSurvivors from the three groups were similar in age (M\u00a0=\u00a056.8, SD\u00a0=\u00a011.0), BMI (M\u00a0=\u00a029.0, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.7) and co-morbidity (M\u00a0=\u00a02.09, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.69). Survivors differed in PA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), self-efficacy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), modeling (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and social support from family (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Social support from family member and exercise barriers self-efficacy were predictors of PA.\nConsistent with published studies, Hispanic breast cancer survivors self-report that they are less physically active than are non-Hispanic whites. SCT variables associated with PA differ among Hispanic subgroups and non-Hispanic whites. Further research is warranted in order to understand determinants of physical activity for specific ethnic breast cancer survivors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8113cf058f61000bb46","authors":["Hughes, Daniel C","Tirado-Gomez, Maribel","Vallejo, Liliana","Gonzalez, Velda","Trevi\u00f1o-Whitaker, Rose A","Villanueva, Gabriela","Basen-Engquist, Karen","Daniel C Hughes","Maribel Tirado-Gomez","Liliana Vallejo","Velda Gonzalez","Rose A Trevi\u00f1o-Whitaker","Gabriela Villanueva","Karen Basen-Engquist"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40064-015-1190-5","first_seen_on":"2015-08-22T10:14:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2193-1801"],"journal":"SpringerPlus","last_mentioned_on":1448280422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26295015?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26295015"],"pmid":"26295015","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Science, general","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Comparing determinants of physical activity in Puerto Rican, Mexican-American, and non-Hispanic white breast cancer survivors.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.springerplus.com\/content\/4\/1\/416","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparing-determinants-physical-activity-puerto-rican-mexicanamerican-nonhispanic-white-breast-cance-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419627,"mean":6.4515132245167,"rank":3075756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4236769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419627,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226363,"mean":8.6804029916683,"rank":83953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":137920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226363,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1689,"mean":3.1168838862559,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1689,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":3.5,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
