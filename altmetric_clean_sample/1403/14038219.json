Our patient presented an unusual course of the disease accompanied by a homogenous mild enlargement of her pituitary gland with an intact pituitary-endocrine axis which, to the best of our knowledge, represents a new finding in rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome.\nWe present a documented case of a 4 years and 8-month-old Syrian Arabic girl with a distinctive course of signs and symptoms of rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome accompanied by mature ganglioneuroma in her chest, a homogenous mild enlargement of her pituitary gland, generalized cortical brain atrophy, and seizures. Three months after her first marked symptoms were noted she had a sudden progression of severe respiratory distress that ended with her death.\nThe findings of this case could increase our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation, and place more emphases on pediatricians to consider rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome whenever early rapid onset of obesity, associated with any malfunction, is observed in children. This knowledge could be lifesaving for children with rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000858","authors":["Lama Aljabban","Lama Aljabban","Lina Kassab","Nour Alhuda Bakoura","Mohammad Fayez Alsalka","Ismaeil Maksoud"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13256-016-1116-z","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T10:05:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1752-1947"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1480420921,"links":["http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13256-016-1116-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13256-016-1116-z?site=jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"27876089","pubdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"328","title":"Rapid-onset obesity, hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, autonomic dysregulation and neuroendocrine tumor syndrome with a homogenous enlargement of the pituitary gland: a case report","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapidonset-obesity-hypoventilation-hypothalamic-dysfunction-autonomic-dysregulation-neuroendocrine-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":6775889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250610,"mean":12.178866345582,"rank":202948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250610,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1451,"mean":3.2157351724138,"rank":1051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1451,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":0.95044642857143,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":1,"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jmedcasereports\/statuses\/802090705309073408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14038219],"posted_on":"2016-11-25T10:05:00+00:00","author":{"name":"JMedCaseReports","url":"http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749973064763502592\/hd03yEgz_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Medical Case Reports: #openaccess journal publishing #casereports from all medical fields, edited by Prof @MichaelKidd5.
