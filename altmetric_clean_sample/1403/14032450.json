The crosstalk between the host and its microbiome occurs in part through the secretion of metabolites, which have a profound effect on host physiology. The immune system constantly scans the intestinal microenvironment for information regarding the metabolic state of the microbiota as well as the colonization status. Recent studies have uncovered a major role for microbial metabolites in the regulation of the immune system. In this review, we summarize the central findings of how microbiota-modulated metabolites control immune development and activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Maayan Levy","Eran Blacher","Eran Elinav"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2016.10.003","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2016-11-25T09:12:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13695274","1879-0364"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1480305360,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369527416301497","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369527416301497?utm_content=buffera5325&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"27883933","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"8","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Microbiome, metabolites and host immunity","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbiome-metabolites-host-immunity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.08,"score_history":{"1y":8.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8044026,"mean":6.8351932956417,"rank":1022407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7016578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8044026,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":261772,"mean":12.179606235985,"rank":48538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":212879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":261772,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":5.3153677884615,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":4.471875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
