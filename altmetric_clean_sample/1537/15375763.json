Data was collected by individual patient questionnaires except from Chile and Brazil where the data was obtained from a local centre questionnaire.\nThe prevalence rate averaged 131.1 per million population. The mean age of the 8972 incident patients was 50.5 years, with 58.2% males. The more frequent causes of renal failure were glomerulopathies (22.6%), vascular nephropathy (20.9%) and diabetes (16.9%). Haemodialysis was the most used treatment (88.3%). Gross mortality was 21.1% and the more frequent causes of death were cardiac complications and infections. The analysis of mortality risk factors using a logistic regression model showed that diabetics patients older than 65 years had the highest probability of death (43.0%) and patients with glomerulonephritis, younger than 65 years had the lowest (8.0%). The adjusted mortality rate was 241 deaths\/1000 patient-years at risk when the USRDS 1987-1989 white mortality rate by age groups and primary diseases was used as standard.\nIn spite of the economic difficulties, very important efforts have been made to treat ESRD patients and gross mortality statistics in some countries are similar to those reported by other regional registries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f61000317f","authors":["N Mazzuchi","E Schwedt","J M Fern\u00e1ndez","A M Cusumano","M S An\u00e7\u00e3o","H Poblete","M Salda\u00f1a-Ar\u00e9valo","N R Espinosa","C Centuri\u00f3n","H Castillo","F Gonz\u00e1lez","C L Milan\u00e9s","M Infante","M Ariza"],"doi":"10.1093\/ndt\/12.12.2521","endpage":"2527","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T01:46:10+00:00","issns":["0931-0509","1460-2385"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1072915200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ndt\/12.12.2521"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ndt.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/12\/12\/2521.full.pdf","pmid":"9430846","pubdate":"1997-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2521","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Latin American registry of dialysis and renal transplantation: 1993 annual dialysis data report","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/latin-american-registry-dialysis-renal-transplantation-1993-annual-dialysis-data-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6939019,"mean":6.2245338078075,"rank":1619677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4533417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6939019,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94222,"mean":10.899778584392,"rank":28251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94222,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2132,"mean":3.6726701079305,"rank":488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2132,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.24375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GT":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Diabetic nephropathy as a cause of end-stage renal disease in Egypt: a six-year study","url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/10665\/119458\/1\/10_4-5_2004_620_626.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[15356141,20606451,15375754,20606453,15375763,15375764,20606454,15375765,15375766,15375767,15375768,15375777],"posted_on":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"World Health Organization","description":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.","geo":{"country":"CH"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/119458","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-d56edec34c88075cf858030ec204ad078c457e9af24fa42004d998dd57d2f770.jpg"}}]}}
