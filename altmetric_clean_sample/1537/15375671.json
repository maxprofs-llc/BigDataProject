We have compared discontinuation rates between new intrauterine device (IUD) users (253 women) and new Norplant implant users (502 women) over 33 months following the introduction of Norplant implants among a population of women attending the same clinic and counseled in the same manner by the same group of providers. Women choosing the IUD were slightly older and were more likely to be changing their contraceptive method because of dissatisfaction with their current method. Nor plant implant users were more likely to have completed their families. Continuation rates for Norplant implants were significantly higher than for IUD at 12, 18, and 24 months after insertion. At 24 months, continuation rates for Norplant implants were 72% compared with rates of 55% for IUD users. Higher continuation rates may be related more to factors associated with the providers than with the users of these two long-acting methods.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000376a","authors":["Fleming, D","Davie, J","Glasier, A","Diana Fleming","J Davie","A Glasier"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0010-7824(97)00202-3","endpage":"21","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T01:37:55+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0010-7824","00107824"],"issue":"1","journal":"Contraception","last_mentioned_on":1072915200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0010-7824(97)00202-3"],"pmid":"9554246","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"19","subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Continuation Rates of Long-Acting Methods of Contraception","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0010782497002023","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/continuation-rates-longacting-methods-contraception-comparative-study-norplant-implants-intrauterine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6939019,"mean":6.2245338078075,"rank":1619662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4533401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6939019,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94207,"mean":10.900382183725,"rank":28248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94207,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1350,"mean":7.3370467012602,"rank":418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1350,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.0111111111111,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Contraception continuation rates and reasons for discontinuation in Zahedan, Islamic Republic of Iran","url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/bitstream\/10665\/119407\/1\/10_3_2004_260_267.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[15375592,15375593,20606467,15375615,20606469,13095450,15375671],"posted_on":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"World Health Organization","description":"The World Health Organization (WHO) is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.","geo":{"country":"CH"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/apps.who.int\/iris\/handle\/10665\/119407","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-cccfe983d0d5e7e2ba2b4cd943b6076d1b37a9dd62bdd590d3ca792052ed4169.jpg"}}]}}
