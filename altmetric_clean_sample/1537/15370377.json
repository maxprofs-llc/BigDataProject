We used scores from Conners Continuous Performance Test II to assess attention and based on a principal component analysis we evaluated scores on five different attention factors: focused attention, vigilance, hyperactivity\/impulsivity, sustained attention and response style.\nA higher frequency of the exposed offspring had a parent\/self-reported use of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication compared to the control group (2.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.01). Clinical significant differences between adolescents exposed to maternal diabetes and unexposed controls were not found in either single scores on Conners Continuous Performance Test or on any of the five attention factors identified.\nExposure to maternal type 1 diabetes did not seem to increase the risk of attention deficits in the adolescent offspring. However, a higher self-reported use of ADHD medication in the exposed group could suggest a difference in attention not revealed by the applied test.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Birgitte Bytoft","Sine Knorr","Zuzana Vlachova","Rikke B.
