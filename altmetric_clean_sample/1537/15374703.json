The aim of this prospective study was to assess the diagnostic usefulness of non-invasive testing for antibody to the leishmanial antigen K39 by means of antigen-impregnated nitrocellulose paper strips adapted for use under field conditions.\nOne drop of peripheral blood is applied to the hitrocellulose strip. Three drops of test buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus bovine serum albumin) are added to the dried blood. The development of two visible bands indicates presence of IgG anti-K39. 323 consecutive patients with suspected kala-azar referred to two specialist units in India, and 25 healthy controls, provided fingerstick blood samples for the test. Spleen aspirates were taken from 250 patients.\nKala-azar was confirmed by microscopy of spleen-aspirate smears in 127 patients. The K39 strip test was positive in all 127; the estimated sensitivity was therefore 100% (95% CI 98-100). Four patients had positive strip tests but negative aspirate smears; all four responded to treatment for leishmaniasis. 217 individuals, including the 25 healthy controls, 73 patients with malaria or tuberculosis, and 119 spleen-aspirate-negative patients who had presumed malaria or cirrhosis (79) or no final diagnosis (40), had negative strip-test results. None of the 119 aspirate-negative patients developed evidence of kala-azar during 3-6 months of follow-up. The estimated specificity of the strip test was 98% (95-100; 217\/221).\nDetection of anti-K39 by immunochromatographic strip testing is a rapid and non-invasive method of diagnosing kala-azar, which has good sensitivity and specificity and is well suited for use in field conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["Sundar, S","Reed, S G","Singh, V P","Kumar, P C","Murray, H W","Shyam Sundar","Steven G Reed","Vijay P Singh","Prasanna CK Kumar","Henry W Murray"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(97)04350-x","endpage":"565","first_seen_on":"2017-01-11T01:04:56+00:00","issns":["0140-6736","01406736"],"issue":"9102","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1199145600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0140-6736(97)04350-X"],"pmid":"9492776","pubdate":"1998-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"563","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Rapid accurate field diagnosis of Indian visceral leishmaniasis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S014067369704350X","volume":"351","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-accurate-field-diagnosis-indian-visceral-leishmaniasis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6938587,"mean":6.2245439834549,"rank":1619602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4533082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6938587,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94016,"mean":10.915624208903,"rank":28230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":64504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94016,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19593,"mean":26.083477950184,"rank":10466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19593,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":89.984717391304,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
