The older population is projected to almost double by 2050. Substantially more drinkers are likely.\nTo describe gender-specific trends (1997 to 2014) in prevalence of drinking status (lifetime abstention, former drinking, current drinking [including average volume], and binge drinking) among U.S. adults ages 60+ by age group and birth cohort.\nIn the 1997 to 2014 National Health Interview Surveys, 65,303 respondents ages 60+ (31,803 men, 33,500 women) were current drinkers; 6,570 men and 1,737 women were binge drinkers. Prevalence estimates and standard errors were computed by age group (60+, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80+) and birth cohort (<1925, 1925 to 1935, 1936 to 1945, 1946 to 1954). Trends were examined using joinpoint regression and described as average annual percent change (AAPC; overall change 1997 to 2014) and annual percent change (APC; in-between infection points). Primary analyses were unadjusted. All analyses (unadjusted and adjusted for demographics\/lifestyle) were weighted to produce nationally representative estimates. Statistical procedures accounted for the complex survey design.\nAmong men ages 60+, unadjusted prevalence of current drinking trended upward, on average, 0.7% per year (AAPC, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02); average volume and prevalence of binge drinking remained stable. Adjusted results were similar. Among women age 60+, unadjusted prevalence of current drinking trended upward, on average, 1.6% per year (AAPC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but average volume remained stable; prevalence of binge drinking increased, on average, 3.7% per year (AAPC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Adjusted results were similar. Trends varied by age group and birth cohort. Among men born 1946 to 1954, unadjusted prevalence of current drinking trended upward, on average, 2.4% per year (AAPC, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02); adjusted results were nonsignificant.\nOur finding of upward trends in drinking among adults ages 60+, particularly women, suggests the importance of public health planning to meet future needs for alcohol-related programs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021cc","authors":["Breslow, Rosalind A.","Castle, I\u2010Jen P.","Chen, Chiung M.","Graubard, Barry I.","Rosalind A.
