For practices, changes in admission rates for adults with ID between 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 were compared in 126 fully participating versus 68 non-participating practices. For individuals, changes in admission rates before and after the first health check for 7487 adults with ID were compared with 46\u2005408 age-sex-practice matched controls. Incident rate ratios (IRRs) comparing changes in admission rates are presented for: all emergency, preventable emergency (for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs)) and elective emergency.\nPractices with high health check participation showed no change in emergency admission rate among patients with ID over time compared with non-participating practices (IRR=0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19), but emergency admissions for ACSCs did fall (IRR=0.74, 0.58 to 0.95). Among individuals with ID, health checks had no effect on overall emergency admissions compared with controls (IRR=0.96, 0.87 to 1.07), although there was a relative reduction in emergency admissions for ACSCs (IRR=0.82, 0.69 to 0.99). Elective admissions showed no change with health checks in either analysis.\nAnnual health checks in primary care for adults with ID did not alter overall emergency admissions, but they appeared influential in reducing preventable emergency admissions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8083cf058f61000ba9f","authors":["Iain M Carey","Fay J Hosking","Tess Harris","Stephen DeWilde","Carole Beighton","Sunil M Shah","Derek G Cook","Carey, Iain M","Hosking, Fay J","Harris, Tess","DeWilde, Stephen","Beighton, Carole","Shah, Sunil M","Cook, Derek G"],"doi":"10.1136\/jech-2016-207557","endpage":"58","first_seen_on":"2016-06-17T22:34:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1470-2738","0143-005X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (1978)","last_mentioned_on":1481366239,"links":["http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/16\/jech-2016-207557.long","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/16\/jech-2016-207557.short?g=w_jech_ahead_tab","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/16\/jech-2016-207557.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27312249","http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/71\/1\/52.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jech.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2016\/06\/16\/jech-2016-207557.full.pdf","pmid":"27312249","pubdate":"2016-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"jech-2016-207557","subjects":["publichealth","healthservices","epidemiology"],"title":"Do health checks for adults with intellectual disability reduce emergency hospital admissions?
