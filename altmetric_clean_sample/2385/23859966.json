It is caused by mutations in the tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene, which encodes the tissue non-specific isozyme of ALP. HPP patients exhibit various presentations depending on their age at onset, such as infantile HPP combined with vitamin B6-responsive seizures.\nA newborn with infantile HPP presented with tonic convulsions from day 5 after birth and received intravenous vitamin B6 (10mg\/kg\/day pyridoxal phosphate). Eleven days later, frequent apneic episodes occurred, and head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral reticular formation lesions in the brain stem, including the medulla oblongata. After the pyridoxal phosphate dose was increased (to 40mg\/kg\/day), the patient's seizures and apnea resolved, and her MRI findings also improved. Genetic testing revealed that she was homozygous for the 1559delT mutation of TNSALP.\nHigh-dose pyridoxal phosphate is a useful treatment for HPP-induced seizures and might improve reticular formation lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002425","authors":["Fukazawa, Mitsuharu","Tezuka, Junichiro","Sasazuki, Momoko","Masumoto, Natsuko","Baba, Haruhisa","Doi, Takehiko","Tsutsumi, Yasushi","Mizuno, Yuji","Mihara, Futoshi","Nakayama, Hideki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.braindev.2017.07.015","first_seen_on":"2017-08-15T15:20:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0387-7604","1872-7131"],"journal":"Brain & Development","last_mentioned_on":1502810406,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28802630?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28802630","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","pediatrics"],"title":"Infantile hypophosphatasia combined with vitamin B6-responsive seizures and reticular formation lesions on magnetic resonance imaging: A case report","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infantile-hypophosphatasia-combined-vitamin-b6responsive-seizures-reticular-formation-lesions-magnet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181225,"mean":12.379232254006,"rank":148352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181225,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":642,"mean":2.2277722308892,"rank":492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":642,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.7729166666667,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/897478011498319873","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23859966],"posted_on":"2017-08-15T15:20:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2054},"tweet_id":"897478011498319873"}]}}
