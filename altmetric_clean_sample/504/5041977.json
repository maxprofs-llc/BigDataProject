After S-1+gemcitabine and S-1 chemotherapy, the liver metastasis had disappeared and we performed a pancreaticoduodenectomy( PD). Case 2: The patient was a 70-year-old woman who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis. After gemcitabine chemotherapy, the liver metastasis had disappeared and we performed a PD. The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is dismal compared to other types of cancer, and for a Stage \u2163b cancers, the 5-year survival rate is reported to be approximately 3%. We report 2 cases of liver metastases from pancreatic cancer that disappeared in response to chemotherapy. Both patients underwent primary tumor resection after chemotherapy and experienced long-term survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf4","authors":["Suda, Hiroshi","Omori, Keita","Suematsu, Yuki","Hiratsuka, Miyuki","Takahashi, Miyuki","Saito, Hiroyuki","Ishibashi, Yuji","Morita, Akihiko","Wakabayashi, Kazuhiko","Ito, Yutaka"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T11:15:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0385-0684"],"issue":"12","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho Cancer chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1459592412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26805373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26805373","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"[Two Cases of Liver Metastasis from Pancreatic Cancer with a Complete Response Owing to Chemotherapy].","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-cases-liver-metastasis-pancreatic-cancer-complete-response-owing-chemotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":5394663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1819006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323394,"mean":9.3786702804324,"rank":206087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":98329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323394,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":658,"mean":1.2667275494673,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":658,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.45333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/691940415851905028","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5041977],"posted_on":"2016-01-26T11:07:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"691940415851905028"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/716205061613850625","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5041977],"posted_on":"2016-04-02T10:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"716205061613850625"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/716208604739579904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5041977],"posted_on":"2016-04-02T10:20:12+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"716208604739579904"}]}}
