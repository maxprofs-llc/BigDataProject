However, the possible role of BG in the development of abnormalities observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) seems to be underestimated. One of the most consistent findings observed in ASD patients is loss of Purkinje cells (PCs). Such a defect may be caused by dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis, which is maintained mainly by BG. Moreover, these glial cells are involved in long-term depression (LTD), a form of plasticity which can additionally subserve neuroprotective functions. The aim of presented review is to summarize the current knowledge about interactions which occur between PC and BG, with special emphasis on those which are relevant to the survival and proper functioning of cerebellar neurons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ec5","authors":["Adrian Andrzej Chrobak","Zbigniew Soltys"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12035-016-9719-3","first_seen_on":"2016-01-27T06:04:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-1182"],"journal":"Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1453959306,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12035-016-9719-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26809583"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12035-016-9719-3.pdf","pmid":"26809583","pubdate":"2016-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neurology"],"title":"Bergmann Glia, Long-Term Depression, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bergmann-glia-longterm-depression-autism-spectrum-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7059888,"mean":6.2742286087554,"rank":2986377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4001770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7059888,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318719,"mean":9.2558042407392,"rank":130167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":183175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318719,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1220,"mean":4.4465676784249,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1220,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182,"mean":3.7950718232044,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
