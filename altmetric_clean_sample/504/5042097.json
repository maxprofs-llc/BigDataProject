We conducted a retrospective study of candidemia at Nantes Hospital, France, between 2004 and 2010. A total of 191 episodes (n = 188 patients) were reviewed. Incidence, demographics, risk factors, antifungal management, species identification, in vitro susceptibility and 12 weeks survival were analysed. Global incidence of candidemia was 0.37\u2030 admissions. Higher incidences were observed in haematology (6.65\u2030) and intensive care units (2\u2030). Central venous catheter and antibiotic exposure were the most frequent risk factors (77% and 76% respectively). Candida albicans was the predominant species (51.8%) followed by C. parapsilosis (14.5%), C. glabrata (9.8%), C. tropicalis (9.8%) and C. krusei (4.1%). However, species distribution differed significantly between medical units with frequency of C. tropicalis being higher in haematology compared to other medical units. Fluconazole and caspofungin were the main antifungals given as first-line therapy. Although not significant, 12 weeks mortality rate was 30.9%, being higher for C. tropicalis (44.4%) than for C. parapsilosis (16%). Acquired azole or echinocandin resistance was noted in some isolates, underlining the need for systematic antifungal susceptibility testing in patients with candidemia. These epidemiological findings will be of interest for antifungal stewardship at our hospital.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003140","authors":["Tadec, Laurent","Talarmin, Jean-Philippe","Gastinne, Thomas","Bretonni\u00e8re, C\u00e9dric","Miegeville, Michel","Le Pape, Patrice","Morio, Florent"],"doi":"10.1111\/myc.12470","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T11:21:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-0507"],"journal":"Mycoses","last_mentioned_on":1453807235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26806101?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26806101","pubdate":"2016-01-26T22:01:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Epidemiology, risk factor, species distribution, antifungal resistance and outcome of Candidemia at a single French hospital: a 7-year study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-risk-factor-species-distribution-antifungal-resistance-outcome-candidemia-single-french"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7047715,"mean":6.2650270246466,"rank":3505288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2031997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7047715,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318269,"mean":9.252672986288,"rank":165835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318269,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":419,"mean":1.7925693779904,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":419,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.0875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
