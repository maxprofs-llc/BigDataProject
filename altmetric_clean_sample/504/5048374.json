To date, there are no known effective strategies yet to combat WSSV infection. Hence, functional studies on genes critical for viral infection is essential in elucidating shrimp-virus interaction. Here we report the function of a gene from WSSV coding for a non-structural protein, VP9, utilizing RNA interference. Silencing of VP9 gene also effectively suppressed other gene region in the WSSV genome (wsv168 gene) as early as day 1 post infection (dpi). Three set-ups using Macrobrachium rosenbergii shrimp were prepared for treatment using VP9-dsRNA, GFP-dsRNA, and PBS. Each shrimp was challenge with WSSV, and survival rate was recorded. VP9- and GFP-dsRNA injected shrimps showed a significant survival rate of 80% and 70%, respectively, in contrast to 0% of the PBS injected shrimps at 25 dpi. Re-infection of shrimp survivors using a higher viral titer concentration, concurrent with the infection of new shrimp samples for the PBS control group, resulted in a significant 67% survival rate for VP9-dsRNA compared to 0% with that of GFP-dsRNA and PBS group. Challenge test on two more species, Penaeus monodon and Marsupenaeus japonicus, also significantly increased survival after VP9-dsRNA treatment. Our results provided evidence that VP9 gene plays an essential role in WSSV replication and it can be a potent target gene in the development of RNAi therapeutics for shrimps.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003708","authors":["Alenton, Rod Russel R","Kondo, Hidehiro","Hirono, Ikuo","Maningas, Mary Beth B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virusres.2016.01.013","first_seen_on":"2016-01-27T11:23:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7492"],"journal":"Virus Research","last_mentioned_on":1453893787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26811904?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26811904","pubdate":"2016-01-27T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Gene silencing of VP9 gene impairs WSSV infectivity on Macrobrachium rosenbergii.","type":"article","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-silencing-vp9-gene-impairs-wssv-infectivity-macrobrachium-rosenbergii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7054473,"mean":6.2693339663096,"rank":3511063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2033151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7054473,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318612,"mean":9.2534136046775,"rank":166055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318612,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":878,"mean":1.8707023945268,"rank":375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":878,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.1851851851852,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
