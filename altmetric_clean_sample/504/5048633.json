In the recent study, we screened a series of mercapto-tacrine derivatives with synergistic neuropharmacological profiles in vitro.\nWe investigated the effect and mechanism of ST09, a thioester derivative of tacrine containing a potential mercapto group, on the vascular dementia (VaD) model of rat induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (2-VO).\nST09 and its active metabolite ST10 retained excellent inhibition on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. ST09 significantly attenuated the 2-VO-induced impairment in spatial acquisition performance and inhibited the 2-VO-induced rise of AChE activity. In the VaD model, ST09 attenuated the oxidative stress and decreased the apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Compared with donepezil, ST09 exhibited a better effect on the regeneration of free thiols in 2-VO rats. Interestingly, ST09, not donepezil, greatly improved glucose metabolism in various brain regions of 2-VO rats using functional imaging of (18) F-labeled fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).\nST09 may serve as a more promising agent for the therapy of VaD than tacrine owing to the introduction of a potential mercapto group into the parent skeleton.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5213cf058f610003aa9","authors":["Liu, Jian\u2010Min","Wu, Peng\u2010Fei","Rao, Jing","Zhou, Jun","Shen, Zu\u2010Cheng","Luo, Han","Huang, Jian\u2010Geng","Liang, Xiao","Long, Li\u2010Hong","Xie, Qing\u2010Guo","Jiang, Feng\u2010Chao","Wang, Fang","Chen, Jian\u2010Guo"],"doi":"10.1111\/cns.12495","endpage":"229","first_seen_on":"2016-01-27T12:06:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1755-5949"],"issue":"3","journal":"CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1454109383,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/cns.12495","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26813743"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cns.12495\/pdf","pmid":"26813743","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"ST09, a Novel Thioester Derivative of Tacrine, Alleviates Cognitive Deficits and Enhances Glucose Metabolism in Vascular Dementia Rats.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/st09-novel-thioester-derivative-tacrine-alleviates-cognitive-deficits-enhances-glucose-metabolism-va"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7060796,"mean":6.2779102203052,"rank":727980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6322906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7060796,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318764,"mean":9.2615628727296,"rank":45232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":272525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318764,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":5.1046043478261,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":5.2739583333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
