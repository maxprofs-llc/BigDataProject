The bone loss in posterior region was higher than anterior region for maxilla. There was no significant difference in mandible. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that MBL was significantly higher when the crown\/implant (C\/I) ratio was 1.5\/2 (P < 0.05). Occlusal table width\/implant diameter (OT\/I) ratio was analyzed and it showed that MBL was significantly higher when the ratio was 2.5 to 2.99 and higher than 3. There were no significant associations between smoking and nonsmoking groups. Mann-Whitney U test revealed that cantilever does not affect MBL.\nThe marginal bone loss is affected by location of the implants (higher in the maxillary posterior region). In addition, excessive C\/I and OT\/I ratios increase marginal bone loss.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f45","authors":["Ozgur, Gozde Ozyanat","Kazancioglu, Hakki Oguz","Demirtas, Nihat","Deger, Sabire","Ak, Gulsum"],"doi":"10.1097\/id.0000000000000366","first_seen_on":"2016-01-27T07:52:01+00:00","issns":["1538-2982","1056-6163"],"issue":"1","journal":"Implant Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1463299993,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/Abstract\/2016\/02000\/Risk_Factors_Associated_With_Implant_Marginal_Bone.18.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/implantdent\/2016\/02000\/Risk_Factors_Associated_With_Implant_Marginal_Bone.18.pdf","pmid":"26655095","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"122","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Risk Factors Associated With Implant Marginal Bone Loss: A Retrospective 6-Year Follow-Up Study","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-associated-implant-marginal-bone-loss-retrospective-6year-followup-study-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":5547778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1877275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327318,"mean":9.3926659843512,"rank":208431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":99495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327318,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":909,"mean":0.88193832599119,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":909,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.892,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
