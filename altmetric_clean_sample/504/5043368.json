However, little is known regarding its pathogenesis.\nTo identify potential genetic predispositions to anti-TNF associated psoriasis in IBD patients.\nThis retrospective chart review included IBD patients enrolled in a prospective registry. Cases of anti-TNF associated psoriasis and idiopathic psoriasis unrelated to anti-TNF exposure were confirmed by an expert dermatologist. All patients were genotyped on the Illumina Immunochip. A weighted genetic risk score ascertaining genetic pre-disposition towards psoriasis was calculated and overall genetic pre-disposition as well as differential distribution of individual polymorphisms was compared across the three groups.\nOur study included 724 IBD patients who initiated anti-TNF therapy and did not develop psoriasis, 35 patients with anti-TNF associated psoriasis, and 38 patients with idiopathic psoriasis. Anti-TNF users who developed psoriasis had a modest but statistically significantly greater psoriasis genetic risk score than anti-TNF controls (mean 0.64 vs. 0.61, P = 0.04), and had a similar genetic risk score as those with idiopathic psoriasis (0.64 vs. 0.62, P = 0.22). Two loci associated with NOS2 and ETS1 genes achieved P < 0.05 when comparing anti-TNF associated psoriasis to anti-TNF controls. Three loci were significantly different between anti-TNF associated psoriasis and idiopathic psoriasis including a polymorphism near NOS2 encoding for inducible nitric oxide synthase that is produced by dendritic cells in skin lesions in psoriasis.\nPatients with anti-TNF associated psoriasis had a modestly greater genetic pre-disposition towards psoriasis but no single causative polymorphism was identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d1","authors":["Vedak, P","Kroshinsky, D","St John, J","Xavier, R J","Yajnik, V","Ananthakrishnan, A N","Vedak, P.","Kroshinsky, D.","St. John, J.","Xavier, R.
