Two of the cases were associated with other autoimmune diseases. Two newborns were born with signs of fetal distress, and one passed away hours later. Poor outcome was related to low compliance with treatment.\nAI is often overlooked during pregnancy because of its rarity and pregnancy-like symptoms. Nevertheless, other autoimmune diseases, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, nausea and vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension that does not improve with usual treatment or persists after first trimester should evoke a diagnosis of AI. If diagnosis and treatment are properly managed, pregnancy, labor, and delivery may occur without complications. If not, AI is associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Fux Otta, Carolina","Szafryk de Mereshian, Paula","Iraci, Gabriel Santino","Ojeda de Pruneda, Mar\u00eda Rosa"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2007.08.079","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T09:35:01+00:00","issns":["1556-5653","0015-0282"],"issue":"4","journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1453334400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2007.08.079"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015028207034814\/pdf","pmid":"18082735","pubdate":"2008-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Pregnancies associated with primary adrenal insufficiency","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pregnancies-associated-primary-adrenal-insufficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":3460435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2028280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317688,"mean":9.237975579737,"rank":165275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317688,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3546,"mean":6.3481732016925,"rank":2431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3546,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":6.1924625,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726086381","license":"public","citation_ids":[5041427],"posted_on":"2016-01-21T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
