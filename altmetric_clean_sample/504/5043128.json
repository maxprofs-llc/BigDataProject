Objective The climbing perception experienced by a pilot during takeoff at night is stronger than that experienced during the day. To investigate this illusion, this study assessed eye movements and analyzed their correlation with subjective climbing perception during daytime and nighttime takeoffs. Methods Eight male volunteers participated in this study. A simulated aircraft takeoff environment was created using a flight simulator and the maximum slow-phase velocities and vestibulo-ocular reflex gain of vertical eye movements were calculated during takeoff simulation. Results Four of the eight participants reported that their perception of climbing at night was stronger, while the other four reported that there was no difference between day and night. These perceptions were correlated with eye movements; participants with a small difference in the maximum slow-phase velocities of their downward eye movements between daytime and nighttime takeoffs indicated that their perception of climbing was the same under the two conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003806","authors":["Tamura, Atsushi","Wada, Yoshiro","Shimizu, Naoki","Inui, Takuo","Shiotani, Akihiro"],"doi":"10.3109\/00016489.2015.1132844","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T16:04:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-2251"],"journal":"Acta Oto-Laryngologica","last_mentioned_on":1453815787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26808614?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26808614","pubdate":"2016-01-26T22:00:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Correlation of climbing perception and eye movements during daytime and nighttime takeoffs using a flight simulator.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-climbing-perception-eye-movements-during-daytime-nighttime-takeoffs-using-flight-simulat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7047715,"mean":6.2650270246466,"rank":3505293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2031974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7047715,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":318269,"mean":9.2527047205497,"rank":165833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":318269,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":783,"mean":2.0197416879795,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":783,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.6455882352941,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
