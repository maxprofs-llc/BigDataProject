That means learning to observe internally and externally arising stimulations in a detached perspective. Both before and after attending a 8-weeks mindfulness training (MT) participants underwent an fMRI experiment (serving as their own internal control) and solved a own-body mental transformation task, which is used to investigate embodiment and perspective taking (and an non-bodily mental transformation task as control). We found a stimulus\u00d7time-points interaction: the own-body mental transformation task (vs. non-bodily) in the post (vs. pre-MT) significantly increased activations in the medial orbital gyrus. The signal change in the right medial orbital gyrus significantly correlated with changes in a self-maturity personality scale. A brief MT caused increased activation in areas involved in self related processing and person perspective changes, together with an increase in self-maturity, consistently with the aim of mindfulness meditation that is exercising change in self perspective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000378d","authors":["Barbara Tomasino","Fabio Campanella","Franco Fabbro","Tomasino, Barbara","Campanella, Fabio","Fabbro, Franco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.concog.2016.01.006","endpage":"158","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T18:02:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10538100","1090-2376"],"journal":"Consciousness & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1459943223,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S105381001630006X&_version=1&md5=234dfd006b5feda939fe9d37df8494a8","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S105381001630006X","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.concog.2016.01.006"],"pmid":"26821244","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"147","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Medial orbital gyrus modulation during spatial perspective changes: Pre- vs. post-8weeks mindfulness meditation ","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/medial-orbital-gyrus-modulation-during-spatial-perspective-changes-pre-vs-post8weeks-mindfulness-med"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8432351,"mean":7.0914708879412,"rank":3791751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4547333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8432351,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335212,"mean":9.5756433529921,"rank":134672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":195840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335212,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1043,"mean":13.487667946257,"rank":652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1043,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":9.96832,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
