The inorganic core of the molecules contains the cyclic fragments Ln(\u03bc-S2)Ln, LnSNSN and LnSN. Ten of the fourteen atoms of the core are coplanar, the remaining four S2 and I2 atoms lie in the other two orthogonal planes. The dysprosium complex upon excitation with UV light exhibits the metal-centered luminescence characteristic of the Dy(3+) ion. Geometric parameters of the molecules, computational data, electron spectroscopy and fluorescence suggest the existence of some conjugation in the mentioned heterocycles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Anatoly Fagin","Georgii K Fukin","Anton Cherkasov","Alexander F.
