The diagnostic efficiency increased when from one to five cells were biopsied (86.7%, 91.7%%, 96.0%, 96.8%, to 98.7%) and was maximized when more than six cells were biopsied. To compare the clinical efficiencies, blastocysts were divided into four groups according to biopsied TE\u00a0cell number: 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, and 16-41. For the blastocysts with grade A\u00a0TE score, no significant difference was observed in the survival and implantation rates among the four groups. For the blastocysts with grades B and C\u00a0TE scores, the survival rates showed no significant differences among the four groups, but a significant decreasing trend in implantation rates was observed with increasing biopsied TE\u00a0cell number.\nThe implantation potential is negatively affected by the biopsied TE\u00a0cell number in blastocysts with poor TE morphological score.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028c7","authors":["Shuoping Zhang","Keli Luo","Dehua Cheng","Yueqiu Tan","Changfu Lu","Hui He","Yifan Gu","Guangxiu Lu","Fei Gong","Ge Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fertnstert.2016.01.011","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T02:18:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0015-0282","1556-5653","00150282"],"journal":"Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1495683578,"links":["http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015-0282(16)00046-7\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26820770"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.fertstert.org\/article\/S0015028216000467\/pdf","pmid":"26820770","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"The number of biopsied trophectoderm cells is likely to affect\u00a0the implantation potential of\u00a0blastocysts with poor trophectoderm quality","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/number-biopsied-trophectoderm-cells-likely-affect-implantation-potential-blastocysts-poor-trophectod"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4395614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2301264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333298,"mean":9.5535650965952,"rank":175438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":121979,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333298,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4662,"mean":6.6007114353143,"rank":3459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4662,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":7.343775,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
