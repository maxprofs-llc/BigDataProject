In recent years, the Waddington diagram has been repurposed to illustrate how cellular identity changes in the context of reprogramming. In this Perspective, we revisit the Waddington diagram in light of the emerging recognition that plasticity is part and parcel of adult regeneration. Specifically, we speculate that the \"epigenetic landscapes\" that define identity in adult tissues are dynamic, facilitating cellular de-differentiation and trans-differentiation in the setting of injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f0","authors":["Rajagopal, Jayaraj","Stanger, Ben Z"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2015.12.021","endpage":"137","first_seen_on":"2016-01-26T17:59:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-5807","1878-1551","15345807"],"issue":"2","journal":"Developmental Cell","last_mentioned_on":1456146212,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/developmental-cell\/abstract\/S1534-5807%2815%2900830-8","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26812013?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/developmental-cell\/pdf\/S1534-5807(15)00830-8.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1534580715008308\/pdf","pmid":"26812013","pubdate":"2016-01-27T12:56:21+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"133","subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Plasticity in the Adult: How Should the Waddington Diagram Be Applied to Regenerating Tissues?","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasticity-adult-waddington-diagram-applied-regenerating-tissues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7229418,"mean":6.3648808956484,"rank":1453868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5767007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7229418,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320308,"mean":9.3217325191142,"rank":79863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":239815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320308,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2025,"mean":7.8861808300395,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2025,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":21.3845,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
