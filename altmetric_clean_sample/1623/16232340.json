Recently, there have also been numerous attempts to control crack formation in materials with the aim to prevent or isolate crack propagation. In this work, we utilize fragmentation, at submicron and nanometre scales, to create ordered metal oxide film coatings. We introduce a simple method to create modified films using electroplating on a prepatterned substrate. The modified films undergo preferential fragmentation at locations defined by the initial structures on the substrate, yielding ordered structures. In thicker films, some randomness in the characteristic sizes of the fragments is introduced due to competition between crack propagation and crack creation. The method presented allows patterning of metal oxide films over relatively large areas by controlling the fragmentation process. We demonstrate use of the method to fabricate high-performance electrochromic structures, yielding good coloration contrast and high coloration efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["L.
