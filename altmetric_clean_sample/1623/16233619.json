The efficacy of this strategy has been previously proven for mixed cultures of non-Saccharomyces and S. cerevisiae strains. In this work, we perform a transcriptomic analysis of the Crabtree-negative yeast Kluyveromyces lactis under tightly controlled growth conditions in order to better understand physiology of non-Saccharomyces yeasts during the fermentation of grape must under aerated conditions. Transcriptional changes in K. lactis are mainly driven by oxygen limitation, iron requirement, and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress appears as a consequence of the hypoxic conditions achieved by K. lactis once oxygen supply is no longer sufficient to sustain fully respiratory metabolism. This species copes with low oxygen and iron availability by repressing iron consuming pathways and activating iron transport mechanisms. Most of the physiological and transcriptomic features of K. lactis in aerobic wine fermentation are not shared with the Crabtree-positive yeast S. cerevisiae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Jordi Tronchoni","Alda J.
