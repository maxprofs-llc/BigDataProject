The existence of a large internal spacer sequence that separates the bipartite kinase catalytic core is a unique structural feature of SRPKs. Previous structural studies on a catalytically active fragment of SRPK1, which lacks the main part of the spacer domain, revealed that SRPK1 remains in an active state without any post-translational modifications or specific intra-protein interactions, while the spacer domain is depicted as a loop structure, outside the kinase core. Using systematic mutagenesis we now provide evidence that replacement of any individual cysteine residue in the spacer, apart from Cys414, or in its proximal flaking ends of the two kinase catalytic domains has an impact on kinase activity. Furthermore, the cysteine residues are critical for nuclear translocation of SRPK1 in response to genotoxic stress and SRPK1-dependent splicing of a reporter gene. While replacement of Cys207, Cys502 and Cys539 of the catalytic domains is predicted to distort the kinase active structure, our findings suggest that Cys356, Cys386, Cys427 and Cys455 of the spacer domain and Cys188 of the first catalytic domain are engaged in disulfide bridging. We propose that such a network of intramolecular disulfide bonds mediates the bending of the spacer region thus allowing the proximal positioning of the two catalytic subunits which is a prerequisite for SRPK1 activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Maria Koutroumani","Georgios E.
