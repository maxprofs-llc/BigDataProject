Fitbit accelerometers were used to measure steps of 6 elementary students during recess. The intervention included reinforcement, self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback. Steps taken during the intervention phase (M\u2009=\u20091,956 steps) were 47% higher than in baseline (M\u2009=\u20091,326 steps), and the percentage of recess spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was higher during intervention (M\u2009=\u200925%) than in baseline (M\u2009=\u20094%). These methods successfully increased steps during recess and could be used to increase steps in other settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["Hayes, Lynda B.","Van Camp, Carole M."],"doi":"10.1002\/jaba.222","first_seen_on":"2017-02-08T18:59:59+00:00","issns":["00218855","1938-3703"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1483228800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jaba.222"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jaba.222\/pdf","pmid":"26119136","pubdate":"2015-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Increasing physical activity of children during school recess","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/jaba.222","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-physical-activity-children-during-school-recess-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":1967952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4905300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251992,"mean":12.879215654527,"rank":87819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":160074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251992,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":873,"mean":7.1755366972476,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":873,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.6857142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
