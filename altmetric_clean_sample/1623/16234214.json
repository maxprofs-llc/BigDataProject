The oxidative insult and inflammatory mediators have some undefined role in CKD and cardiovascular complications. It is therefore, aimed at to pin point the predictive factors in the development of cardiovascular disorder in patients with chronic kidney disease.\nFifty patients of CKD experiencing cardiovascular distress and twenty normal individuals having same age and sex acted as control during these observations. Blood samples (Each 5 ml) were drawn and subjected to centrifugation for 10-15 minutes to separate the serum at 4000-5000rpm. The levels of MDA, GSH, SOD, CAT, VIT C, VIT E, IL-1, TNF-alpha, nitric oxide (NO) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) were estimated and analyzed.\nThe nitric oxide levels in the CKD patients decreased significantly (13.26\u00b11.25 ng\/ml) compared to controls (42.15\u00b15.26 ng\/ml). The serum vitamin E and C levels in these patients recorded 2.15\u00b10.25 \u03bcg\/ml and 0.97\u00b10.09 \u03bcg\/ml respectively as against their assigned controls which read 6.35\u00b11.22 \u03bcg\/ml and 3.29\u00b10.25 \u03bcg\/ml. Furthermore, a significantly higher level of Malondialdehyde (MDA) as1.25\u00b10.07 nmol\/ml was observed in CKD patients viz-a-viz relevant control. However, the serum SOD, catalase (CAT) and GSH levels in the same patients registered a significant decline as evident from respective figures 0.07\u00b10.002 \u03bcg\/dl, 1.22\u00b10.012 \u03bcmol\/mol, and 3.25\u00b11.05 \u03bcg\/dl. The control for these was observed as0.99\u00b10.06 \u03bcg\/dl, 3.19\u00b10.05 \u03bcmol\/mol, and 8.64\u00b10.03 \u03bcg\/dL. On the other hand, the IL-1 levels in the CKD patients found quite higher (402.5\u00b118.26 pg\/ml). This clearly points to substantial increase in oxidative insult and reduced NO levels leading to the renal and cardiovascular damage.\nObservations support the fact that the decrease in anti-oxidative capacity accompanied by higher inflammatory mediators in CKD is indicative of oxidative stress, consequently leading to CKD progression, in all probability to cardiovascular insult. The outcome reiterates that strategies be designed afresh to contain CKD progression to cardiovascular complications and ESRD. One way could be to focus on early detection of stress related to the disease. It requires analyzing the factors related to stress, such as the one reported here. Linking these factors with the symptoms could be a crucial step forward. And further, the disease could be monitored in a more disciplined manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mahmood Rasool","Muhammad Abdul Basit Ashraf","Arif Malik","Sulayman Waquar","Shahida Aziz Khan","Mahmood Husain Qazi","Waseem Ahmad","Muhammad Asif","Sami Ullah Khan","Ahmad Zaheer","Muther Mansoor Qaisrani","Abdul Rehman Khan","Aamir Iqbal","Amir Raza","Saima Iram","Kashif Kamran","Asim Iqbal","Mohammad Zahid Mustafa","Hani Choudhry","Mazin A.
