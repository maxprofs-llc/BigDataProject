It is conceivable, analogous with drugs, that the non-protein-bound fraction of p-cresol exerts toxicity. This aspect had never been evaluated, nor have the factors influencing the free fraction of p-cresol.\nIn a transsectional study we evaluated the relationship between prehemodialysis free p-cresol and the ratio of free to total p-cresol (F:T) to clinical and biological factors in 44 chronic renal failure patients. The evolution of free p-cresol was assessed prospectively in 12 patients showing a change in serum albumin of at least 5 g\/L over time. Hospitalization days attributable to infection and the free p-cresol concentrations were noted over a 1-year period. The impact of free p-cresol in vitro on leukocyte functional capacity was evaluated by chemiluminescence.\nWe observed a correlation between total and free p-cresol (r = 0.84; P <0.001). In the multivariate analyses, free p-cresol and F:T showed a negative correlation with albumin. A shift from normal serum albumin to hypoalbumininemia in 12 patients led to an increase in free p-cresol from 5.9 +\/- 3.2 to 8.2 +\/- 4.5 micro mol\/L (P <0.05; 0.64 +\/- 0.35 to 0.89 +\/- 0.49 mg\/L). Free p-cresol (P <0.05) was higher in the patients hospitalized for infectious disease. In vitro, free p-cresol was higher in a 25 g\/L than in a 50 g\/L albumin solution (P <0.05). Leukocyte chemiluminescence production was more inhibited in the low albumin (high free p-cresol) solution (28% +\/- 6% vs 21% +\/- 8%; P <0.05).\nHypoalbuminemia and total p-cresol increase the free fraction of p-cresol. Patients hospitalized for infections have higher free p-cresol. In vitro, high free p-cresol has a negative impact on leukocyte chemiluminescence production. These data demonstrate the toxicity of free p-cresol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efc","authors":["Rita De Smet","Jacqueline Van Kaer","Bruno Van Vlem","Antoine De Cubber","Philippe Brunet","Norbert Lameire","Raymond Vanholder"],"doi":"10.1373\/49.3.470","first_seen_on":"2017-02-08T20:06:01+00:00","issns":["0009-9147","1530-8561"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1220227200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1373\/49.3.470"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/clinchem.aaccjnls.org\/content\/clinchem\/49\/3\/470.full.pdf","pmid":"12600960","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Clinical Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistryclinical"],"title":"Toxicity of Free p-Cresol: A Prospective and Cross-Sectional Analysis","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.clinchem.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1373\/49.3.470","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxicity-free-pcresol-prospective-crosssectional-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7151164,"mean":6.3079823933502,"rank":1689234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4579657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7151164,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98710,"mean":11.119953844128,"rank":30646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":66449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98710,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1657,"mean":5.2295905797101,"rank":398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1657,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":119.84363636364,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
