Three peers were studied using a range of indicators, including academic engagement, coursework performance, and social validity assessments. Peers assisting a student with disabilities via curricular adaptation, assignment completion, and social facilitation constituted the multicomponent independent variable. We used withdrawal or multiple baseline designs to demonstrate positive benefits for peers for all measures used. In addition, follow-up data for 2 peers indicated that the positive changes associated with serving as a peer support were maintained for up to 2 months. Our results are discussed in relation to the possible academic and social effects of providing peer supports in general education classrooms for students with and without disabilities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["L S Cushing","C H Kennedy"],"doi":"10.1901\/jaba.1997.30-139","endpage":"151","first_seen_on":"2016-10-01T15:56:07+00:00","issns":["0021-8855"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1475337352,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284027\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1284027\/pdf\/9103989.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1284027","pmid":"9103989","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Academic effects of providing peer support in general education classrooms on students without disabilities.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/academic-effects-providing-peer-support-general-education-classrooms-students-without-disabilities"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":872181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7549205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253678,"mean":12.797290239162,"rank":40829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":211853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253678,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":895,"mean":7.2352125279641,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":895,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.245875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
