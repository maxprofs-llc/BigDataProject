Experimental and computational investigations indicate that transition metal catalysts are not required when basic additives are present. As in the case of using transition metals under basic conditions, the isomerization catalyzed solely by base also follows an sterospecific pathway. The reaction is initiated by a rate-limiting deprotonation. Formation of an intimate ion pair between an allylic anion and the conjugate acid of the base results in efficient transfer of chirality. Through this mechanism, stereochemical information contained in the allylic alcohols is transferred to the ketone products. The sterospecific isomerization is also applicable for the first time to allylic ethers, yielding synthetically valuable enantioenriched (up to 97% ee) enol ethers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Samuel Martinez-Erro","Martinez-Erro, Samuel","Sanz-Marco, Amparo","Bermejo G\u00f3mez, Antonio","V\u00e1zquez-Romero, Ana","Ahlquist, M\u00e5rten S G","Martin-Matute, Belen","Amparo Sanz-Marco","Antonio Bermejo G\u00f3mez","Ana V\u00e1zquez-Romero","M\u00e5rten S.
