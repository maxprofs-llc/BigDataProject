Participants in the LRS and RT-LRS groups consumed 500 mg of LRS daily for 8 weeks. RT was conducted 3 times\/week for 8 weeks for participants in the RT and RT-LRS groups. The following parameters were measured before and after the intervention period: Anthropometric data, isokinetic muscular strength and power, and anaerobic and aerobic fitness. Blood samples were also collected to determine immune parameters.\nIsokinetic muscular strength and power were increased (P < 0.05) in participants of both RT and RT-LRS groups. RT-LRS group had shown increases (P < 0.05) in shoulder extension peak torque, shoulder flexion and extension average power, knee flexion peak torque, and knee flexion and extension average power. There were also increases (P < 0.05) in anaerobic power and capacity and aerobic fitness in this group. Similarly, RT group had increases (P < 0.05) in shoulder flexion average power, knee flexion and extension peak torque, and knee flexion and extension average power. In addition, increases (P < 0.05) in anaerobic power and capacity, aerobic fitness, T lymphocytes (CD3 and CD4), and B lymphocytes (CD19) counts were observed in the RT group.\nRT elicited increased isokinetic muscular strength and power, anaerobic and aerobic fitness, and immune parameters among young males. However, supplementation with LRS during RT did not provide additive benefits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e98","authors":["Chen","Chee Keong Chen","Nor Faeiza Hamdan","Foong Kiew Ooi","Wan Zuraida Wan Abd Hamid"],"doi":"10.4103\/2008-7802.190604","first_seen_on":"2016-10-01T09:56:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-7802"],"journal":"International Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1475315780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijpvmjournal.net\/article.asp?issn=2008-7802%3Byear%3D2016%3Bvolume%3D7%3Bissue%3D1%3Bspage%3D107%3Bepage%3D107%3Baulast%3DChen#.V--H_hr-4hY.twitter","http:\/\/www.ijpvmjournal.net\/article.asp?issn=2008-7802;year=2016;volume=7;issue=1;spage=107;epage=107;aulast=Chen#.V--IN6_t2SY.linkedin"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijpvmjournal.net\/article.asp?issn=2008-7802;year=2016;volume=7;issue=1;spage=107;epage=107;aulast=Chen;type=2","pmcid":"PMC5036278","pmid":"27833721","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","title":"Combined effects of lignosus rhinocerotis supplementation and resistance training on isokinetic muscular strength and power, anaerobic and aerobic fitness level, and immune parameters in young males","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-effects-lignosus-rhinocerotis-supplementation-resistance-training-isokinetic-muscular-stren"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":7307299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253676,"mean":12.797454207154,"rank":207677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253676,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292,"mean":6.4137731958763,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/782157124805820416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12360680],"posted_on":"2016-10-01T09:56:04+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
