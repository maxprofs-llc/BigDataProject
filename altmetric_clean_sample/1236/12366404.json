The activity of RyRs is regulated by both, cytosolic and SR luminal Ca(2+). Deregulation of the CICR, by dysfunctional SR Ca(2+) release or uptake, is frequently associated with cardiac pathologies (e.g. arrhythmias, CPVT, heart failure). Recently, the interest to directly measure changes of the free Ca(2+) concentration within the SR ([Ca(2+)]SR) has led to the application of low affinity Ca(2+) indicators (mag-fluo-4, Fluo-5N) to follow changes of [Ca(2+)]SR in cardiomyocytes from some species. However, direct measurement of Ca(2+) signals from the SR have not been possible in freshly isolated mouse cardiomyocytes. Here, we show a new protocol optimized to measure changes of [Ca(2+)]SR in mouse cardiomyocytes using fluorescent Ca(2+) indicators and confocal microscopy. The application of this protocol permits the design of experimental studies with direct evaluation of SR Ca(2+) in real time in various mouse models of cardiac disease, including transgenic animals harboring mutants of RyRs or other Ca(2+) signaling proteins. The technique, in combination with these models, will help to understand how these diseases and mutations affect Ca(2+) signals within the SR and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of the RyRs for cytosolic and SR luminal Ca(2+), thereby contributing to arrhythmias or weak heart beat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e16","authors":["Fernandez-Tenorio, Miguel","Niggli, Ernst"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ceca.2016.07.002","first_seen_on":"2016-10-01T18:19:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-1991","01434160"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cell Calcium","last_mentioned_on":1476174246,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0143416016301099"],"pmid":"27431464","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Real-time intra-store confocal Ca2+ imaging in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-intrastore-confocal-ca2-imaging-isolated-mouse-cardiomyocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":3857291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3639911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240731,"mean":12.534739417605,"rank":130855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240731,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":2.0142965517241,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.525,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
