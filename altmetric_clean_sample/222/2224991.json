Biomarkers that quantify the extent of early brain injury are needed to improve the prognostic accuracy and aid patient management. Our objective was to assess whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein biomarkers of neuroaxonal and glial cell injury are elevated in distinct forms of acute encephalitis and predictive of poor outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002840","authors":["Sellner, J.","Davies, N.
