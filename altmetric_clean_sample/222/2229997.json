This strain was engineered to produce GABA more efficiently from biomass-derived sugars. To enhance GABA production further by increasing the intracellular concentration of its precursor glutamate, we focused on engineering pknG (encoding serine\/threonine protein kinase G), which controls the activity of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (Odh) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle branch point leading to glutamate synthesis. We succeeded in expressing GadB in a C. glutamicum strain harboring a deletion of pknG. C. glutamicum strains GAD and GAD \u2206pknG were cultured in GP2 medium containing 100\u00a0g\u00a0L(-1) glucose and 0.1\u00a0mM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Strain GAD\u2206pknG produced 31.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.41\u00a0g\u00a0L(-1) (0.259\u00a0g\u00a0L(-1)\u00a0h(-1)) of GABA in 120\u00a0hours, representing a 2.29-fold higher level compared with GAD. The production yield of GABA from glucose by GAD\u2206pknG reached 0.893\u00a0mol\u00a0mol(-1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ac","doi":"10.1186\/s13568-014-0020-4","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T02:19:44+00:00","issns":["2191-0855"],"issue":"1","journal":"AMB Express","last_mentioned_on":1396405163,"links":["http:\/\/www.amb-express.com\/content\/4\/1\/20"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amb-express.com\/content\/pdf\/s13568-014-0020-4.pdf","pmid":"24949255","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"20","title":"Disruption of pknG enhances production of gamma-aminobutyric acid by Corynebacterium glutamicum expressing glutamate decarboxylase","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disruption-pkng-enhances-production-gammaaminobutyric-acid-corynebacterium-glutamicum-expressing-glu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2285862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1639518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106686,"mean":7.9671447719926,"rank":52391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":39694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106686,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":1.2890404040404,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.903125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
