On radiographic examination, two teeth, present at birth, were found to be early erupted deciduous lower central incisors. A family history of natal teeth, all involving both lower deciduous central incisors associated with trauma to the tongue during suckling, was elicited. The ulceration healed over a period of four weeks using an innovative conservative treatment regime, involving the use of Stomahesive Wafer. Four months later the only sign of any previous pathosis was a fibrous scar on the ventral surface of the tongue.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f1f","authors":["S Buchanan","C R Jenkins"],"first_seen_on":"2014-03-30T02:11:12+00:00","issns":["0045-0421"],"issue":"4","journal":"Australian Dental Journal","last_mentioned_on":1396008000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9316308"],"pmid":"9316308","pubdate":"1997-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Riga-Fedes syndrome: natal or neonatal teeth associated with tongue ulceration.
