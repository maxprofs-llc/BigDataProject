By combining computational modelling with experimentation, we identify that Notch\/VEGFR-regulated differential dynamics of VE-cadherin junctions drive functional endothelial cell rearrangements during sprouting. We propose that continual flux in Notch signalling levels in individual cells results in differential VE-cadherin turnover and junctional-cortex protrusions, which powers differential cell movement. In cultured endothelial cells, Notch signalling quantitatively reduced junctional VE-cadherin mobility. In simulations, only differential adhesion dynamics generated long-range position changes, required for tip cell competition and stalk cell intercalation. Simulation and quantitative image analysis on VE-cadherin junctional patterning in vivo identified that differential VE-cadherin mobility is lost under pathological high VEGF conditions, in retinopathy and tumour vessels. Our results provide a mechanistic concept for how cells rearrange during normal sprouting and how rearrangement switches to generate abnormal vessels in pathologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003163","doi":"10.1038\/ncb2926","first_seen_on":"2014-04-02T00:37:37+00:00","funders":["cruk"],"issns":["1465-7392","1476-4679"],"journal":"Nature Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1403176020,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncb2926","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncb\/journal\/v16\/n4\/full\/ncb2926.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureCellBio","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncb\/journal\/v16\/n4\/full\/ncb2926.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24658686"],"pmid":"24658686","pubdate":"2014-03-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mesenchymal stem cells","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Model vertebrates","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Differentiation","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The role of differential VE-cadherin dynamics in cell rearrangement during angiogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-differential-vecadherin-dynamics-cell-rearrangement-during-angiogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":40.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":40.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229837,"mean":5.9666066686203,"rank":144460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":6085208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229837,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133106,"mean":8.1898044250781,"rank":5296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":127803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133106,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2278,"mean":9.1120017566974,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":2187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2278,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":12.200936170213,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":57,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
