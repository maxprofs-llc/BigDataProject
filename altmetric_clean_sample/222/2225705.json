The objectives of our population-based study were to describe >3-decade-long trends in the clinical features, treatment practices, and long-term outcomes of young adults aged 35 to 54\u00a0years discharged from the hospital after AMI. The study population consisted of 2,142 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area who were hospitalized with AMI at all central Massachusetts medical centers during 16 annual periods from 1975 to 2007. Our primarily male study population had an average age of 47\u00a0years. Patients hospitalized during the most recent decade (1997 to 2007) under study were more likely to have a history of hypertension and heart failure than those hospitalized during earlier study years. Patients were less likely to have developed heart failure or stroke during their hospitalization in the most recent compared with the initial decade under study (heart failure 13.7% and stroke 0.7% vs 20.9% and 2.0%, respectively). One- and 2-year postdischarge death rates also decreased significantly between 1975 to 1986 (6.2% and 9.0%, respectively) and 1988 to 1995 (2.6% and 4.9%). These trends were concomitant with the increasing use of effective cardiac therapies and coronary interventions during hospitalization. The present results provide insights into the changing characteristics, management, and improving long-term outcomes of relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f0","authors":["Tisminetzky, Mayra","McManus, David D.","Gore, Joel M.","Yarzebski, Jorge","Coles, Andrew","Lessard, Darleen","Goldberg, Robert J."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjcard.2013.12.020","first_seen_on":"2014-03-31T19:01:42+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["0002-9149"],"journal":"American Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1396291201,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(14)00046-0\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(14)00046-0\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajconline.org\/article\/S0002-9149(14)00046-0\/pdf","pmid":"24507173","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"30-Year Trends in Patient Characteristics, Treatment Practices, and Long-Term Outcomes of Adults Aged 35 to 54\u00a0Years Hospitalized With Acute Myocardial Infarction","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/30year-trends-patient-characteristics-treatment-practices-longterm-outcomes-adults-aged-35-54-years-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":438050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":3178896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93071,"mean":7.0018758998604,"rank":13407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":78955,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93071,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2365,"mean":3.0970972927242,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2365,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":2.3861111111111,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Post-discharge deaths drop in young acute MI patients","url":"http:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/news\/2014-03-post-discharge-deaths-young-acute-mi.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[2225705],"posted_on":"2014-03-31T18:40:01+00:00","summary":"(HealthDay)\u2014In the most recent decade, compared with earlier decades, post-discharge death rates have dropped for young adults hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), according to research published in the April 1 issue of The American Journal","author":{"name":"MedicalXpress","url":"http:\/\/medicalxpress.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/152\/normal\/image.png?1369925783"}}]}}
