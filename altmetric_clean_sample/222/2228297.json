(M. Auer)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Stabilization of protein-protein interactions by small molecules is a concept with few examples reported to date. Herein we describe the identification and X-ray co-crystal structure determination of IBE-667, an ICAM-1 binding enhancer for LFA-1. IBE-667 was designed based on the SAR information obtained from an on-bead screen of tagged one-bead one-compound combinatorial libraries by confocal nanoscanning and bead picking (CONA). Cellular assays demonstrate the activity of IBE-667 in promoting the binding of LFA-1 on activated immune cells to ICAM-1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Hintersteiner M","Kallen J","Schmied M","Graf C","Jung T","Mudd G","Shave S","Gstach H","Auer M","Hintersteiner, Martin","Kallen, J\u00f6rg","Schmied, Mario","Graf, Christine","Jung, Thomas","Mudd, Gemma","Shave, Steven","Gstach, Hubert","Auer, Manfred","Martin Hintersteiner","J\u00f6rg Kallen","Mario Schmied","Christine Graf","Thomas Jung","Gemma Mudd","Steven Shave","Hubert Gstach","Manfred Auer"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201310240","endpage":"4326","first_seen_on":"2014-04-01T13:36:23+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc","bbsrc"],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851","14337851"],"issue":"17","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
