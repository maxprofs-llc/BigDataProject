Whereas glial cells remain electrically coupled at postnatal stages, adult vertebrate neurons were thought to communicate mainly via chemical synapses. There is now accumulating evidence that in certain neuronal cell populations the capacity for electrical signaling by gap junction channels is still present in the adult. Here we identified electrically coupled pairs of neurons between postnatal days 12 and 18 in rat visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus. Notably, coupling was found both between pairs of inhibitory neurons and between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Molecular analysis by single-cell reverse transcription-PCR revealed a differential expression pattern of connexins in these identified neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2000PNAS...9710260V","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Laurent Venance","Andrei Rozov","Maria Blatow","Nail Burnashev","Dirk Feldmeyer","Hannah Monyer"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.160037097","first_seen_on":"2014-03-30T13:04:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1396184618,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/97\/18\/10260.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/97\/18\/10260.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC27858","pmid":"10944183","pubdate":"2000-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"10260","subjects":["science"],"title":"Connexin expression in electrically coupled postnatal rat brain neurons","type":"article","volume":"97","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/connexin-expression-electrically-coupled-postnatal-rat-brain-neurons-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3062615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":941782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107289,"mean":7.9906002721649,"rank":73067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107289,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37412,"mean":15.349847478015,"rank":32274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":3512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37412,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":978,"mean":36.125766632549,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":978,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
