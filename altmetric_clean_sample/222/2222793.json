The application of this methodology in the asymmetric synthesis of a range of C(5)-substituted 1,2-anti-1,5-syn-transpentacins was demonstrated by the rearrangement of a range of \u03b2-amino esters derived from sorbic acid, followed by esterification, ring-closing metathesis, hydrogenolytic deprotection\/reduction, and hydrolysis, which gave the C(5)-substituted transpentacins in only 9 steps from commercially available starting materials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Stephen G.
