With regards to 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, a C2 allyl group is detrimental to activity. The chiral center of nantenine is not important for 5-HT2A antagonist activity, however the N6 nitrogen atom is a critical feature for 5-HT2A antagonism. Compound 12b was the most potent 5-HT2A aporphine antagonist identified in this study and has similar potency to previously identified aporphine antagonists 2 and 3. The ring A and N6 modifications examined were detrimental to \u03b11A antagonism. A slight eutomeric preference for the R enantiomer of nantenine was observed in relation to \u03b11A antagonism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.02.066","first_seen_on":"2014-03-31T15:27:39+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0960894X"],"journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1396279631,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960894X1400198X"],"pmid":"24630561","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Evaluation of structural effects on 5-HT2A receptor antagonism by aporphines: Identification of a new aporphine with 5-HT2A antagonist activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-structural-effects-5ht2a-receptor-antagonism-aporphines-identification-new-aporphine-5ht2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2897997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92886,"mean":7.0072483824085,"rank":73711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92886,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1270,"mean":2.14775571316,"rank":851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1270,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.0903846153846,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
