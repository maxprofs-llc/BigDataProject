Trap efficiency, represented by the inventory of (137)Cs in pond sediment to the inventory of radiocesium in soil surrounding the pond (i.e., total (137)Cs inventory), was less than 100% for all but one pond. Trap efficiency decreased as sediment particle size increased, indicating that sediments with a smaller particle size accumulate more (137)Cs. In ponds showing low trap efficiency, fine sediment containing high concentrations of (137)Cs appeared to be removed from the system by hydraulic flushing, leaving behind mostly coarse sediment. The results of this study suggest that sediment particle size can be used to estimate the initial accumulation and trap efficiency of (137)Cs in pond sediment, as well as the amount lost through hydraulic flushing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Kazuya Yoshimura","Yuichi Onda","Takehiko Fukushima"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep04514","first_seen_on":"2014-04-01T13:48:20+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1396865005,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140331\/srep04514\/full\/srep04514.html?WT.ec_id=SREP-704-20140401","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep04514","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2014\/140331\/srep04514\/full\/srep04514.html"],"pmid":"24682011","pubdate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental monitoring","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Limnology","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Sediment particle size and initial radiocesium accumulation in ponds following the Fukushima DNPP accident","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sediment-particle-size-initial-radiocesium-accumulation-ponds-following-fukushima-dnpp-accident"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2315781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2593106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123511,"mean":8.1404801716464,"rank":51136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":68562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123511,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15807,"mean":13.321162723017,"rank":7630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":7635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15807,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":693,"mean":8.0389335260116,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":693,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
