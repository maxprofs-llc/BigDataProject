However, Jaspers' account of the epistemological role of empathy in psychopathological diagnosis was far from clear: whereas at several places Jaspers claimed that empathy provides a direct access to patients' abnormal mental experiences, at other places he stressed that it did so only indirectly, through a whole battery of their observable clinical indicators. The aim of this paper is to reassess Jaspers' account of the epistemological role of empathy in psychopathological diagnosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000889","authors":["Panagiotis Oulis"],"doi":"10.1186\/1747-5341-9-6","first_seen_on":"2014-03-29T17:31:02+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1747-5341",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1399874865,"links":["http:\/\/www.peh-med.com\/content\/9\/1\/6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24636777"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.peh-med.com\/content\/pdf\/1747-5341-9-6.pdf","pmid":"24636777","pubdate":"2014-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"6","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"The epistemological role of empathy in psychopathological diagnosis: a contemporary reassessment of Karl Jaspers\u2019 account","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epistemological-role-empathy-psychopathological-diagnosis-contemporary-reassessment-karl-jaspers-acc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8354949,"mean":7.0463351759862,"rank":569261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7784706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8354949,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178512,"mean":7.6564187304987,"rank":14822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":163654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178512,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":12.284175675676,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.075,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
