Participants were asked if they had experienced wheezing in the past year and if they had ever been given a diagnosis of asthma by a doctor. Serum total IgE and house dust mite (HDM) specific IgE were measured.\nWheeze in the past year without an asthma diagnosis was more common in men and older age groups, whereas wheeze with an asthma diagnosis was more common in women and younger people. Both types of wheeze were more common in the lower social classes, among ex-smokers and current smokers, and in urban areas. Thirty two percent of people reporting wheezing and 22% of those with diagnosed asthma had neither raised total IgE nor HDM IgE. Among the non-atopic subjects the prevalence of wheeze rose with age and lower social class, largely due to an increase in wheeze without diagnosed asthma. In contrast, among atopic subjects there was no overall trend with age or social class, but wheeze with diagnosed asthma decreased with age.\nClear epidemiological differences are evident between adult wheeze with and without an asthma diagnosis and between atopic and non-atopic wheeze. Subjects with diagnosed asthma are more likely to be atopic, but the results challenge the premise that adult asthma is almost always associated with some IgE mediated reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003664","authors":["C S Court","D G Cook","D P Strachan"],"doi":"10.1136\/thorax.57.11.951","endpage":"957","first_seen_on":"2017-01-13T10:40:57+00:00","issns":["0040-6376","1468-3296"],"issue":"11","journal":"Thorax","last_mentioned_on":1209946973,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/thorax.57.11.951"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/57\/11\/951.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1746228","pmid":"12403877","pubdate":"2002-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"951","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Comparative epidemiology of atopic and non-atopic wheeze and diagnosed asthma in a national sample of English adults","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-epidemiology-atopic-nonatopic-wheeze-diagnosed-asthma-national-sample-english-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6967545,"mean":6.2323037179212,"rank":1628706,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4535977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6967545,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98005,"mean":11.07413766785,"rank":29583,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":66897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98005,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2175,"mean":9.3961775528979,"rank":948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":950,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2175,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":65.01275862069,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
