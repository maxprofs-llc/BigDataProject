A third family, of Western European descent, included a child with febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) who also had compound heterozygous missense mutations in SCN10A, namely, c.3482T>C; p.Met1161Thr and c.4709C>A; p.Thr1570Lys. A search for SCN10A variants in three consortia datasets (EuroEPINOMICS, Epi4K\/EPGP, Autism\/dbGaP) identified an additional five individuals with compound heterozygous variants. A Hispanic male with infantile spasms [c.2842G>C; p.Val948Leu and c.1453C>T; p.Arg485Cys], and a Caucasian female with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [c.1529C>T; p.Pro510Leu and c.4984G>A; p.Gly1662Ser] in the epilepsy databases and three in the autism databases with [c.4009T>A; p.Ser1337Thr and c.1141A>G; p.Ile381Val], [c.2972C>T; p.Pro991Leu and c.2470C>T; p.His824Tyr], and [c.4009T>A; p.Ser1337Thr and c.2052G>A; p.Met684Ile].\nSCN10A is a member of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene family. Sodium channels are responsible for the instigation and proliferation of action potentials in central and peripheral nervous systems. Heterozygous mutations in VGSC genes cause a wide range of epileptic and peripheral nervous system disorders. This report presents autosomal recessive mutations in SCN10A that may be linked to epilepsy-related phenotypes, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, infantile spasms, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.","altmetric_jid":"53222bcf2a83eefa4a8b4567","authors":["Kambouris, Marios","Thevenon, Julien","Soldatos, Ariane","Cox, Allison","Stephen, Joshi","Ben-Omran, Tawfeg","Al-Sarraj, Yasser","Boulos, Hala","Bone, William","Mullikin, James C",", ","Masurel-Paulet, Alice","St-Onge, Judith","Dufford, Yannis","Chantegret, Corrine","Thauvin-Robinet, Christel","Al-Alami, Jamil","Faivre, Laurence","Riviere, Jean Baptiste","Gahl, William A","Bassuk, Alexander G","Malicdan, May Christine V","El-Shanti, Hatem","Ben\u2010Omran, Tawfeg","Al\u2010Sarraj, Yasser","Mullikin, James C.","Masurel\u2010Paulet, Alice","St\u2010Onge, Judith","Thauvin\u2010Robinet, Christel","Al\u2010Alami, Jamil","Gahl, William A.","Bassuk, Alexander G.","Malicdan, May Christine V.","El\u2010Shanti,\n Hatem"],"doi":"10.1002\/acn3.372","endpage":"35","first_seen_on":"2017-01-13T11:38:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2328-9503","23289503"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1484898567,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28078312","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/acn3.372\/abstract;jsessionid=D4818B5E29F34CF06E60CAFCB6FDDA91.f02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/acn3.372\/pdf","pmid":"28078312","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"26","title":"\n              Biallelic\n              SCN10A\n              mutations in neuromuscular disease and epileptic encephalopathy\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/acn3.372","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biallelic-iscn10ai-mutations-neuromuscular-disease-epileptic-encephalopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088896,"mean":6.8703833603893,"rank":3799596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4109580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088896,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256960,"mean":12.79039202363,"rank":124212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":125716,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256960,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277,"mean":13.081311594203,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.6145714285714,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CH":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IngoHelbig\/statuses\/819871106819571712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15448562],"posted_on":"2017-01-13T11:37:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Ingo Helbig","url":"http:\/\/channelopathist.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/112216407\/Picture_1_normal.png","description":"Child Neurology resident, epilepsy genetics researcher & bioinformatics rookie, neuroblogger wannabe","id_on_source":"IngoHelbig","tweeter_id":"27087967","geo":{"lt":39.95234,"ln":-75.16379,"country":"US"},"followers":469},"tweet_id":"819871106819571712"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sebasortizdelar\/statuses\/819872153529188352","license":"gnip","rt":["IngoHelbig"],"citation_ids":[15448562],"posted_on":"2017-01-13T11:42:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Sebastian Ortiz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681512796044046337\/WGvbFObg_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurologist -
