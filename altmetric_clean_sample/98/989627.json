Prophylactic immunization with Vaxfectin(\u00ae)-gD2\/UL46\/UL47 significantly reduced viral replication in the genital tract, provided complete protection against both primary and recurrent genital skin disease following intravaginal HSV-2 challenge, and significantly reduced latent HSV-2 DNA in the dorsal root ganglia compared to controls. We also examined the impact of therapeutic immunization of HSV-2 infected animals. Here, Vaxfectin(\u00ae)-gD2\/UL46\/UL47 immunization significantly reduced both the frequency of recurrent disease and viral shedding into the genital tract compared to controls. This novel adjuvanted pDNA vaccine has demonstrated both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the guinea pig model of genital herpes and warrants further development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["Ron L.
