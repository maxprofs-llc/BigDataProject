Importantly, this synthetic approach can be extended to the synthesis of \u03c3-alane complexes through the use of hydride-containing transition metal nucleophiles. Cp'Mn(CO)(2)-[H(Cl)Al{(N(i)Pr)(2)CPh}] synthesized via this route features an alane ligand bound in a more 'side-on' fashion than other alane complexes, although DFT calculations imply that the potential energy surface associated with variation in the Mn-H-Al angle is a very soft one.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Simon Aldridge","Ian M.
