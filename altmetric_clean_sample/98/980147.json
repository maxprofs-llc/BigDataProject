Haplotypes can provide insights into underlying linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure and can tag uncommon variants that are not well tagged by common variants. In this work, we propose a wei-SIMc-matching test that inversely weights haplotype similarities with the estimated standard deviation of haplotype counts to boost the power of similarity-based approaches for detecting uncommon causal variants. We then compare the power of the wei-SIMc-matching test with that of several popular haplotype-based tests, including four other similarity-based tests, a global score test for haplotypes (global), a test based on the maximum score statistic over all haplotypes (max), and two newly proposed haplotype-based tests for rare variant detection. With systematic simulations under a wide range of LD patterns, the results show that wei-SIMc-matching and global are the two most powerful tests. Among these two tests, wei-SIMc-matching has reliable asymptotic P-values, whereas global needs permutations to obtain reliable P-values when the frequencies of some haplotype categories are low or when the trait is skewed. Therefore, we recommend wei-SIMc-matching for detecting uncommon causal variants with surrounding common SNPs, in light of its power and computational feasibility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751e","authors":["Lin, Wan\u2010Yu","Yi, Nengjun","Zhi, Degui","Zhang, Kui","Gao, Guimin","Tiwari, Hemant K.","Liu, Nianjun"],"doi":"10.1002\/gepi.21650","endpage":"582","first_seen_on":"2012-10-03T22:55:00+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1098-2272","0741-0395"],"issue":"6","journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1349304893,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.21650\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.21650\/pdf","pmid":"22706849","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"572","subjects":["epidemiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Haplotype\u00e2\u0080\u0090Based Methods for Detecting Uncommon Causal Variants With Common SNPs","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/haplotypebased-methods-detecting-uncommon-causal-variants-common-snps"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6695002,"mean":6.1599261935862,"rank":3208642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1989397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6695002,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96377,"mean":5.6430570473977,"rank":44246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":39528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96377,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":381,"mean":2.6543315789474,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":381,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
