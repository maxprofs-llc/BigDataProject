An audit was conducted on food and beverage television advertisements broadcast in five major Australian cities during children's programming time from 1st September 2010 to 31st October 2010. The data were assessed against mandatory and voluntary advertising regulations, the information contained in an industry report of breaches, and the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Michele Roberts","Simone Pettigrew","Kathy Chapman","Caroline Miller","Pascale Quester","Roberts M","Pettigrew S","Chapman K","Miller C","Quester P"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-12-846","first_seen_on":"2012-10-05T15:11:58+00:00","handle":"2440\/76724","handles":["2440\/76724"],"issns":["1471-2458",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1413314984,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/846\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/846","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/846\/","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-846"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-846?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"23039855","pubdate":"2012-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"846","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Compliance with children\u2019s television food advertising regulations in Australia","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-12-846","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compliance-childrens-television-food-advertising-regulations-australia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072403,"mean":6.8502089083235,"rank":608590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7460656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072403,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103198,"mean":5.9628845412173,"rank":7758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":95384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103198,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6935,"mean":8.94135102394,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6935,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293,"mean":4.2721438356164,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
