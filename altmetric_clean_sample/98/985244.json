Synthetic highlights include a Ni-catalyzed Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi coupling between an aldehyde and a Z vinyl iodide to assemble the two main fragments, a diastereoselective Myers alkylation, a stereoselective Evans aldolization, two asymmetric Duthaler crotyltitanations, and a stereoselective Pd-catalyzed Marshall allenylindium addition to install the stereogenic centers of dictyostatin. The synthesis of (9R)-epi-dictyostatin and a new ring-contracted dictyostatin isomer were also achieved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Gallon, Julien","Esteban, Jorge","Bouzbouz\u2009, Samir","Campbell, Matthew","Reymond, S\u00e9bastien","Cossy, Janine"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201201001","endpage":"11797","first_seen_on":"2012-10-06T07:15:48+00:00","issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"37","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1349507743,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201201001\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201201001\/pdf","pmid":"22865684","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"11788","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Formal Synthesis of Dictyostatin and Synthesis of Two Dictyostatin Analogues","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formal-synthesis-dictyostatin-synthesis-two-dictyostatin-analogues"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6656022,"mean":6.1596756128,"rank":4923557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":976223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6656022,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96251,"mean":5.6485296831169,"rank":61249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96251,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4371,"mean":3.0601249427918,"rank":2516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4371,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.7322962962963,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
