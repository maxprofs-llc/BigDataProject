Unlike the conventional negative charged single metal cluster, the use of the neutral mixed metal cluster as nodes in the framework avoids the need of a compensating anion inside the porous MIL-88B system; thus the mixed metal MIL-88B becomes porous. The flexibility of the mixed metal MIL-88B can be controlled by terminal ligands with different steric hindrance. This allows us to reversibly customize the porosity of the MIL-88B structure at three levels of specific surface area as well as the pore volume.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Gia-Thanh Vuong","Minh-Hao Pham","Trong-On Do"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt32073h","endpage":"557","first_seen_on":"2012-10-06T19:40:10+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"2","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1349552402,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32073h"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32073h","pmid":"23086076","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"550","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and Engineering Porosity of mixed metal Fe2Ni MIL-88B Metal-Organic Framework","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-engineering-porosity-mixed-metal-fe-sub2sub-ni-mil88b-metalorganic-framework"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3543648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79993,"mean":5.4848684368437,"rank":61980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79993,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0186788577154,"rank":5443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
