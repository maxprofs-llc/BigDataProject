The most recent revision of the American Joint Committee on Cancer melanoma staging system now incorporates MR and specifies that MR should be reported as mitoses per mm(2), with a conversion factor of 1 mm(2) equaling 4 hpf. However, because many pathologists continue to report MR in hpf units, we sought to compare the 2 conventions for reporting MR; this is important now that MR is used for staging and prognostic information.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2012.05.021","first_seen_on":"2012-10-06T10:02:49+00:00","issns":["1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1355372051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23036603?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23036603","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Assessment of mitotic rate reporting in melanoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-mitotic-rate-reporting-melanoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2939035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79992,"mean":5.484858871623,"rank":49186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79992,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1219,"mean":2.0126880131363,"rank":579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1219,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":5.515,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/TJH0828\/status\/279076728691884032","license":"public","citation_ids":[985362],"posted_on":"2012-12-13T04:14:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Tina J Hieken MD","url":"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/bio\/15589811.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1803942806\/TJH_1208_md_photo_5_normal.jpg","description":"Surgical Oncologist\r\n- Opinions are mine #breastcancer #melanoma - like #data","id_on_source":"TJH0828","tweeter_id":"293182860","geo":{"lt":44.02163,"ln":-92.4699,"country":"US"},"followers":1605},"tweet_id":"279076728691884032"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/254522025169793024","license":"public","citation_ids":[985362],"posted_on":"2012-10-06T10:02:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"254522025169793024"}]}}
