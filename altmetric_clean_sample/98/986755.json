Biopterin concentrations were 124 \u00b1 12.3 \u00b5mol\/mol creatinine in workers and 88 \u00b1 5.7 \u00b5mol\/mol creatinine in controls whereas kynurenine concentrations were 1.75 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5M and 1.95 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b5M, respectively (both, p < 0.05). It can be claimed that enhanced biopterin and diminished kynurenine levels may play a triggering role in disruption of metabolic events in operating room personnel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649f","authors":["Mustafa Baydar","Zeynep Capan","Gozde Girgin","S.
