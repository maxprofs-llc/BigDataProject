A series of aporphines were docked into a homology model of the rat 5-HT(2A) receptor using AutoDock. Selected compounds with high in silico binding affinities were screened in vitro using radioligand-binding assays against rat serotonin (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A)) and dopamine (D1 and D2) receptors. (R)-Roemerine and (\u00b1)-nuciferine were found to have high affinity for the 5-HT(2A) receptor (K(i) = 62 and 139 nM, respectively), with (R)-roemerine showing 20- to 400-fold selectivity for the 5-HT(2A) receptor over the 5-HT(1A), D1 and D2 receptors. Investigation into the ligand-receptor interactions suggested that the selectivity of (R)-roemerine is due to it having stronger H-bonding and dipole-dipole interactions with several of the key residues in the 5-HT(2A) receptor-binding site.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e1","authors":["Munusamy, Vani","Yap, Beow Keat","Buckle, Michael J.
