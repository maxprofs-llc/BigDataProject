RDTs must, therefore, be as simple, safe and reliable as possible. Transfer of blood from the patient to the RDT is critical to safety and accuracy, and poses a significant challenge to many users. Blood transfer devices were evaluated for accuracy and precision of volume transferred, safety and ease of use, to identify the most appropriate devices for use with RDTs in routine clinical care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Heidi Hopkins","Wellington Oyibo","Jennifer Luchavez","Mary Lorraine Mationg","Caroline Asiimwe","Audrey Albertini","Iveth J Gonz\u00e1lez","Michelle L Gatton","David Bell","Hopkins H","Oyibo W","Luchavez J","Mationg ML","Asiimwe C","Albertini A","Gonz\u00e1lez IJ","Gatton ML","Bell D"],"doi":"10.1186\/1475-2875-10-30","first_seen_on":"2012-10-08T00:19:11+00:00","issns":["","1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1346310689,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/30","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1475-2875-10-30"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/1475-2875-10-30.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3041722","pmid":"21303528","pubdate":"2011-02-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"30","title":"Blood transfer devices for malaria rapid diagnostic tests: evaluation of accuracy, safety and ease of use","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-transfer-devices-malaria-rapid-diagnostic-tests-evaluation-accuracy-safety-ease-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":3255595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":878976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81131,"mean":5.7834876864292,"rank":52593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81131,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1833,"mean":3.9979923580786,"rank":1464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1833,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.0362903225806,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"linkedin":[{"title":"Does anyone have a recommendation for a device which will collect a small quantity of blood from a finger stick and deliver a metered amount to an LFI test cassette?","url":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/groupItem?view=&gid=3184001&item=139252889&type=member&trk=api*a215519*s223511*#g-3184001-S-139252889-93244169","citation_ids":[986890],"posted_on":"2012-08-30T07:11:29+00:00","summary":"You might want to read this article :\r  http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/10\/1\/30\r  \r  and have a look here \r  http:\/\/www.finddiagnostics.org\/programs\/malaria-afs\/malaria\/product_development\/improved-blood-transfer-device.html:","author":{"name":"Audrey A.","description":"Scientific Officer at FIND Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics","group_name":"Devices and applications for lateral-flow immunodiagnostics","group_description":"Purpose of this group is to bring together interested parties who are developing lateral flow tests and discuss their needs and requirements."}}]}}
