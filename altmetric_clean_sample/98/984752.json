Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) protects pancreatic islets against cytokine-induced apoptosis. For this reason, we assessed whether CNTF protects mice against streptozotocin-induced diabetes (a model of type 1 diabetes) and the mechanism for this protection. WT and SOCS3 knockdown C57BL6 mice were treated for 5 days with citrate buffer or 0.1 mg\/kg CNTF before receiving 80 mg\/kg streptozotocin. Glycemia in non-fasted mice was measured weekly from days 0-28 after streptozotocin administration. Diabetes was defined as a blood glucose > 11.2 mmol\/liter. Wild-type (WT) and SOCS3 knockdown MIN6 cells were cultured with CNTF, IL1\u03b2, or both. CNTF reduced diabetes incidence and islet apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd mice. Likewise, CNTF inhibited apoptosis in WT but not in SOCS3kd MIN6 cells. CNTF increased STAT3 phosphorylation in WT and SOCS3kd mice and MIN6 cells but reduced STAT1 phosphorylation only in WT mice, in contrast to streptozotocin and IL1\u03b2. Moreover, CNTF reduced NF\u03baB activation and required down-regulation of inducible NO synthase expression to exert its protective effects. In conclusion, CNTF protects mice against streptozotocin-induced diabetes by increasing pancreatic islet survival, and this protection depends on SOCS3. In addition, SOCS3 expression and \u03b2-cell fate are dependent on STAT1\/STAT3 ratio.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Antonio C.
