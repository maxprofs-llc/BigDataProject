Fortunately, the recent development of a PD disease model using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides access to cell types that were previously unobtainable in sufficient quantity or quality, and presents exciting promises for the elucidation of PD etiology and the development of potential therapeutics. To more effectively model PD, we generated two patient-derived iPSC lines: a line carrying a homozygous p.G2019S mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene and another carrying a full gene triplication of the \u03b1-synuclein encoding gene, SNCA. We demonstrated that these PD-linked pluripotent lines were able to differentiate into DA neurons and that these neurons exhibited increased expression of key oxidative stress response genes and \u03b1-synuclein protein. Moreover, when compared to wild-type DA neurons, LRRK2-G2019S iPSC-derived DA neurons were more sensitive to caspase-3 activation caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide, MG-132, and 6-hydroxydopamine. In addition, SNCA-triplication iPSC-derived DA neurons formed early ubiquitin-positive puncta and were more sensitive to peak toxicity from hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. These aforementioned findings suggest that LRRK2-G2019S and SNCA-triplication iPSC-derived DA neurons exhibit early phenotypes linked to PD. Given the high penetrance of the homozygous LRRK2 mutation, the expression of wild-type \u03b1-synuclein protein in the SNCA-triplication line, and the clinical resemblance of patients afflicted with these familial disorders to sporadic PD patients, these iPSC-derived neurons may be unique and valuable models for disease diagnostics and development of novel pharmacological agents for alleviation of relevant disease phenotypes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007063","authors":["Blake Byers","Hsiao-lu Lee","Renee Reijo Pera"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11910-012-0270-y","first_seen_on":"2012-10-08T20:19:07+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1528-4042"],"issue":"3","journal":"Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports","last_mentioned_on":1349700540,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3342500\/"],"pmid":"22538490","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"237","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Modeling Parkinson\u2019s Disease Using Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modeling-parkinsons-disease-using-induced-pluripotent-stem-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.616,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.616},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":535801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3149544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77069,"mean":5.1712287071157,"rank":11308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":65761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77069,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4744545454545,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Doctoral Student":12,"Student  > Ph.
