Also, CD27-expression on tuberculin-activated IFN-\u03b3(+) CD4 T-cells is known to differ significantly between patients with active pulmonary TB and healthy TB-unexposed BCG vaccinees. Here, we explore links between CD4 T-cell phenotype, multiple functional subsets, and control of TB.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000709b","authors":["Streitz, Mathias","Fuhrmann, Stephan","Thomas, David","Cheek, Elizabeth","Nomura, Laurel","Maecker, Holden","Martus, Peter","Aghaeepour, Nima","Brinkman, Ryan R","Volk, Hans\u2010Dieter","Kern, Florian","Mathias Streitz","Stephan Fuhrmann","David Thomas","Elizabeth Cheek","Laurel Nomura","Holden Maecker","Peter Martus","Nima Aghaeepour","Ryan R Brinkman","Hans-Dieter Volk","Florian Kern"],"doi":"10.1002\/cyto.b.21041","endpage":"368","first_seen_on":"2012-10-08T19:38:56+00:00","issns":["1552-4957","1552-4949","15524949"],"issue":"6","journal":"Cytometry Part B: Clinical Cytometry","last_mentioned_on":1365604147,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cyto.b.21041\/abstract;jsessionid=B255817B0F10AD50CC57EADB11D01FFD.d03t01?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+15+September+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/cyto.b.21041"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cyto.b.21041\/pdf","pmid":"22961735","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"360","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The phenotypic distribution and functional profile of tuberculin\u00e2\u0080\u0090specific CD4 T\u00e2\u0080\u0090cells characterizes different stages of TB infection","type":"article","volume":"82B","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenotypic-distribution-functional-profile-tuberculinspecific-cd4-tcells-characterizes-different-sta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616387,"mean":4.9300280987737,"rank":1808286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1632127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616387,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76747,"mean":5.2267047663721,"rank":31287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":40837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76747,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":1.6407594936709,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
