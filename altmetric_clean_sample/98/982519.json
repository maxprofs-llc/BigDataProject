The phrase 'potential supernumerary embryos' is used to indicate that PGD is typically performed on a set of embryos, only some of which will be implanted. Prior to any testing, each embryo in the set is potentially supernumerary in the sense that it may not be selected for implantation. Those embryos that are not selected, and hence destroyed or frozen, are 'actually supernumerary'. The argument to be advanced is hypothetical: If embryos may be said to benefit or be harmed by our actions, then PGD used to select for an embryo or embryos with the highest expected Wellbeing benefits potential supernumerary embryos. The argument shows that the 'non-identity' problem is not sufficient to show that eugenic selection does not benefit supernumerary embryos.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cc","authors":["Walker, Mark","WALKER, MARK"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2012.02000.x","endpage":"224","first_seen_on":"2012-10-05T02:51:02+00:00","issns":["1467-8519","0269-9702"],"issue":"5","journal":"Bioethics","last_mentioned_on":1399261025,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2012.02000.x\/abstract;jsessionid=ECFA0554F795CFBC437A7F0C815436A7.d04t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2012.02000.x\/abstract;jsessionid=A12AA94C2F63EF3272C0B028ABA79BCF.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8519.2012.02000.x\/pdf","pmid":"22845885","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"214","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"EUGENIC SELECTION BENEFITS EMBRYOS","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/eugenic-selection-benefits-embryos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7599664,"mean":6.5471410587506,"rank":5750877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1020037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7599664,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100754,"mean":5.7515426041905,"rank":65699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":19341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100754,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":607,"mean":5.2651518151815,"rank":432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":607,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/futuramiah\/status\/463160427329757184","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[982519],"posted_on":"2014-05-05T03:37:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Andy Android","url":"http:\/\/www.andymiah.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/744865841599160320\/yTTwVJ4C_normal.jpg","description":"I am an experimental dreamspace dedicated to Prof Andy Miah.
