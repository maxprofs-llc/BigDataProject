One novel gene differentially expressed was identified through quantitative real time PCR and the cDNA complete sequence was then obtained using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. The nucleotide sequence of the gene is not homologous to any of the known porcine genes. The sequence prediction analysis revealed that the open reading frame of this gene encodes a protein of 507 amino acids that shares high homology with the protection of telomeres 1 isoform 4 (POT1) of human (86%)-so that this gene can be defined as swine POT1 gene. This gene is structured in 12 exons and 11 introns as revealed by computer-assisted analysis. The tissue expression analysis indicated that the swine POT1 gene is differentially expressed in tissues including muscle, heart, liver, fat, kidney, lung, pancreas and spleen. Our experiment is the first to establish the primary foundation for further research on the swine POT1 gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c4","authors":["Yong WJ","Jing L","Jiugang Z","Lei C","Yonggang L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cyto.2012.03.028","first_seen_on":"2012-10-08T06:40:36+00:00","issns":["1043-4666"],"issue":"","journal":"Cytokine","last_mentioned_on":1349678430,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22537851?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22537851","pubdate":"2012-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"A novel porcine gene, POT1, differentially expressed in the longissimus muscle tissues from Wujin and Large White pigs.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-porcine-gene-pot1-differentially-expressed-longissimus-muscle-tissues-wujin-large-white-pigs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3081499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":963419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80378,"mean":5.4850360177663,"rank":52243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80378,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":589,"mean":1.559880952381,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":589,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.0357142857143,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
