Sample Prep"],"citation":{"abstract":"Tyrosine hydroxylase is a mononuclear non-heme iron monooxygenase found in the central nervous system that catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to yield L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters. Catalysis requires the binding of tyrosine, a tetrahydropterin and O2 at an active site that consists of a ferrous ion coordinated fac by the side-chains of two histidines and a glutamate. We used nitric oxide as a surrogate for O2 to poise the active site iron in an S=3\/2 {FeNO}7 form that is amenable to EPR spectroscopy. The pulsed EPR method of Hyperfine Sublevel Correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopy was then used to probe the ligands at the remaining labile coordination sites on iron. For the complex formed by the addition of tyrosine and nitric oxide, TyrH\/NO\/tyr, orientation-selective HYSCORE studies provided evidence for the coordination of one H2O molecule characterized by proton isotropic hyperfine couplings, Aiso = 0.0 \u00b1 0.3 MHz, and dipolar couplings, T = 4.4 and 4.5 (\u00b1 0.2) MHz. These data showed complex HYSCORE cross peak contours that required the addition of a third coupled proton, characterized by Aiso = 2.0 MHz, T = 3.8 MHz, to the analysis. This proton hyperfine coupling differed from those measured previously for H2O bound to {FeNO}7 model complexes and was assigned to a hydroxide ligand. For the complex formed by the addition of tyrosine, 6-methyltetrahydropterin and NO, TyrH\/NO\/tyr\/6-MPH4, the HYSCORE cross peaks attributed to H2O and OH- for the TyrH\/NO\/tyr complex were replaced by a cross peak due to a single proton characterized by Aiso = 0.0 MHz and a dipolar coupling, T = 3.8 MHz. This interaction was assigned to the N5 - proton of the reduced pterin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["John McCracken"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00363","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T15:55:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4995"],"journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1433865299,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.biochem.5b00363"],"pmid":"26024204","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"HYSCORE Analysis of the Effects of Substrates on Coordination of Water to the Active Site Iron in Tyrosine Hydroxylase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyscore-analysis-effects-substrates-coordination-water-active-site-iron-tyrosine-hydroxylase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5208706,"mean":6.1459562601477,"rank":3665406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":872207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5208706,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176530,"mean":8.6900091089851,"rank":124679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32660,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176530,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5798,"mean":2.5582532344316,"rank":4904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5798,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":1.6453725490196,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
