We aimed to demonstrate the relationship between lateral margin status and local recurrence after the endoscopic resection of intramucosal colorectal neoplasms.\nWe retrospectively collected the clinical and pathologic data for 844 endoscopically resected colorectal intramucosal neoplasms with a size of 10\u200amm or larger. We investigated the relationship between the local recurrence rate and the lateral margin status (categorized as LM0 [negative], LM1 [positive], or LMX [indeterminate]).\nIn total, 389 lesions were evaluated as LM0 and showed no local recurrence. Of the 455 lesions evaluated as LMX or LM1, 30 showed local recurrence within a median period of 6.3 months (range, 1.7\u200a-\u200a48.1) from the initial endoscopic resection. The local recurrence rate of the en bloc-LMX group (2.2\u200a%) was significantly lower than that of the piecemeal-LMX group (15.2\u200a%). Of the 30 cases of recurrence, 28 were successfully treated with a second endoscopic resection. Of the two lesions that showed further recurrence, one was treated with a third endoscopic resection, whereas the other - which was a piecemeal-LMX lesion - was eventually diagnosed as invasive cancer and treated with surgery.\nThe local recurrence rate was lower in the en bloc-LMX group than in the piecemeal-LMX group.\u200aThus, we believe that en bloc-LMX lesions that are completely and confidently resected endoscopically can be treated as en bloc-LM0 lesions.","altmetric_jid":"565496cd2a83ee7c2d8b456a","authors":["Makomo Makazu","Taku Sakamoto","Eriko So","Yosuke Otake","Takeshi Nakajima","Takahisa Matsuda","Ryoji Kushima","Yutaka Saito"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0034-1391853","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T00:11:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2364-3722","2196-9736"],"issue":"3","journal":"Endoscopy International Open","last_mentioned_on":1432818002,"links":["https:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/html\/10.1055\/s-0034-1391853"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thieme-connect.de\/products\/ejournals\/pdf\/10.1055\/s-0034-1391853.pdf","pmid":"26171439","pubdate":"2015-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG","title":"Relationship between indeterminate or positive lateral margin and local recurrence after endoscopic resection of colorectal polyps","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-indeterminate-positive-lateral-margin-local-recurrence-after-endoscopic-resecti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5159944,"mean":6.0977348916475,"rank":4290350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5159944,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176059,"mean":8.6463580865398,"rank":143420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176059,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.0224137931034,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.4375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1837562233135064&id=1704082076483081","license":"public","citation_ids":[4126629,4126630,4126631],"posted_on":"2015-05-28T13:00:02+00:00","summary":"News from EIO:\n\nOur 3 featured efirst articles of the month - open access and free to read for everybody!\n \nLong-term results of the mucosal ablation of Barrett's esophagus: efficacy and recurrence by Saligram et al. \nEndoscopic ablation of Barrett\u2019s esoph","author":{"name":"Endoscopy","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1704082076483081","facebook_wall_name":"Endoscopy","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1704082076483081\/picture","id_on_source":"1704082076483081"}}]}}
