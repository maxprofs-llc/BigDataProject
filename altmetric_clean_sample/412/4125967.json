The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence related to spinal immobilisation in pre-hospital and emergency care settings.\nIn February 2015, we performed a systematic literature review of English language publications from 1966 to January 2015 indexed in MEDLINE and Cochrane library using the following search terms: 'spinal injuries' OR 'spinal cord injuries' AND 'emergency treatment' OR 'emergency care' OR 'first aid' AND immobilisation. EMBASE was searched for keywords 'spinal injury OR 'spinal cord injury' OR 'spine fracture AND 'emergency care' OR 'prehospital care'.\nThere were 47 studies meeting inclusion criteria for further review. Ten studies were case series (level of evidence IV) and there were 37 studies from which data were extrapolated from healthy volunteers, cadavers or multiple trauma patients. There were 15 studies that were supportive, 13 studies that were neutral, and 19 studies opposing spinal immobilisation.\nThere are no published high-level studies that assess the efficacy of spinal immobilisation in pre-hospital and emergency care settings. Almost all of the current evidence is related to spinal immobilisation is extrapolated data, mostly from healthy volunteers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005750","authors":["Hood, Natalie","Considine, Julie","Natalie Hood","Julie Considine"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aenj.2015.03.003","endpage":"137","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T21:21:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["15746267","1574-6267","1839-2776"],"issue":"3","journal":"Australasian Emergency Nursing Journal","last_mentioned_on":1459341704,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1574626715000300","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26051883","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.aenj.2015.03.003","http:\/\/www.aenj.com.au\/article\/S1574-6267(15)00030-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.aenj.com.au\/article\/S1574-6267%2815%2900030-0\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=1574-6267_201508_18_3_&amp%3Belsca4=Nursing%7CEmergency+Medicine%7CCritical+Care+Medicine","http:\/\/www.aenj.com.au\/article\/S1574-6267(15)00030-0\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.aenj.com.au\/article\/S1574-6267%2815%2900030-0\/abstract","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aenj.com.au%2Farticle%2FS1574-6267%252815%252900030-0%2Fpdf&code=aenj-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.aenj.com.au\/article\/S1574626715000300\/pdf","pmid":"26051883","pubdate":"2015-06-09T22:02:48+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"118","subjects":["nursing","emergencymedicine"],"title":"Spinal immobilisaton in pre-hospital and emergency care: A systematic review of the literature","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spinal-immobilisaton-prehospital-emergency-care-systematic-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":282822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7182125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218059,"mean":8.1791921048529,"rank":12108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":205930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218059,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":4.6549122807018,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":7.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":3,"practitioner":10},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":9,"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":11,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
