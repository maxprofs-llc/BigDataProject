While agreeing that health has important social determinants, the authors believe that this model has serious shortcomings; they critique the model by focusing on its hidden assumptions. Assumptions about how knowledge is produced and an implicit interest group perspective exclude the sociopolitical and class contexts that shape interest group power and citizen health. Overly rationalist assumptions about change understate the role of agency. The authors review the policy and practice implications of the Canadian population health model and point to alternative ways of viewing the determinants of health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Coburn, David","Denny, Keith","Mykhalovskiy, Eric","McDonough, Peggy","Robertson, Ann","Love, Rhonda"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T07:18:30+00:00","issns":["0090-0036"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1337800920,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12604479"],"pmcid":"PMC1447750","pmid":"12604479","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Population health in Canada: a brief critique.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/population-health-canada-brief-critique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4006952,"mean":5.0321310180817,"rank":919273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2532122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4006952,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115114,"mean":6.9378010425719,"rank":32397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115114,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3912,"mean":9.7528331627431,"rank":1532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3912,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":18.643181818182,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
