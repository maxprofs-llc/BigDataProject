Although GATOR1 complex has been identified as a negative regulator\u00a0for mTORC1 by hydrolyzing RagA(GTP), how GATOR1 is recruited to RagA to attenuate mTORC1 signaling remains unclear. Moreover, how mTORC1 signaling is terminated upon amino acid stimulation\u00a0is also unknown. We show that the recruitment of GATOR1 to RagA is induced by amino acids in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Skp2 E3\u00a0ligase drives K63-linked ubiquitination of RagA, which facilitates GATOR1 recruitment and RagA(GTP) hydrolysis, thereby providing a negative feedback loop to attenuate mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and prevent mTORC1 hyperactivation. We further demonstrate that Skp2 promotes autophagy but\u00a0inhibits cell size and cilia growth through RagA ubiquitination and mTORC1 inhibition. We thereby propose a negative feedback whereby Skp2-mediated RagA ubiquitination recruits GATOR1 to restrict mTORC1 signaling upon sustained amino acid stimulation, which serves a\u00a0critical mechanism to maintain proper cellular functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Jin, Guoxiang","Lee, Szu-Wei","Zhang, Xian","Cai, Zhen","Gao, Yuan","Chou, Ping-Chieh","Rezaeian, Abdol Hossein","Han, Fei","Wang, Chi-Yun","Yao, Juo-Chin","Gong, Zhaohui","Chan, Chia-Hsin","Huang, Chih-Yang","Tsai, Fuu-Jen","Tsai, Chang-Hai","Tu, Shih-Hsin","Wu, Chih-Hsiung","Sarbassov, Dos D","Ho, Yuan-Soon","Lin, Hui-Kuan","Guoxiang Jin","Szu-Wei Lee","Xian Zhang","Zhen Cai","Yuan Gao","Ping-Chieh Chou","Abdol\u00a0Hossein Rezaeian","Fei Han","Chi-Yun Wang","Juo-Chin Yao","Zhaohui Gong","Chia-Hsin Chan","Chih-Yang Huang","Fuu-Jen Tsai","Chang-Hai Tsai","Shih-Hsin Tu","Chih-Hsiung Wu","Dos\u00a0D.
