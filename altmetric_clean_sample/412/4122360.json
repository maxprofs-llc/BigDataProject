We reported that clenbuterol (CB) induced masseter muscle hypertrophy and slow-to-fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform transition through direct muscle \u03b22-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Thus, we hypothesized that CB would antagonize glucocorticoid (dexamethasone; DEX)-induced muscle atrophy and fast-to-slow MHC isoform transition.\nWe examined the effect of CB on DEX-induced masseter muscle atrophy by measuring masseter muscle weight, fiber diameter, cross-sectional area, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition. To elucidate the mechanisms involved, we used immunoblotting to study the effects of CB on muscle hypertrophic signaling (insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1) expression, Akt\/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and calcineurin pathway) and atrophic signaling (Akt\/Forkhead box-O (FOXO) pathway and myostatin expression) in masseter muscle of rats treated with DEX and\/or CB.\nMasseter muscle weight in the DEX-treated group was significantly lower than that in the Control group, as expected, but co-treatment with CB suppressed the DEX-induced masseter muscle atrophy, concomitantly with inhibition of fast-to-slow MHC isoforms transition. Activation of the Akt\/mTOR pathway in masseter muscle of the DEX-treated group was significantly inhibited compared to that of the Control group, and CB suppressed this inhibition. DEX also suppressed expression of IGF1 (positive regulator of muscle growth), and CB attenuated this inhibition. Myostatin protein expression was unchanged. CB had no effect on activation of the Akt\/FOXO pathway. These results indicate that CB antagonizes DEX-induced muscle atrophy and fast-to-slow MHC isoform transition via modulation of Akt\/mTOR activity and IGF1 expression. CB might be a useful pharmacological agent for treatment of glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Umeki, Daisuke","Ohnuki, Yoshiki","Mototani, Yasumasa","Shiozawa, Kouichi","Suita, Kenji","Fujita, Takayuki","Nakamura, Yoshiki","Saeki, Yasutake","Okumura, Satoshi"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0128263","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T09:35:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1433911148,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26053620"],"pmid":"26053620","pubdate":"2015-06-09T22:00:31+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Protective Effects of Clenbuterol against Dexamethasone-Induced Masseter Muscle Atrophy and Myosin Heavy Chain Transition.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protective-effects-clenbuterol-against-dexamethasoneinduced-masseter-muscle-atrophy-myosin-heavy-cha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5214547,"mean":6.1508528861404,"rank":2763286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1772361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5214547,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176648,"mean":8.6964275645781,"rank":98917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176648,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91511,"mean":9.4708795760026,"rank":51935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":29693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91511,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6289,"mean":8.4577388676845,"rank":3795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6289,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
