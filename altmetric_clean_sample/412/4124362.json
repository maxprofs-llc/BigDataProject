The use of various clinical governance levers can facilitate change in health care systems. The purpose of this paper is to define clinical governance levers, and to illustrate their use in a large-scale transformation. Design\/methodology\/approach - The empirical analysis deals with the in-depth study of a specific case, which is the organizational model for Ontario's cancer sector. The authors used a qualitative research strategy and drew the data from three sources: semi-structured interviews, analysis of documents, and non-participative observations. Findings - From the results, the authors identified three phases and several steps in the reform of cancer services in this province. The authors conclude that a combination of clinical governance levers was used to transform the system. These levers operated at different levels of the system to meet the targeted objectives. Practical implications - To exercise clinical governance, managers need to acquire new competencies. Mobilizing clinical governance levers requires in-depth understanding of the role and scope of clinical governance levers. Originality\/value - This study provides a better understanding of clinical governance levers. Clinical governance levers are used to implement an organizational environment that is conducive to developing clinical practice, as well as to act directly on practices to improve quality of care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e51","authors":["Brault, Isabelle","Denis, Jean-Louis","Sullivan, Terrence James"," Isabelle Brault "],"doi":"10.1108\/jhom-02-2015-0025","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T15:15:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-7266"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Health Organization and Management","last_mentioned_on":1462373395,"links":["http:\/\/www.emeraldinsight.com\/doi\/full\/10.1108\/JHOM-02-2015-0025","http:\/\/www.emeraldinsight.com\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1108\/JHOM-02-2015-0025","http:\/\/www.emeraldinsight.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1108\/JHOM-02-2015-0025","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26045191"],"pmid":"26045191","pubdate":"2015-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Commerce, Management, Tourism And Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Using clinical governance levers to support change in a cancer care reform.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-clinical-governance-levers-support-change-cancer-care-reform"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":3738019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3718374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":219204,"mean":8.2274883646667,"rank":108132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":101890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":219204,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":2.4068554913295,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.6875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
