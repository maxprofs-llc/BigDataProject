This uses novel biosensors that can precisely extract disease-related information from complex biological systems. Moreover, with the recent progress in chemical biology, materials science, and synthetic biology, it has become possible to simultaneously conduct diagnosis and targeted therapy (theranostics\/theragnosis) by directly connecting the readout of a biosensor to a therapeutic output. These advances pave the way for more advanced and better personalized treatment for intractable diseases with fewer side effects. In this review, we describe recent advances in the development of cutting-edge theranostic agents that contain both diagnostic and therapeutic functions in a single integrated system. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each modality, we discuss the future challenges and prospects of developing ideal theranostic agents for the next generation of personalized medicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Kojima, Ryosuke","Aubel, Dominique","Fussenegger, Martin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2015.05.021","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T12:00:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0402"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1470249612,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26056952?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cbpa.2015.05.021"],"pmid":"26056952","pubdate":"2015-06-10T22:02:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Novel theranostic agents for next-generation personalized medicine: small molecules, nanoparticles, and engineered mammalian cells.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-theranostic-agents-nextgeneration-personalized-medicine-small-molecules-nanoparticles-engineer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8394942,"mean":7.0701406373119,"rank":821751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7565730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8394942,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223457,"mean":8.477858164471,"rank":29800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":193290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223457,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":2.938873015873,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.7057272727273,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
