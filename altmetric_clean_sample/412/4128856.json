To understand the molecular basis of DNA recognition by the C\/EBP family we determined the x-ray structure of a C\/EBPalpha bZIP polypeptide bound to its cognate DNA site (A(-5)T(-4)T(-3)G(-2)C(-1)G(1)C(2)A(3)A(4)T(5)) and characterized several basic region mutants. Binding specificity is provided by interactions of basic region residues Arg(289), Asn(292), Ala(295), Val(296), Ser(299), and Arg(300) with DNA bases. A striking feature of the C\/EBPalpha protein-DNA interface that distinguishes it from known bZIP-DNA complexes is the central role of Arg(289), which is hydrogen-bonded to base A(3), phosphate, Asn(292) (invariant in bZIPs), and Asn(293). The conformation of Arg(289) is also restricted by Tyr(285). In accordance with the structural model, mutation of Arg(289) or a pair of its interacting partners (Tyr(285) and Asn(293)) abolished C\/EBPalpha binding activity. Val(296) (Ala in most other bZIPs) contributes to C\/EBPalpha specificity by discriminating against purines at position -3 and imposing steric restraints on the invariant Arg(300). Mutating Val(296) to Ala strongly enhanced C\/EBPalpha binding to cAMP response element (CRE) sites while retaining affinity for C\/EBP sites. Thus, Arg(289) is essential for formation of the complementary protein-DNA interface, whereas Val(296) functions primarily to restrict interactions with related sequences such as CRE sites rather than specifying binding to C\/EBP sites. Our studies also help to explain the phenotypes of mice carrying targeted mutations in the C\/EBPalpha bZIP region.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Miller, Maria","Shuman, Jon D","Sebastian, Thomas","Dauter, Zbigniew","Johnson, Peter F"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m300417200","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T08:38:27+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"17","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1391895261,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12578822"],"pmid":"12578822","pubdate":"2003-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structural basis for DNA recognition by the basic region leucine zipper transcription factor CCAAT\/enhancer-binding protein alpha.","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-basis-dna-recognition-basic-region-leucine-zipper-transcription-factor-ccaatenhancerbindi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4005713,"mean":5.0327643594151,"rank":919192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2531920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4005713,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114080,"mean":6.9412758865562,"rank":32069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114080,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29115,"mean":2.5176097426913,"rank":1908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":11945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29115,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":426,"mean":2.4333726415094,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":426,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
