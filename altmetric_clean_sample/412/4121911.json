In case of epiphysial necrosis, an endoprosthesis as well as an osteosynthesis will be carried out. Selective arteriography of the medial circumflex artery represents the most reliable study to establish, immediately after the fracture, the possible presence of a post-traumatic ischemic necrosis. Angiography, as a reliable diagnostic tool, has to be carried out in the most selective way and needs the image subtraction technique. The authors report their preliminary results on the reliability of angiography in the femoral epiphyseal ischemic necrosis diagnosed by comparing the results of angiography with the Wood light test carried out on the surgically removed femoral head.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086de","authors":["Mannella, P","Galeotti, R","Borrelli, M","Benea, G","Traina, G C","Massari, L","Chiarelli, G M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T08:17:33+00:00","issns":["0033-8362"],"issue":"6","journal":"La Radiologia Medica","last_mentioned_on":1341290335,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3715086"],"pmid":"3715086","pubdate":"1986-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"[Selective arteriography in fractures of the femur head].","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-arteriography-fractures-femur-head"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4006952,"mean":5.0321310180817,"rank":919260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2532113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4006952,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115099,"mean":6.9379497762526,"rank":32391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":79896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115099,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":1.3635306122449,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Medial circumflex femoral artery","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=500436415#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[4121911],"posted_on":"2012-07-03T04:38:55+00:00","summary":"The medial circumflex femoral artery (internal circumflex artery, medial femoral circumflex artery) is an artery in the upper thigh that helps supply blood to the neck of the femur.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=4485476","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Rytyho usa","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Rytyho usa"}}]}}
