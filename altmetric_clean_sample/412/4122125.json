Although significant disparities in the risks of metabolic syndrome by occupation type and sex are well documented, the factors associated with metabolic syndrome in low- to middle-income countries remain unclear. These gaps in evidence identify the need for\u00a0patterns of metabolic syndrome among hospital personnel of both sexes in Nigeria. A total of 256 hospital workers comprising 32.8% men were studied. The mean age of the participants was 42.03\u00b19.4\u00a0years. Using International Diabetic Federation criteria, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 24.2%. Women were substantially and significantly more likely to be identified with metabolic syndrome compared with men (34.9% vs 2.4%, respectively; P=.0001). This study identified metabolic syndrome among health workers with over one third of women with metabolic syndrome compared with <10% of men. These results support the implementation of lifestyle modification programs for management of metabolic syndrome in the health care workplace.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f9f","authors":["Adeoye, Abiodun M","Adewoye, Ifeoluwa A","Dairo, David M","Adebiyi, Adewole","Lackland, Daniel T","Ogedegbe, Gbenga","Tayo, Bamidele O","Adeoye, Abiodun M.","Adewoye, Ifeoluwa A.","Dairo, David M.","Lackland, Daniel T.","Tayo, Bamidele O."],"doi":"10.1111\/jch.12595","endpage":"884","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T08:56:53+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1751-7176"],"issue":"11","journal":"Journal of Clinical Hypertension","last_mentioned_on":1434309893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26053898","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jch.12595\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jch.12595\/pdf","pmid":"26053898","pubdate":"2015-06-09T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"880","title":"Excess Metabolic Syndrome Risks Among Women Health Workers Compared With Men","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/excess-metabolic-syndrome-risks-among-women-health-workers-compared-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6380092,"mean":5.985707906047,"rank":1322910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5048875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6380092,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180729,"mean":8.7556974458856,"rank":51642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":128484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180729,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":4.289122923588,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.971875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
