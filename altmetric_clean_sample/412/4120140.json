The current study examined the relationship between three self-report measures of psychological distress and ratings obtained from the corresponding clinician-administered measures in women seeking assessment for mental health problems following IPV (N = 185). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the self-report Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the interview-based Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Depression symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the depressive disorders sections from the clinician-administered Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-IV (ADIS-IV). Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the self-report Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the clinician-administered GAD section from the ADIS-IV. Results indicated that psychological distress was prevalent in the sample, with 27% receiving a PTSD diagnosis, 40% diagnosed with a depressive disorder, and 55% meeting criteria for GAD. Although each self-report measure was significantly and positively correlated with its corresponding clinician-administered measure, rates of diagnostic concordance were mixed. The BDI-II showed a high degree of agreement with the ADIS-IV depression section, but the IES-R and the CAPS were discordant at classifying PTSD. The BAI had acceptable sensitivity but poor specificity in relation to the ADIS-IV GAD section. These findings suggest that multiple assessment modalities should be considered when rating symptoms and estimating the prevalence of diagnoses among survivors of IPV.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Meghan W.
