It has been reported that Piwil1 is overexpressed in various types of cancer, including endometrial cancer. However, the underlying mechanism of Piwil1 in endometrial cancer remains largely unclear. PTEN exerts an important tumor suppressor role in endometrial carcinogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate whether Piwil1 could regulate the expression of PTEN. Herein, we found that Piwil1 could promote the loss of PTEN expression and increase aberrant hypermethylation of PTEN gene promoter in Ishikawa cells. We also found that Piwil1 could regulate the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). Silencing DNMT1 gene could upregulate the PTEN gene expression and change the methylation status of PTEN gene promoter in Ishikawa cells. These results suggested that Piwil1 caused the loss of PTEN expression through DNMT1-mediated PTEN hypermethylation. Taken together, these data provide a novel regulatory mechanism of Piwil1 in endometrial cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Chen, Zheng","Che, Qi","Jiang, Fei-Zhou","Wang, Hui-Hui","Wang, Fang-Yuan","Liao, Yun","Wan, Xiao-Ping"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2015.06.028","first_seen_on":"2015-06-10T13:18:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1090-2104"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1433935720,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26056945?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26056945","pubdate":"2015-06-10T22:02:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Piwil1 causes epigenetic alteration of PTEN gene via upregulation of DNA methyltransferase in type I endometrial cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/piwil1-causes-epigenetic-alteration-pten-gene-via-upregulation-dna-methyltransferase-type-i-endometr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5214302,"mean":6.1509615961972,"rank":4341202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5214302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176837,"mean":8.6843883937661,"rank":144171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176837,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7071,"mean":2.5705796322489,"rank":6078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7071,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":1.4392,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
