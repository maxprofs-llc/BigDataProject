Various substituents were introduced into the carbazole moiety, and large substituent effects were confirmed by means of absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. Dibenzocarbazoles were also converted into the corresponding BODIPYs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Chihiro Maeda"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b01363","first_seen_on":"2015-06-09T02:07:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1434073148,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b01363","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b01363?utm_content=buffer38fae&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer&"],"pmid":"26053127","pubdate":"2015-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Carbazole-Based Boron Dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs): Facile Synthesis, Structures, and Fine-Tunable Optical Properties","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbazolebased-boron-dipyrromethenes-bodipys-facile-synthesis-structures-finetunable-optical-propert"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5222019,"mean":6.1569969054133,"rank":2405387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2685819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5222019,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176785,"mean":8.7000916938186,"rank":82456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":88176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176785,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3293,"mean":3.3136956257594,"rank":1555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3293,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":3.0634230769231,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
