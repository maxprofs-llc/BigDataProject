However, challenges across all scales abound. In particular, the modularization and standardization of the components in a biological system, so-called biological parts, remain the biggest obstacle in synthetic biology. In this perspective, we will discuss the main challenges and opportunities in the rapidly growing synthetic biology field and the important roles that chemical engineers can play in its advancement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e6","authors":["Luo Y","Lee JK","Zhao H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ces.2012.06.013","first_seen_on":"2012-06-26T16:06:35+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0009-2509","00092509"],"journal":"Chemical Engineering Science","last_mentioned_on":1384613317,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0009250912003624"],"pmcid":"PMC3821781","pmid":"24222925","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Challenges and opportunities in synthetic biology for chemical engineers ","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/challenges-opportunities-synthetic-biology-chemical-engineers-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7353748,"mean":6.389009438314,"rank":3557627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3610018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7353748,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91234,"mean":5.4514518430831,"rank":39767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":48653,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91234,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":2.055972899729,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.0053333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
