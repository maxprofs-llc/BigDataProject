Contracting pelvic floor muscles (PF) during low abdominal hollowing may facilitate contraction of TrA. Thickness increase in the abdominal muscles during low abdominal hollowing has been measured with real-time ultrasound scanning and may indicate muscle contraction. The present study investigated the effect of instructing PF contraction on TrA thickness increase during low abdominal hollowing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003326","authors":["Critchley, Duncan"],"first_seen_on":"2012-06-30T13:53:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1358-2267"],"issue":"2","journal":"Physiotherapy Research International","last_mentioned_on":1340134404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12109236"],"pmid":"12109236","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley \\& Sons","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Instructing pelvic floor contraction facilitates transversus abdominis thickness increase during low-abdominal hollowing.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/instructing-pelvic-floor-contraction-facilitates-transversus-abdominis-thickness-increase-during-low"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635033,"mean":4.9228440290343,"rank":2900970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635033,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72200,"mean":4.7044845496474,"rank":52789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72200,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":2.3804587155963,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
