Integrated SPECT-CT is a dual-modality technique, which improves the sensitivity and specificity of existing radionuclide studies and enables characterization of equivocal findings detected by conventional imaging. There is a wide range of established and emerging clinical applications for SPECT-CT, which were reviewed in detail at a symposium organized by the British Institute of Radiology in March 2012. A series of articles were commissioned as an adjunct to the symposium and to raise awareness of the clinical utility of this technique. The focus of this article is on less commonly used and emerging clinical applications of hybrid SPECT-CT in a spectrum of benign and malignant conditions. The article will illustrate the incremental value of the technique in a variety of clinical applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008324","authors":["Yap KS","Patel CN","Chowdhury FU","Scarsbrook AF"],"doi":"10.1097\/mnm.0b013e328355b6b8","first_seen_on":"2012-06-30T13:16:23+00:00","issns":["1473-5628","0143-3636"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nuclear Medicine Communications","last_mentioned_on":1434122767,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22743585?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/Abstract\/2012\/08000\/Less_commonly_used_and_emerging_clinical.3.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/MNM.0b013e328355b6b8"],"pmid":"22743585","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Less commonly used and emerging clinical applications of SPECT-CT in benign and malignant disease.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/less-commonly-used-emerging-clinical-applications-spectct-benign-malignant-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":5908983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1958853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94079,"mean":5.8466623865304,"rank":58383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":31706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94079,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1257,"mean":1.6020222929936,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1257,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":1.1191489361702,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/219056749628489729","license":"public","citation_ids":[817199],"posted_on":"2012-06-30T13:16:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24808},"tweet_id":"219056749628489729"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NMC_Journal\/status\/609381171739230209","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[817199],"posted_on":"2015-06-12T15:26:07+00:00","author":{"name":"NuclearMedicineComms","url":"http:\/\/www.nuclearmedicinecomm.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2463248861\/NMC_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"A monthly rapid communications journal journal publishing research in all areas of nuclear medicine.
