Alternatively, it was thought that people might possess abstract rules (such as logical ones) but that these are induced developmentally through self-discovery methods and cannot be trained. Research suggests a much more optimistic view: even brief formal training in inferential rules may enhance their use for reasoning about everyday life events. Previous theorists may have been mistaken about trainability, in part because they misidentified the kind of rules that people use naturally.","ads_id":"1987Sci...238..625N","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["RE Nisbett","GT Fong","DR Lehman","PW Cheng"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.3672116","first_seen_on":"2012-07-01T19:51:18+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"issue":"4827","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1445113915,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/238\/4827\/625.full.pdf","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/238\/4827\/625","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.3672116","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3672116"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/238\/4827\/625.full.pdf","pmid":"3672116","pubdate":"1987-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Teaching reasoning.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.3672116","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/teaching-reasoning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6664670,"mean":6.1604842944166,"rank":896883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":5713017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6664670,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88893,"mean":5.3868780317689,"rank":12221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":76142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88893,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35164,"mean":30.79007559082,"rank":15290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":19462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35164,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":734,"mean":25.125798090041,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":734,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
