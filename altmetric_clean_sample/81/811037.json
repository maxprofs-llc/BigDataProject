However, sequencing in bulk is error prone. Thus, the generated data require error identification and correction. Most error-correction methods to date are not optimized for amplicon analysis and assume that the error rate is randomly distributed. Recent quality assessment of amplicon sequences obtained using 454-sequencing showed that the error rate is strongly linked to the presence and size of homopolymers, position in the sequence and length of the amplicon. All these parameters are strongly sequence specific and should be incorporated into the calibration of error-correction algorithms designed for amplicon sequencing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Pavel Skums","Zoya Dimitrova","David S Campo","Gilberto Vaughan","Livia Rossi","Joseph C Forbi","Jonny Yokosawa","Alex Zelikovsky","Yury Khudyakov","Skums P","Dimitrova Z","Campo DS","Vaughan G","Rossi L","Forbi JC","Yokosawa J","Zelikovsky A","Khudyakov Y"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-13-s10-s6","first_seen_on":"2012-06-27T04:32:32+00:00","issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"Suppl 10","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1340771508,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/13\/S10\/S6\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcbioinformatics\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-13-S10-S6.pdf","pmid":"22759430","pubdate":"2012-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"S6","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Efficient error correction for next-generation sequencing of viral amplicons","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-13-S10-S6","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-error-correction-nextgeneration-sequencing-viral-amplicons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715210,"mean":5.6976580270372,"rank":3344173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":765900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715210,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76131,"mean":5.2775965847891,"rank":49684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":12901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76131,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2752,"mean":4.8030374409306,"rank":2357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2752,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":4.6079268292683,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
