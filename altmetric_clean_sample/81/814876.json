The procedure allows blood flow to bypass proximal lesions of the intracranial vasculature. The performance of this bypass requires specialized microvascular training and the use of microvascular techniques. The techniques involved in performing these procedures include microdissection of the superficial temporal artery in the scalp, microdissection of the recipient middle cerebral artery branches near the sylvian fissure, and anastomosis techniques using either microvascular sutures or a microanastomotic device. The successful completion of the bypass and subsequent patency requires meticulous attention to technical details.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000354d","authors":["David W.
