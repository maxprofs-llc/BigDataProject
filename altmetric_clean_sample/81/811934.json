It is used to promote clinical competency and reflective-thinking skills. Simulation as a remediation allows students to practice skills, increase confidence, and minimize the likelihood of error prior to working in a clinical setting. The safety of patients depends on the accuracy of those providing care, and simulation as a learning method provides an opportunity to attain a level of experience with no human risk. This article provides an overview of simulation learning and its benefits.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e1","authors":["Ward-Smith P"],"first_seen_on":"2012-06-27T15:59:49+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Urologic Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1340812774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19241788"],"pmid":"19241788","pubdate":"2009-02-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"The effect of simulation learning as a quality initiative.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-simulation-learning-quality-initiative-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":1810069,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1641381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72329,"mean":4.7023478044464,"rank":28329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":39594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72329,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.0071428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=434575363242145&id=346596192040063","citation_ids":[811934],"posted_on":"2012-06-27T15:59:33+00:00","summary":"The effect of simulation learning as a quality initiative. http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19241788","author":{"name":"MySmartHealthcare","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/346596192040063","facebook_wall_name":"mySmartHealthcare","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/346596192040063\/picture","id_on_source":"346596192040063"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tactilevr\/statuses\/218010694866571265","license":"public","citation_ids":[811934],"posted_on":"2012-06-27T15:59:34+00:00","author":{"name":"mySmartHealthcare\u2122","url":"http:\/\/www.mysmarthealthcare.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2042217018\/mSH_Icon_blue_whtbg_normal.png","description":"Interactive training & education for HCPs.
