In this article, we mainly discuss several issues related to volunteer recruitment that had posed serious challenges to the visual prosthesis trials, such as low rates of participants, high expectations and underlying motivations to participate in the visual prosthesis trials as well as the importance of informed consent. When recruiting volunteers for visual prosthesis implants, it is critical that the visual prosthesis researchers should not only take into account the patient's expectations and motivations, but also make the patients fully aware of the possible benefits and risks involved with their participation, and help patients establish realistic expectations for the early phase of visual prosthesis implantation. Based on these considerations to the challenges, eligible volunteers may be recruited in the preliminary stages of visual prosthesis trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034de","doi":"10.1007\/s11948-012-9375-6","first_seen_on":"2012-06-26T19:29:28+00:00","issns":["1471-5546"],"journal":"Science & Engineering Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1340738960,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22729653?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22729653","pubdate":"2012-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Business, Management and Accounting","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Ethical Considerations for Volunteer Recruitment of Visual Prosthesis Trials.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethical-considerations-volunteer-recruitment-visual-prosthesis-trials"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75243,"mean":5.0918556125568,"rank":48317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75243,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":5.699085106383,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.3333333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
