However, educators may be hesitant to adopt this teaching strategy because of the lack of available research. The author discusses a study to determine whether a newly developed instrument, the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument, accurately measures the 3 subscales of accountability, preference for lecture or team-based learning, and student satisfaction. Results suggest the instrument is valid and reliable and may be a valuable tool in assessing the effectiveness of team-based learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b84","doi":"10.1097\/nne.0b013e31825a87cc","first_seen_on":"2012-06-30T04:47:39+00:00","issns":["0363-3624"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nurse Educator","last_mentioned_on":1342249566,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nurseeducatoronline\/Abstract\/2012\/07000\/Development_and_Psychometric_Testing_of_the.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nurseeducatoronline\/2012\/07000\/Development_and_Psychometric_Testing_of_the.16.pdf","pmid":"22688878","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"168","subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Development and Psychometric Testing of the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-psychometric-testing-teambased-learning-student-assessment-instrument-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2911244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1444027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75103,"mean":5.1212734414529,"rank":45044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75103,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":527,"mean":1.1197718631179,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":527,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.425,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
