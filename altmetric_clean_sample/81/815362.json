The present research aimed to examine the effect of exposure to images of idealized beauty in the media on adolescent girls' and boys' body image. The participants (595 adolescents) viewed television commercials containing either images of the thin ideal for women, images of the muscular ideal for men, or non-appearance television commercials. Body dissatisfaction was measured before and after commercial viewing. It was found that exposure to idealized commercials led to increased body dissatisfaction for girls but not for boys. Idealized commercials led to increased negative mood and appearance comparison for girls and boys, although the effect on appearance comparison was stronger for girls. Further, participants high on appearance investment reported greater appearance comparison after viewing idealized commercials than those less strongly invested in their appearance. The results suggest the immediate impact of the media on body image is both stronger and more normative for girls than for boys, but that some boys may also be affected.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f610006120","authors":["Hargreaves DA","Tiggemann M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bodyim.2004.10.002","endpage":"361","first_seen_on":"2012-06-29T07:47:14+00:00","issns":["17401445","1740-1445"],"issue":"4","journal":"Body Image","last_mentioned_on":1469261991,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1740144504000695"],"pmid":"18089166","pubdate":"2007-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"351","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Idealized media images and adolescent body image: \u201ccomparing\u201d boys and girls ","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/idealized-media-images-adolescent-body-image-comparing-boys-girls"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":738604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7345640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93560,"mean":5.8285423743307,"rank":8618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":84836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93560,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":11.142906403941,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.2916666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
