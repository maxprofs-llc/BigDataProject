The treatment of mitochondrial diseases is still inadequate. Therapies that have been attempted include: respiratory chain cofactors, other metabolites secondarily decreased in mitochondrial disorders, antioxidants, and agents acting on lactic acidosis. However, their role in the treatment of the majority of mitochondrial diseases is still unclear. Furthermore, some drugs may potentially have detrimental effects on mitochondrial dysfunction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c7","authors":["Mancuso M","Orsucci D","Filosto M","Simoncini C","Siciliano G"],"doi":"10.1517\/14656566.2012.657177","first_seen_on":"2012-06-30T13:56:16+00:00","issns":["1465-6566"],"issue":"","journal":"Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1335375068,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22292617"],"pmid":"22292617","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Drugs and mitochondrial diseases: 40 queries and answers.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drugs-mitochondrial-diseases-40-queries-answers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72191,"mean":4.708289347555,"rank":52827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":723,"mean":1.7833739612188,"rank":470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":723,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1197368421053,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
