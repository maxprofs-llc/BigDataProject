In patients with symptomatic CD, low BMD appears to be directly related to the intestinal malabsorption. Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) will reverse the histological changes in the intestine and also the biochemical evidence of calcium malabsorption, resulting in rapid increase of BMD. Nevertheless, GFD improves BMD but does not normalize it in all patients, even after the recovery of intestinal mucosa. Other mechanisms of bone injury than calcium and vitamin D malabsorption are thought to be involved, such as proinflammatory cytokines, parathyroid function abnormalities, and misbalanced bone remodeling factors, most of all represented by the receptor activator of nuclear factor B\/receptor activator of nuclear factor B-ligand\/osteoprotegerin system. By means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), it is now rapid and easy to obtain semiquantitative values of BMD. However, the question is still open about who and when submit to DXA evaluation in CD, in order to estimate risk of fractures. Furthermore, additional information on the role of nutritional supplements and alternative therapies is needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003caf","doi":"10.1155\/2012\/198025","first_seen_on":"2012-06-28T11:25:20+00:00","issns":["1687-630X"],"journal":"Gastroenterology Research & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1340882709,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22737164?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22737164","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Bone mineralization in celiac disease.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-mineralization-celiac-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72373,"mean":4.6743761952135,"rank":52896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72373,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":2.091724137931,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3.35,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
