In fact, the discovery of pathological TDP-43 solidified the idea that these disorders are multi-system diseases and this led to the concept of a TDP-43 proteinopathy as a spectrum of disorders comprised of different clinical and pathological entities extending from ALS to ALS with cognitive impairment\/dementia and FTLD-TDP without or with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). These align along a broad disease continuum sharing similar pathogenetic mechanisms linked to pathological TDP-43. We here review salient findings in the development of a concept of TDP-43 proteinopathy as a novel group of neurodegenerative diseases similar in concept to alpha-synucleinopathies and tauopathies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319d","authors":["Geser, Felix","Lee, Virginia M.\u2010Y.","Trojanowski, John Q."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1440-1789.2009.01091.x","endpage":"112","first_seen_on":"2012-06-30T00:45:31+00:00","issns":["1440-1789","0919-6544","14401789"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neuropathology","last_mentioned_on":1341017116,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1440-1789.2009.01091.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1440-1789.2009.01091.x\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC3131978","pmid":"20102519","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Asia","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"103","subjects":["pathology","neurology"],"title":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration: A spectrum of TDP\u00e2\u0080\u009043 proteinopathies","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-frontotemporal-lobar-degeneration-spectrum-tdp43-proteinopathies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6653728,"mean":6.1593372598521,"rank":4921729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":976184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6653728,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88681,"mean":5.3809558637799,"rank":57015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88681,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":2.1290707070707,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
