The methanol extract of P. incarnata exhibited significant aphrodisiac behaviour in male mice at all doses, i.e. 75, 100 and 150 mg\/kg. Amongst these, the highest activity was observed with the 100 mg\/kg dose when the mountings were calculated about 95 min after the administration of the test extracts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["Dhawan, Kamaldeep","Kumar, Suresh","Sharma, Anupam"],"doi":"10.1002\/ptr.1124","first_seen_on":"2012-07-03T01:01:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0951-418X","1099-1573"],"issue":"4","journal":"Phytotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1341277281,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12722149","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/ptr.1124"],"pmid":"12722149","pubdate":"2003-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Aphrodisiac activity of methanol extract of leaves of Passiflora incarnata Linn. in mice","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aphrodisiac-activity-methanol-extract-leaves-passiflora-incarnata-linn-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4809146,"mean":5.7500569465082,"rank":2553319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1602831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4809146,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76610,"mean":5.3034341134853,"rank":35989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":30165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76610,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1047,"mean":4.0697629063098,"rank":513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1047,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.85,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
