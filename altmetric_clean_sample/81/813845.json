Induction of cell survival involves a non-proteolytic mechanism and the proMMP-9 hemopexin domain (PEX9). To help design specific inhibitors of proMMP-9-cell binding, we have now characterized B-CLL cell interaction with the isolated PEX9. B-CLL cells bound soluble and immobilized GST-PEX9, but not GST, and binding was mediated by \u03b14\u03b21 integrin. The ability to recognize PEX9 was observed in all 20 primary samples studied irrespective of their clinical stage or prognostic marker phenotype. By preparing truncated forms of GST-PEX9 containing structural blades B1B2 or B3B4, we have identified B3B4 as the primary \u03b14\u03b21 integrin-interacting region within PEX9. Overlapping synthetic peptides spanning B3B4 were then tested in functional assays. Peptide P3 (FPGVPLDTHDVFQYREKAYFC), a sequence present in B4 or smaller versions of this sequence (peptides P3a\/P3b), inhibited B-CLL cell adhesion to GST-PEX9 or proMMP-9, with IC(50) values of 138 and 279 \u03bcm, respectively. Mutating the two aspartate residues to alanine rendered the peptides inactive. An anti-P3 antibody also inhibited adhesion to GST-PEX9 and proMMP-9. GST-PEX9, GST-B3B4, and P3\/P3a\/P3b peptides inhibited B-CLL cell transendothelial migration, whereas the mutated peptide did not. B-CLL cell incubation with GST-PEX9 induced intracellular survival signals, namely Lyn phosphorylation and Mcl-1 up-regulation, and this was also prevented by the P3 peptides. The P3 sequence may, therefore, constitute an excellent target to prevent proMMP-9 contribution to B-CLL pathogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Angeles Garcia-Pardo"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.354670","first_seen_on":"2012-06-28T12:01:18+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1340884869,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2012\/06\/22\/jbc.M112.354670.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2012\/06\/22\/jbc.M112.354670.full.pdf","pmid":"22730324","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A seventeen residue sequence from the MMP-9 hemopexin domain binds \u03b14\u03b21 integrin and inhibits MMP-9-induced functions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells*","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/17residue-sequence-matrix-metalloproteinase9-mmp9-hemopexin-domain-binds-%CE%B14%CE%B21-integrin-inhibits-mmp9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":942904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75295,"mean":5.0903320583313,"rank":48335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":14387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75295,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4820955121209,"rank":23086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":5410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.8527922077922,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
