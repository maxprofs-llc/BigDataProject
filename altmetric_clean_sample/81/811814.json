Genomic researchers in the USA, Canada and parts of Europe are encouraged to use informed consent to address the prospect of disclosing individual research results (IRRs) to study participants. In the USA, no national policy exists to direct this use of informed consent, and it is unclear how local institutional review boards (IRBs) may want researchers to respond.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e41","authors":["Christian Simon","Laura A Shinkunas","Debra Brandt","Janet K Williams"],"doi":"10.1136\/medethics-2011-100273","first_seen_on":"2012-06-27T14:45:49+00:00","issns":["1473-4257"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1360905743,"links":["http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/38\/7\/417.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/38\/7\/417.full.pdf","pmid":"22361295","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Institute of Medical Ethics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"417","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Individual genetic and genomic research results and the tradition of informed consent: exploring US review board guidance","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/individual-genetic-genomic-research-results-tradition-informed-consent-exploring-review-board-guidan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4013884,"mean":5.0326745274224,"rank":1585339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2407648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4013884,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73582,"mean":4.7637756486049,"rank":20565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":52489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73582,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1231,"mean":8.9474032520325,"rank":628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1231,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":7.3406428571429,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
