Look. Development of antibiotic resistance De novo by mutation.

The importance of phenotypic changes seen in a biofilm, which lead to genotypic alterations, cannot be overstated. Irrespective of if the biofilm is single microbe or polymicrobial, bacteria, protected within a biofilm from the external environment, communicate through signal transduction pathways (e.g., quorum sensing or two-component systems), leading to global changes in gene expression, enhancing virulence, and expediting the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Thus, one must examine a genetic change in virulence and resistance not only in the context of the biofilm but also as inextricably linked pathologies. Observationally, it is clear that increased virulence and the advent of antibiotic resistance often arise almost simultaneously; however, their genetic connection has been relatively ignored. Although the complexities of genetic regulation in a multispecies community may obscure a causative relationship, uncovering key genetic interactions between virulence and resistance in biofilm bacteria is essential to identifying new druggable targets, ultimately providing a drug discovery and development pathway to improve treatment options for chronic and recurring infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc1b","authors":["Meredith Schroeder","Benjamin Brooks","Amanda Brooks","Schroeder, Meredith","Brooks, Benjamin D","Brooks, Amanda E"],"doi":"10.3390\/genes8010039","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T10:24:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2073-4425"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genes","last_mentioned_on":1493993793,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/1\/39?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/1\/39?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/1\/39\/htm","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/1\/39","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28106797\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2073-4425\/8\/1\/39\/pdf","pmid":"28106797","pubdate":"2017-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","startpage":"39","title":"The Complex Relationship between Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complex-relationship-between-virulence-antibiotic-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":2.75,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":3227748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4906835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263902,"mean":12.758744999071,"rank":99357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":163355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263902,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":475,"mean":2.8823291139241,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":475,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":2.2638317757009,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
