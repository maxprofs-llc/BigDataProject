Least squares regression models were fitted with questionnaire-based siting time and other self-reported predictors to predict accelerometer-based sitting time.\nQuestionnaire-based and accelerometer-based average sitting times were \u2248272 and \u2248476\u2005min\/day, respectively. A low Pearson correlation (r=0.32), high mean bias (204.1\u2005min) and wide limits of agreement (549.8 to -139.7\u2005min) between questionnaire-based and accelerometer-based sitting time were found. The prediction model based on questionnaire-based sitting explained 10% of the variance in accelerometer-based sitting time. Inclusion of 9 self-reported predictors in the model increased the explained variance to 41%, with 10% optimism using a resampling bootstrap validation. Based on a split validation analysis, the developed prediction model on \u224875% of the workers (n=132) reduced the mean and the SD of the difference between questionnaire-based and accelerometer-based sitting time by 64% and 42%, respectively, in the remaining 25% of the workers.\nThis study indicates that questionnaire-based sitting time has low validity and that a prediction model can be one solution to materially improve the precision of questionnaire-based sitting time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Nidhi Gupta","Caroline Stordal Christiansen","Christiana Hanisch","Hans Bay","Hermann Burr","Andreas Holtermann"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-013251","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T09:43:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1485274846,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/1\/e013251?rss=1","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/7\/1\/e013251","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28093433\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/1\/e013251.full.pdf","pmid":"28093433","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e013251","title":"Is questionnaire-based sitting time inaccurate and can it be improved?
