The TNFS based nanotopography provides contact guidance cues for regulation of cellular alignment and enables cell sheet transfer, while magnetic nanoparticles facilitate the magnetic levitation of the cell sheet. The temperature-mediated change in surface wettability of the thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), PNIPAM, substratum enables the spontaneous detachment of cell monolayers, which can then be easily manipulated through use of a ring or disk shaped magnet. Our developed platform could be readily applicable to production of tissue-engineered constructs containing complex physiological structures for the study of tissue structure-function relationships, drug screening, and regenerative medicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Nisa Penland","Eunpyo Choi","Mikael Perla","Jungyul Park","Deok-Ho Kim","Nisa Penland","Eunpyo Choi","Mikael Perla","Jungyul Park","Deok-Ho Kim"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa55e0","first_seen_on":"2017-01-18T15:27:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","niams"],"issns":["1361-6528","0957-4484"],"issue":"7","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1484753229,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa55e0\/meta"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa55e0\/pdf","pmid":"28028248","pubdate":"2017-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"075103","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Facile fabrication of tissue-engineered constructs using nanopatterned cell sheets and magnetic levitation","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/facile-fabrication-tissueengineered-constructs-using-nanopatterned-cell-sheets-magnetic-levitation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.848,"score_history":{"1y":13.848,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.848},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":590666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7491956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258772,"mean":12.829206371656,"rank":31739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":227023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258772,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1580,"mean":6.0439417352755,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":1431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1580,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":4.2825671641791,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
