The development of low-cost, rapid and robust methods for drug-resistant TB detection is highly desirable for resource-limited settings.\nWe report the use of an in house plasmid-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction-high-resolution melting (qPCR-HRM) analysis for the detection of mutations related to rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in clinical isolates from Moroccan patients. Five recombinant plasmids containing predominant mutations (S531L, S531W, H526Y and D516V) and the wild-type sequence of the Rifampicin Resistance-Determining Region (RRDR) have been used as controls to screen 45 rifampicin-resistant and 22 rifampicin-susceptible MTB isolates.\nThe sensitivity and the specificity of the qPCR-HRM analysis were 88.8% and 100% respectively as compared to rifampicin Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST). The results of qPCR-HRM and DNA sequencing had a concordance of 100%.\nOur qPCR-HRM assay is a sensitive, accurate and cost-effective assay for the high-throughput screening of mutation-based drug resistance in TB reference laboratories.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bd","authors":["Bentaleb, El Mehdi","El Messaoudi, My Driss","Abid, Mohammed","Messaoudi, Malika","Yetisen, Ali K.","Sefrioui, Hassan","Amzazi, Saa\u00efd","Ait Benhassou, Hassan","El Mehdi Bentaleb","My Driss El Messaoudi","Mohammed Abid","Malika Messaoudi","Ali K.
