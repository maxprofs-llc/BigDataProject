Prior studies showed that overexpression of individual pre-miRs-182, -96 and -183 in prostate cells decreased zinc import, which is a characteristic feature of PCa tumours. Zinc is concentrated in healthy prostate 10-fold higher than any other tissue, and an >80% decrease in zinc is observed in PCa specimens. Here, we studied the effect of overexpression of the entire 4.8\u2009kb miR-183 family cluster, including the intergenic region which contains highly conserved genomic regions, in prostate cells. This resulted in overexpression of mature miR-183 family miRs at levels that mimic cancer-related changes. Overexpression of the miR-183 cluster reduced zinc transporter and intracellular zinc levels in benign prostate cells, PCa xenografts and fresh prostate epithelial organoids. Microarray analysis of miR-183 family cluster overexpression in prostate cells showed an enrichment for cancer-related pathways including adhesion, migration and wound healing. An active secondary transcription start site was identified within the intergenic region of the miR-183 cluster, which may regulate expression of miR-182. Taken together, this study shows that physiologically relevant expression of the miR-183 family regulates zinc levels and carcinogenic pathways in prostate cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shweta Dambal","Bethany Baumann","Tara McCray","LaTanya Williams","Zachary Richards","Ryan Deaton","Gail S.
