The purpose of this study was to understand the relationships between preoperative pain and perineural invasion in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nFifty-two chemotherapy naive patients undergoing resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2012 to 2014 completed a previously validated Brief Pain Inventory survey for preoperative clinical pain scoring. Preoperative pain was correlated with multiple clinicopathologic features.\nPreoperative pain was not associated with pathologic cancer stage, lymph node status, lymph node positivity ratio, resection margin status, or tumor location within the pancreas. In the subgroup of pancreatic head cancers, pain interference with affect was associated with the absence of perineural invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Patients with stage I cancer had higher pain interference scores than those with stage II cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).\nPreoperative pain does not predict the presence of perineural invasion or other pathologic prognostic factors in patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Higher pain scores in pancreatic head cancers correlated with absence of perineural invasion and early cancer stage. The effects of preoperative pain on quality and interference of daily life deserve further investigation in larger prospective studies involving patients with pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db8","authors":["Carr, Rosalie A.","Roch, Alexandra M.","Zhong, Xin","Ceppa, Eugene P.","Zyromski, Nicholas J.","Nakeeb, Attila","Schmidt, C.
