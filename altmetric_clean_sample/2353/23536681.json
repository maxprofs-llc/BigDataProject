Poxviruses must prevent activation of cellular apoptosis to ensure successful replication. These viruses devote a substantial portion of their genome to immune evasion. Many of these immune evasion products expressed during infection antagonize cellular apoptotic pathways. Poxvirus products target multiple points in both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, thereby mitigating apoptosis during infection. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that poxviruses also hijack cellular means of eliminating apoptotic bodies as a means to spread cell to cell through a process called apoptotic mimicry. Poxviruses are the causative agent of many human and veterinary diseases. Further, there is substantial interest in developing these viruses as vectors for a variety of uses including vaccine delivery and as oncolytic viruses to treat certain human cancers. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which poxviruses regulate the cellular apoptotic pathways remains a top research priority. In this review, we consider anti-apoptotic strategies of poxviruses focusing on three relevant poxvirus genera: Orthopoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, and Leporipoxvirus. All three genera express multiple products to inhibit both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with many of these products required for virulence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f610004704","authors":["Nichols, Daniel Brian","De Martini, William","Cottrell, Jessica","Daniel Nichols","William De Martini","Jessica Cottrell"],"doi":"10.3390\/v9080215","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T11:03:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1999-4915"],"issue":"8","journal":"Viruses (1999-4915)","last_mentioned_on":1502886761,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28786952?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/9\/8\/215?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/v9080215"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1999-4915\/9\/8\/215\/pdf","pmid":"28786952","pubdate":"2017-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","title":"Poxviruses Utilize Multiple Strategies to Inhibit Apoptosis","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poxviruses-utilize-multiple-strategies-inhibit-apoptosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386076,"mean":7.0651873001299,"rank":6064272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2021779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386076,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196866,"mean":12.538386742184,"rank":127787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":57399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196866,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1302,"mean":3.5727870868563,"rank":782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1302,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":2.6660631578947,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pox_papers\/statuses\/895239006203420672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23536681],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T11:03:06+00:00","author":{"name":"poxpapers","url":"http:\/\/virology.uvic.ca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/759061740298473472\/dfPvDVD__normal.jpg","description":"Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource","id_on_source":"pox_papers","tweeter_id":"759056794157064196","geo":{"lt":48.43294,"ln":-123.3693,"country":"CA"},"followers":14},"tweet_id":"895239006203420672"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VirusesMDPI\/statuses\/897798267601375232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23536681],"posted_on":"2017-08-16T12:32:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Viruses MDPI","url":"https:\/\/t.co\/S9n3oXM6i6","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/537227034850652160\/DGx3qo-__normal.png","description":"#Viruses2016 - At the Forefront of Virus-Host Interactions - \n26\u201328 January 2016, PharmaCenter, #UniversityOfBasel, Klingelbergstrasse 70, Basel, Switzerland","id_on_source":"VirusesMDPI","tweeter_id":"2890854922","followers":468},"tweet_id":"897798267601375232"}]}}
