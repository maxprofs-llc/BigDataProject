Bovine Lf (bLf, 100 mg\/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to rats before oral saline administration or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) following 60 min of RS load. In the case of oral saline administration, RS significantly raised plasma glucose, but bLf did not affect the level. Plasma glucose in OGTT showed an overall lower transition in the bLf group, and the levels at 30 and 180 min or the area under the curve (AUC) were significantly decreased. Although bLf suppressed an increase in plasma corticosterone during RS, the levels of plasma insulin, epinephrine and glucagon were not changed by the bLf treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f1f","authors":["Yuta MAEKAWA","Akihiko SUGIYAMA","Takashi TAKEUCHI"],"doi":"10.1292\/jvms.16-0498","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T10:56:16+00:00","issns":["0916-7250","1347-7439"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1502276164,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27941304?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27941304","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Lactoferrin ameliorates corticosterone-related acute stress and hyperglycemia in rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lactoferrin-ameliorates-corticosteronerelated-acute-stress-hyperglycemia-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":6335767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1131036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178761,"mean":12.37273347505,"rank":126397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178761,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":1.0898008877616,"rank":678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":3.1807692307692,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jvms_japan\/statuses\/895237237813649408","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23536556],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T10:56:04+00:00","author":{"name":"jvms_japan","url":"http:\/\/jsvetsci.jp\/jvms\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1898235853\/twitter-icon_normal.gif","id_on_source":"jvms_japan","tweeter_id":"524151017","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":36},"tweet_id":"895237237813649408"}]}}
