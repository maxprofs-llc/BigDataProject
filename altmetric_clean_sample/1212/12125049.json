Metabolomic analysis explores the integrated response of the organism to environmental changes. Metabolic profiling can identify biomarkers that are predictive of disease incidence and development, potentially providing insight into disease pathogenesis. This review provides an overview of the role of metabolomic analysis in diabetes research and summarizes recent research relating to the development of T1D and T2D in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ad","authors":["Frohnert, Brigitte I","Rewers, Marian J"],"doi":"10.1111\/pedi.12323","endpage":"14","first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T18:28:01+00:00","issns":["1399-5448"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1474482466,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pedi.12323\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pedi.12323\/pdf","pmid":"26420304","pubdate":"2015-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons A\/S","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Metabolomics in childhood diabetes","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolomics-childhood-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253738,"mean":12.663791177479,"rank":178474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253738,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":378,"mean":2.9179204244032,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":378,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.9611111111111,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
