Full optimization of the intercalated compound gave the following structural parameters of B(OH)4(4): B-O-B (105.3(\u25cb) - 115.3(\u25cb)) and B-O-H (111.5(\u25cb) - 115.4(\u25cb)) angles, B-O (1.476 \u00c5, 1.491 \u00c5) and O-H (0.98 \u00c5) distances. The calculated normal modes were assigned to experimental IR and Raman spectra. In general, close agreement between theory and experiment was obtained. The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is below 11 cm(-1). We also calculate the thermodynamical stability of Na8[AlSiO4]6(B(OH)4)2 with respect to Na8[AlSiO4]6(BH4)2 in the context of the tetrahydroborate hydration reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Alexander G.
