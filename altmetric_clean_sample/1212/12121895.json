The current study tested whether people with interpersonal problems formed more or less accurate metaperceptions about their personality (meta-accuracy), if they thought others saw them in more or less positive ways (positivity), and if they underestimated or overestimated how much others saw them as they saw themselves (transparency).\nParticipants (NTime1 = 189; NTime2 =175; Mage = 19.78; 36% male) completed a measure of interpersonal problems and provided personality judgments and metaperceptions for a group of peers after a first impression and after four months of acquaintanceship.\nGeneralized distress was associated with less positive metaperceptions at both times and with higher meta-accuracy after four months. Dominance problems were not associated with accuracy, positivity or transparency after a first impression, but dominance was linked to lower meta-accuracy and lower positivity after four months. Affiliation problems were associated with higher meta-accuracy after a first impression and with higher positivity and transparency at both times.\nMetaperceptions were linked to interpersonal problems, and these expectations might partially explain some maladaptive patterns of behavior.
