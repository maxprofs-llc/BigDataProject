Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to compare miR-127 expression between ESCC cell lines and normal esophageal epithelium cell line, as well as paired ESCC tumors and adjacent normal esophageal tissues in 33 patients. We found miR-127 was aberrantly downregulated in both ESCC cell lines and human ESCC tumors. In ESCC cell lines TE-1 and ECA109 cells, lentiviral-induced miR-127 upregulation markedly inhibited cancer proliferation and migration in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Through dual-luciferase assay and qRT-PCR, FMNL3 was confirmed to be the downstream target gene of miR-127 in ESCC. Finally, FMNL3 was downregulated by siRNA in TE-1 and ECA109 cells. And we discovered that SiRNA-induced FMNL3 downregulation had tumor suppressive effect in ESCC, inhibiting cancer proliferation, migration in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. These results suggest that miR-127 is downregulated and acting as tumor suppressor in ESCC. Inversely, FMNL3, the target gene of miR-127, is upregulated and acting as an oncogene in ESCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Gao, Xuhui","Wang, Xuelian","Cai, Kaican","Wang, Wujun","Ju, Qun","Yang, Xiyao","Wu, Hua","Wang, Haofei","Xuhui Gao","Xuelian Wang","Kaican Cai","Wujun Wang","Qun Ju","Xiyao Yang","Haofei Wang","Hua Wu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2016.09.025","first_seen_on":"2016-09-21T21:00:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0712","00142999"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1474491605,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27645894?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejphar.2016.09.025"],"pmid":"27645894","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"MicroRNA-127 is a tumor suppressor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma through the regulation of oncogene FMNL3","type":"article","volume":"791","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna127-tumor-suppressor-human-esophageal-squamous-cell-carcinoma-through-regulation-oncogene-fm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253737,"mean":12.663838722136,"rank":209590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253737,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2547,"mean":2.8810746268657,"rank":2028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2547,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.5035714285714,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
