As the total traffic load and the network variability-parameterized by the proportion of variable-cost links in the network-changes, the behaviors that the system presents can be understood with the introduction of a network of simpler structure. This is constructed from classes of nonoverlapping paths connecting source to destination nodes that are characterized by the number of variable-cost edges they contain. It is shown that localized peaks in the price of anarchy occur at critical traffic volumes at which it becomes beneficial to exploit ostensibly more expensive paths as the network becomes more congested. Simulation results verifying these findings are presented for the variation of the price of anarchy with the network's size, aspect ratio, variability, and traffic load.","authors":["A. Rose","R.
