[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-five healthy subjects with no orthopedic history of lower extremity were recruited. Gait training is performed using an underwater treadmill (HydroTrack(\u00ae) Underwater Treadmill System, Conray, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA), for twenty minutes per session, five sessions a week for four weeks. The water temperature was set at about 33\u2005\u00b0C and the depth was fixed to reach between the subjects' xiphoid process and the navel. [Results] After the intervention, step length, velocity, and cadence increased significantly. [Conclusion] This study conducted underwater treadmill training with normal people, with positive effects on gait ability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a8f","authors":["Myoung-Kwon Kim","Si-A Lee"],"doi":"10.1589\/jpts.29.67","first_seen_on":"2017-03-22T11:48:28+00:00","issns":["0915-5287","2187-5626"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Physical Therapy Science","last_mentioned_on":1490230292,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5300807\/?utm_content=bufferdf5bf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmcid":"PMC5300807","pmid":"28210041","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Physical Therapy Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"67","title":"Underwater treadmill training and gait ability in the normal adult","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jpts\/29\/1\/29_jpts-2016-846\/_article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/underwater-treadmill-training-gait-ability-normal-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":3382452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4994761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248240,"mean":13.356501218583,"rank":93648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":153410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248240,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":973,"mean":3.2680288065844,"rank":291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":973,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.1041666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Sports and Recreations":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ATUniversity\/statuses\/844514513814786048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18009345],"posted_on":"2017-03-22T11:42:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Aquatic Therapy U","url":"http:\/\/www.aquatic-therapy-university.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669748283\/atu_asymmetric_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Post-graduate studies in aquatic therapy.
