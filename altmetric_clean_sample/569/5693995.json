In order to avoid the bias generated by different assay methodologies, in this work we investigated the main properties of ten (commercial and recombinant) laccases from fungi and bacteria under identical conditions. As a general rule, the optimal activity was apparent at pH 3-4 and was lost at pH \u2265 7.0 (all laccases were stable at pH \u2265 7.0); enzymes active at neutral pH values were also identified. For all tested laccases, activity increased with temperature up to 80\u00b0C and stability was good at 25\u00b0C. Interestingly, laccases insensitive to high salt concentration were identified, this favoring their use in treating waste waters. Indeed, bacterial laccases retained a significant activity in the presence of DMSO (up to 40% final concentration) and of surfactants, suggesting that they can be applied in lignin degradation processes requiring solvents. The available laccases are versatile and satisfy requirements related to different processes. Notably, the recombinant laccase from Bacillus licheniformis favorably compares with the tested enzymes, indicating that it is well suited for different biotechnological applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031b5","authors":["Tonin, Fabio","Melis, Roberta","Cordes, Arno","Sanchez-Amat, Antonio","Pollegioni, Loredano","Rosini, Elena"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nbt.2016.01.007","first_seen_on":"2016-02-19T15:52:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1876-4347","18716784"],"issue":"3","journal":"New Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1460563172,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1871678416000108","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1871678416000108?sf23782921=1"],"pmid":"26844639","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Comparison of different microbial laccases as tools for industrial uses ","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-different-microbial-laccases-tools-industrial-uses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":1679509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5857155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285833,"mean":10.433691776988,"rank":81510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":203840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285833,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":2.3935660377358,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.946,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
