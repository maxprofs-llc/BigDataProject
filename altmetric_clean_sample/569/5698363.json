SPACE provides black-blood contrast, but has less crushing effect on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, a delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE) preparation suppresses the signal from slowly moving spins of a few mm per second. Therefore, we optimized a DANTE-preparation module for 7T. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal ratio for vessel wall, CSF, and lumen were calculated for SPACE and DANTE-SPACE in 11 volunteers at the middle cerebral artery (MCA). An exemplar MCA stenosis patient was scanned with DANTE-SPACE.\nThe 7T-optimized SPACE sequence improved the vessel wall point-spread function by 17%. The CNR between the wall and CSF was doubled (12.2 versus 5.6) for the DANTE-SPACE scans compared with the unprepared SPACE. This increase was significant in the right hemisphere (P\u2009=\u20090.016), but not in the left (P\u2009=\u20090.090). The CNR between wall and lumen was halved, but remained at a high value (24.9 versus 56.5).\nThe optimized SPACE sequence improves VWI at 7T. Additional DANTE preparation increases the contrast between the wall and CSF. Increased outer boundary contrast comes at the cost of reduced inner boundary contrast.
