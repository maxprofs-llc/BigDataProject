To the best of our knowledge, only six cases have been reported in the literature. Here we report an additional case, which was complicated by an intra-tumoral hematoma on clinical presentation and by papillary thyroid carcinoma-like histology on intra-operative frozen section diagnosis. An asymptomatic 78-year-old male presented with a two-year-history of a painless tumor of the left parotid. An intra-tumoral hematoma, which is unusual for a salivary gland tumor, was suspected from results of pre-operative radiology. The patient then underwent a left parotidectomy. The intra-operative frozen section diagnosis indicated a benign tumor, although ectopic papillary thyroid carcinoma was raised as a differential diagnosis since the eosinophilic tumor cells occasionally possessed nuclear grooves and nuclear pseudo-inclusions. By precise histopathological examination using paraffin sections, the tumor was finally diagnosed as striated duct adenoma. This type of tumor has unique features of hypervascular stroma and papillary thyroid carcinoma-like nuclei. In our case, the former feature was associated with the intra-tumoral hematoma and the latter feature, with difficulty in frozen section tumor diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f61000329e","authors":["Ito, Yohei","Fujii, Kana","Murase, Takayuki","Saida, Kosuke","Okumura, Yoshihide","Takino, Hisashi","Masaki, Ayako","Beppu, Shintaro","Kawakita, Daisuke","Ijichi, Kei","Inagaki, Hiroshi","Yohei Ito","Kana Fujii","Takayuki Murase","Kosuke Saida","Yoshihide Okumura","Hisashi Takino","Ayako Masaki","Shintaro Beppu","Daisuke Kawakita","Kei Ijichi","Hiroshi Inagaki"],"doi":"10.1111\/pin.12534","first_seen_on":"2017-04-26T00:51:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1320-5463","1440-1827","13205463"],"journal":"Pathology International","last_mentioned_on":1493167863,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pin.12534\/abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/pin.12534"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pin.12534\/pdf","pmid":"28440555","pubdate":"2017-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Striated duct adenoma presenting with intra-tumoral hematoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma-like histology","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":4263891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2251740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233903,"mean":12.66357099127,"rank":130168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233903,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":2.0024953560372,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.4,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pathowitter\/statuses\/857034251564462080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19573760],"posted_on":"2017-04-26T00:51:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Pathowitter","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788085326866706432\/1gzBh3hy_normal.jpg","description":"Pathology-related tweets (some emphasis on neuropath \/ hemetopath) | Mostly a relay account of GNU Social: https:\/\/quitter.se\/pathowitter","id_on_source":"pathowitter","tweeter_id":"788082462819774464","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":665},"tweet_id":"857034251564462080"}]}}
