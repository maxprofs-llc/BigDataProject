Fungi have a complex metabolism that differs from animals and plants. They secrete enzymes into their surroundings and absorb the breakdown products of enzyme action. Some of these enzymes are well-known allergens. The phylogenetic relationships among fungi were unclear until recently because classification was based on the sexual state morphology. Fungi lacking an obvious sexual stage were assigned to the artificial, now-obsolete category, \"Deuteromycetes\" or \"Fungi Imperfecti.\" During the last 20 years, DNA sequencing has resolved 8 fungal phyla, 3 of which contain most genera associated with important aeroallergens: Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Advances in fungal classification have required name changes for some familiar taxa. Because of regulatory constraints, many fungal allergen extracts retain obsolete names. A major benefit from this reorganization is that specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in individuals sensitized to fungi appear to closely match fungal phylogenetic relationships. This close relationship between molecular fungal systematics and IgE sensitization provides an opportunity to systematically look at cross-reactivity and permits representatives from each taxon to serve as a proxy for IgE to the group.","altmetric_jid":"5216117d3cf058827c000059","authors":["Levetin, Estelle","Horner, W Elliott","Scott, James A",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaip.2015.10.012","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T18:00:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2213-2198","2213-2201"],"journal":"The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice","last_mentioned_on":1451998384,"links":["http:\/\/www.jaci-inpractice.org\/article\/S2213-2198(15)00576-0\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.jaci-inpractice.org\/article\/S2213-2198(15)00576-0\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jaci-inpractice.org\/article\/S2213-2198(15)00576-0\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26725152?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jaci-inpractice.org\/article\/S2213219815005760\/pdf","pmid":"26725152","pubdate":"2016-01-05T12:53:21+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Taxonomy of Allergenic Fungi.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taxonomy-allergenic-fungi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908690,"mean":6.2029462469629,"rank":1544264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5334889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908690,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296874,"mean":8.8635787289513,"rank":80811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":214934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296874,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":545,"mean":8.6424705882353,"rank":174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":545,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":13.053125,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
