In five patients, utilization of the chimney graft technique was necessary. A mean of 2.5 (range 1-4) visceral vessels underwent chimney graft. The prophylactic use of EndoAnchors was utilized in all 9 patients. The decision to use the EndoAnchors was made in the preoperative planning phase.\nTechnical success was achieved in 100% of cases. In two cases, type 1a endoleaks were noted before the deployment of any EndoAnchors. In both cases, a final angiogram depicted resolution of the type 1a endoleak after insertion of the EndoAnchors. Mean follow-up time was 8 months. At 30 days, 3 months, and 6 months, 100% of the endografts remained patent and free from type 1a endoleaks. No adverse renal complications or mortality was reported.\nEndoAnchors are an applicable adjunct to EVAR as treatment for short infrarenal neck and pararenal AAAs. Further investigations are needed to determine the durability of this novel application. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e05","authors":["Gali\u00f1anes, Edgar Luis","Hernandez, Eduardo","Krajcer, Zvonimir"],"doi":"10.1002\/ccd.26351","first_seen_on":"2015-12-25T11:20:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-726X","15221946"],"issue":"4","journal":"Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (Formerly Catheterization and Cardiovascular Diagnosis)","last_mentioned_on":1451042408,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26699436?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ccd.26351\/abstract;jsessionid=D9243F242A867EA14368F146E03FD5BA.f02t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ccd.26351\/abstract;jsessionid=7D21F1756EDD40F74F048E8314CEBF81.f01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ccd.26351\/pdf","pmid":"26699436","pubdate":"2015-12-25T22:01:13+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Preliminary results of adjunctive use of endoanchors in the treatment of short neck and pararenal abdominal aortic aneurysms.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/ccd.26351","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preliminary-results-adjunctive-endoanchors-treatment-short-neck-pararenal-abdominal-aortic-aneurysms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8026935,"mean":6.8000500524819,"rank":6947458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8026935,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310989,"mean":9.1065673916678,"rank":259252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1189,"mean":2.0784814814815,"rank":686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1189,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.8625,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BCM_CVRI\/statuses\/680347289097900033","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4922929],"posted_on":"2015-12-25T11:20:08+00:00","author":{"name":"BCM_CVRI","url":"http:\/\/www.bcm.edu\/cvri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000515585721\/9f6ec1b7f20670f860e91837a1e3368e_normal.png","description":"The Official Twitter Account for the Baylor College of Medicine Cardiovascular Research Institute","id_on_source":"BCM_CVRI","tweeter_id":"1911846344","geo":{"lt":29.76328,"ln":-95.36327,"country":"US"},"followers":2256},"tweet_id":"680347289097900033"}]}}
