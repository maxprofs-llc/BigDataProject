Incidence was calculated for months before and after ART initiation and incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated.\n\u2003GUD incidence increased from 15.0 episodes per 100 person-years before ART to 26.9 episodes (IRR 1.83, p=0.03) in the first full quarter after ART initiation and HSV-2 GUD increased from 8.1 to 19.0 episodes (IRR 2.20, p=0.02). Subsequently, the incidence of GUD was similar to that before ART, although the numbers were small. Persons receiving suppressive acyclovir had fewer GUD episodes, but the IRR after beginning ART was similar to the placebo group.\n\u2003Initiation of ART in HIV-1\/HSV-2 co-infected persons is associated with a transient increase in GUD and HSV-2 GUD. Acyclovir reduces the incidence of GUD, but not the increase in GUD incidence in the quarter following initiation of ART.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Fife, Kenneth H","Mugwanya, Kenneth","Thomas, Katherine K","Baeten, Jared M","Celum, Connie","Bukusi, Elizabeth","de Bruyn, Guy","Mujugira, Andrew","Vwalika, Bellington","Wald, Anna","Lingappa, Jairam R",", ","Kenneth H.
