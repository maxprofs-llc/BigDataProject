The present study aimed to evaluate (1) associations of these physical performance measures with cause-specific mortality, (2) independent associations of individual physical performance measures with mortality, and (3) the added value of combined use of the 3 physical performance measures in predicting all-cause and cause-specific mortality.\nProspective cohort study with a follow-up of 10.5\u00a0years.\nTokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Study on Aging (TMIG-LISA), Japan.\nA total of 1085 initially nondisabled older Japanese aged 65 to 89\u00a0years.\nUsual walking speed, grip strength, and standing balance were measured at baseline survey.\nDuring follow-up, 324 deaths occurred (122 of cardiovascular disease, 75 of cancer, 115 of other causes, and 12 of unknown causes). All 3 physical performance measures were significantly associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and other-cause mortality, but not with cancer mortality, independent of potential confounders. When all 3 physical performance measures were simultaneously entered into the model, each was significantly independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The C statistics for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly increased by adding grip strength and standing balance to walking speed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), and the net reclassification improvement for them was estimated at 18.7% and 7.5%, respectively.\nSlow walking speed, weak grip strength, and poor standing balance predicted all-cause, cardiovascular, and other-cause mortality, but not cancer mortality, independent of covariates. Moreover, these 3 components of physical performance were independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and their combined use increased prognostic power.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a9","authors":["Nofuji, Yu","Shinkai, Shoji","Taniguchi, Yu","Amano, Hidenori","Nishi, Mariko","Murayama, Hiroshi","Fujiwara, Yoshinori","Suzuki, Takao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jamda.2015.11.003","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T22:54:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1525-8610","1538-9375"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of the American Medical Directors Association","last_mentioned_on":1452228988,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1525861015007033","http:\/\/www.jamda.com\/article\/S1525-8610(15)00703-3\/abstract?cc=y="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jamda.com\/article\/S1525861015007033\/pdf","pmid":"26717805","pubdate":"2016-01-01T22:02:09+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Associations of Walking Speed, Grip Strength, and Standing Balance With Total and Cause-Specific Mortality in a General Population of Japanese Elders","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-walking-speed-grip-strength-standing-balance-total-causespecific-mortality-general-popu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372787,"mean":6.4058744414895,"rank":439591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":6932894,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372787,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302209,"mean":9.0055992031976,"rank":25375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":276794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302209,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":910,"mean":5.7794235423542,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":910,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":6.1407843137255,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":10,"practitioner":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":10,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":13}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
