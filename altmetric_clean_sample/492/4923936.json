The decline in estrogen during menopause leads to bone resorption, increasing the risk of fractures. Transdermal estradiol has been shown to increase bone mineral density. Safety studies of transdermal estradiol have shown a decreased risk in cardiovascular disease as compared with oral estrogen therapy. Minivelle is currently the smallest available transdermal estradiol patch, providing the lowest effective dose of estrogen.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f63cf058f610005ede","authors":["Bertonazzi, Abigail","Nelson, Bridgette","Salvador, Jamie","Umland, Elena"],"doi":"10.2217\/whe.15.64","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T10:14:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1745-5065"],"journal":"Women's Health (08847355)","last_mentioned_on":1451116301,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26618621"],"pmid":"26618621","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The smallest available estradiol transdermal patch: a new treatment option for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smallest-available-estradiol-transdermal-patch-new-treatment-option-prevention-postmenopausal-osteop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882666,"mean":6.1770215490633,"rank":4884969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1751865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882666,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296136,"mean":8.8438549850573,"rank":183831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":94592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296136,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":3.0276049382716,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.66111111111111,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
