The relationship between mast cells and inflammatory phenotypes and treatment response of asthma is not clear.Clinical characteristics of subjects with stable asthma (n=55), inflammatory cell counts and gene expression microarrays in induced sputum were analysed. Sputum mast cell subtypes were determined by molecular phenotyping based on expression of mast cell biomarkers (tryptase (TPSAB1), chymase (CMA1) and carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3)). Effects of mast cell subtypes on steroid response were observed in a prospective cohort study (n=50).MCT (n=18) and MCT\/CPA3 (mRNA expression of TPSAB1 and CPA3; n=29) subtypes were identified, as well as a group without mast cell gene expression (n=8). The MCT\/CPA3 subtype had elevated exhaled nitric oxide fraction, sputum eosinophils, bronchial sensitivity and reactivity, and poorer asthma control. This was accompanied by upregulation of 13 genes. Multivariable logistic regression identified CPA3 (OR 1.21, p=0.004) rather than TPSAB1 (OR 0.92, p=0.502) as a determinant of eosinophilic asthma. The MCT\/CPA3 subtype had a better clinical response and reduced signature gene expression with corticosteroid treatment.Sputum mast cell subtypes of asthma can be defined by a molecular phenotyping approach. The MCT\/CPA3 subtype demonstrated increased bronchial sensitivity and reactivity, and signature gene expression, which was associated with airway eosinophilia and greater corticosteroid responsiveness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007384","authors":["Wang, Gang","Baines, Katherine J","Fu, Juan Juan","Wood, Lisa G","Simpson, Jodie L","McDonald, Vanessa M","Cowan, Douglas C","Taylor, D Robin","Cowan, Jan O","Gibson, Peter G","Gang Wang","Katherine J.
