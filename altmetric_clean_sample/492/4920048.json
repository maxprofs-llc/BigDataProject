Clinical cases showing acute periodontitis were treated using an oral tissue decontaminant material that contains a concentrated aqueous mixture of hydroxybenzenesulfonic and hydroxymethoxybenzene acids and sulfuric acid. The material was positioned into the pocket on the root surface and left in the site for 30 seconds. No instrumentation was performed before the treatment. No systemic or local antibiotics were used in any of the cases. A questionnaire was used for each patient to record the pain\/discomfort felt when the material was administered. All of the treated cases healed well and very rapidly. The infections were quickly resolved without complications, and the pockets associated with marginal tissue recession were also reduced. The momentary pain upon introduction of the material was generally well tolerated in the nonsurgically treated cases, and it completely disappeared after a few seconds. The biofilm decontamination approach seems to be a very promising technique for the treatment of acute periodontal abscess. The local application of this material avoids the use of systemic or local antibiotics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059af","authors":["Pini-Prato, Giovanpaolo","Magnani, Cristina","Rotundo, Roberto"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-24T11:30:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-3388"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Periodontics & Restorative Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1450956635,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26697553?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26697553","pubdate":"2015-12-24T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Treatment of Acute Periodontal Abscesses Using the Biofilm Decontamination Approach: A Case Report Study.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonsurgical-treatment-periimplantitis-using-biofilm-decontamination-approach-case-report-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6836868,"mean":6.1882509316009,"rank":5850175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6836868,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":295690,"mean":8.8218568766506,"rank":239857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":295690,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":1.7231092436975,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/679987529517383680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4920048],"posted_on":"2015-12-24T11:30:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
