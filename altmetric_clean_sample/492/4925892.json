CH group rats were put into automatic hypoxia box for 21 days. After that, RVSP, mRVP and RV\/( LV+S) were measured; Lung histopathological sections were prepared. The lumen area, ratio of wall thickness to radius of pulmonary veins were gauged by using the Image Pro Plus 6.0 software. Primary PVSMCs were cultured in hypoxia (4% O2) or normoxia (21% O2) for 60 hours respectively before extracted total protein for Western blotting analysis. PPAR\u03b3 protein expression in rat pulmonary vein smooth muscle and pulmonary vein smooth muscle cells was detected by Western blot.\nCompared with NC group [(27.06\u00b12.10), (12.58\u00b10.82)mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa)], the RVSP and mRVP in CH group [(50.46\u00b19.51), (21.66\u00b11.85)mmHg] were significantly increased (P<0.05). The RV\/(LV+S) of CH group was (0.56\u00b10.05), markedly higher than that of NC group (0.36\u00b10.04, P<0.05). The luminal area\/total area of vein in CH group decreased to (48.62\u00b113.61)% compared with that in NC group (66.16\u00b18.72)% (P<0.05). The wall thickness\/venous radius (WT%) of CH group increased from (7.23\u00b10.71)% (NC) to (16.43\u00b15.08)% (P<0.05). The level of PPAR\u03b3 protein in pulmonary vein smooth muscle of CH group was (52.95\u00b13.83)%, lower than that of NC (100\u00b10)% (P<0.05). PPAR\u03b3 protein in pulmonary vein smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro in hypoxia was (59.38\u00b117.12)%, lower than that cultured in normoxia (100\u00b10)% (P<0.05).\nHypoxia induced increase of RVSP, mRVP, RV\/(LV+S), and accompanied with pulmonary venous remodeling. The underlying mechanism of the vein change may related to down-regulated expression of PPAR\u03b3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd08","authors":["Zhang, Jie","Jiang, Qian","Chen, Xiuqing","Chen, Yuqin","Lu, Wenju","Wang, Jian"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T17:58:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-0939"],"issue":"8","journal":"Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases","last_mentioned_on":1458226688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26703344?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26703344","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"[Hypoxia induced the remodeling of pulmonary vein smooth muscle and reduced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 expression].","type":"article","volume":"38"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7406294,"mean":6.4383957944913,"rank":5343471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1803223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7406294,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302867,"mean":9.0197874637626,"rank":191038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":93543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302867,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124,"mean":0.58577235772358,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.54166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/680809814847426560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4925892],"posted_on":"2015-12-26T17:58:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"680809814847426560"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/statuses\/710480341815853056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4925892],"posted_on":"2016-03-17T14:58:08+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":443},"tweet_id":"710480341815853056"}]}}
