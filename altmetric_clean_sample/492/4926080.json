Technological improvements in recent years in radiation therapy, with intensity-modulated techniques, reinforce even more its role. However, both local and locoregional relapses are still observed. Understanding biological mechanisms of treatment resistance is a topic of major interest. From the cancer cell itself, its ability to repair and proliferate, its microenvironment and oxygenation conditions, migratory and invasive capacity, to biological parameters related to the patient, there are many mechanisms involving radiosensitivity and\/or radioresistance of head and neck cancer. The present study explores the main biological mechanisms involved in radiation resistance of head and neck cancer, and describes promising therapeutic approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d43","authors":["Guy, Jean-Baptiste","Rancoule, Chlo\u00e9","M\u00e9ry, Beno\u00eete","Espenel, Sophie","Wozny, Anne-Sophie","Simonet, St\u00e9phanie","Vallard, Alexis","Alphonse, Gersende","Ardail, Dominique","Rodriguez-Lafrasse, Claire","Magn\u00e9, Nicolas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bulcan.2015.10.016","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T20:33:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1769-6917"],"issue":"1","journal":"Bulletin du Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1451162012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26702507?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26702507","pubdate":"2015-12-26T22:01:09+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"[Radiosensitivity and\/or radioresistance of head and neck cancers: Biological angle].","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiosensitivity-andor-radioresistance-head-neck-cancers-biological-angle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882666,"mean":6.1770215490633,"rank":5895960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882666,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296135,"mean":8.8439150722306,"rank":240372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296135,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":1.498,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0023076923077,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/680848945321357313","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4926080],"posted_on":"2015-12-26T20:33:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"680848945321357313"}]}}
