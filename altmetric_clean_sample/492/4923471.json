The identification of a variety of bioactive molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and matrix molecules, sequestered within dentin and dental pulp provides the opportunity to present key signaling molecules promoting reparative and regenerative events after injury.\nThe protection of the biological activity of these molecules by mineral in dentin before their release allows a continuing supply of these molecules, while avoiding the short half-life and the non-human origin of exogenous molecules. The ready release of these bioactive molecules by the various tissue preparation agents, medicaments, and materials commonly used in endodontics highlights the opportunities for translational regenerative strategies exploiting these molecules with little change to existing clinical practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Smith, Anthony J","Duncan, Henry F","Diogenes, Anibal","Simon, Stephane","Cooper, Paul R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2015.10.019","first_seen_on":"2015-12-25T14:50:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-3554","0099-2399"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1452127005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26699924?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099-2399%2815%2900986-3\/abstract?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=0099-2399_201601_42_1_&amp%3Belsca4=Dentistry"],"pmid":"26699924","pubdate":"2015-12-25T22:00:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Exploiting the Bioactive Properties of the Dentin-Pulp Complex in Regenerative Endodontics","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploiting-bioactive-properties-dentinpulp-complex-regenerative-endodontics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6917999,"mean":6.2117021646992,"rank":4912395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1758350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6917999,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297111,"mean":8.8609026353874,"rank":184699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":94460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297111,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":816,"mean":1.3999779141104,"rank":275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":816,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.1625,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
