The association of chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension portends a worse prognosis. The pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension differs in the presence or absence of lung disease. We describe the physiological determinants of the normal pulmonary circulation to better understand the pathophysiological factors implicated in chronic parenchymal lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension. This review will focus on the pathophysiology of 3 forms of chronic lung disease-associated pulmonary hypertension: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sarcoidosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["Singh, Inderjit"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjmed.2015.11.026","first_seen_on":"2015-12-27T14:16:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1555-7162"],"journal":"American Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1451225793,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26706386?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26706386","pubdate":"2015-12-27T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension in chronic parenchymal lung disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pathophysiology-pulmonary-hypertension-chronic-parenchymal-lung-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6884314,"mean":6.1787773952151,"rank":5897473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6884314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297851,"mean":8.8714361255664,"rank":241819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297851,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3148,"mean":8.3550816650779,"rank":2753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3148,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.8667777777778,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
