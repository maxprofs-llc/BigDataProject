Metastatic or primary lung malignancies developed in 18 (5.3%) of the 339 patients in the first 2 years of the follow-up. In 11 (3.2%) patients these malignancies were detected on routine chest radiographs while in 7 (2.0%) patients these were detected on chest radiographs taken because of pulmonary complaints. The mean survival after detection of the pulmonary malignancy was 8 months. All patients died within 21 months, independent of pathology or therapy. No correlation was found between stage, location or differentiation of the primary tumour. As a result of this study it can be concluded that there is no benefit for the patient for a 6-month thoracic radiograph in routine follow-up for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. It gives false certainty and burdens the health care system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f54","authors":["Merkx, M A W","Boustahji, A H","Kaanders, J H A M","Joosten, F","Marres, H A M","Bruaset, I","de Wilde, P C M"],"doi":"10.1054\/ijom.2002.0289","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T11:41:12+00:00","issns":["0901-5027"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1353024000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1054\/ijom.2002.0289"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijoms.com\/article\/S0901502702902894\/pdf","pmid":"12361070","pubdate":"2002-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"A half-yearly chest radiograph for early detection of lung cancer following oral cancer","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/halfyearly-chest-radiograph-early-detection-lung-cancer-following-oral-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":1405358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":4194314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":67},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246552,"mean":9.4539920584383,"rank":71883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":170739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246552,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":1.7388791208791,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.5285714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Mundh\u00f6hlenkarzinom, Diagnostik und Therapie: Kurzfassung der Leitlinie \"Mundh\u00f6hlenkarzinom, Diagnostik und Therapie\"","url":"http:\/\/www.awmf.org\/uploads\/tx_szleitlinien\/007_100OLk_S3_Mundhoehlenkarzinom_112012.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[4048021,16023205,16023241,16023248,16023249,20533737,4925092,16023251,16023252,16023254,2560891,20533739,16023255,14728935,4925117,16023277,2560910,16023210,17912790,1983866,20533754,20533761,16023212,16023214,16023215,20533766,20533767,16023216,4925043,2560881,5757608,20533768,16023217,16023222,16023224,4925018,16023225,16023226,20533774,16023228,15781462,20533785,16023231,16023234,16023235,2560867,16023236,16023237,9692161,20533802,20533807,16023278,20533813,4925111,16023279,4925121,16023282,16023283,16023287,16023289,16023291,16023292,16023294,20533830,16023295,16023296,4492092,16023297,16023300,4216179,16023301,4925074,4925128,4925006],"posted_on":"2012-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany","description":"The Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) is an umbrella organization of over 150 societies, and advises the government of the Federal Republic of Germany as well as the governments of the German federal countries in all topics of scientific medicine and medical research and classification.","geo":{"country":"DE"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/www.awmf.org\/leitlinien\/detail\/ll\/007-100OL.html","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-073a1284beac8217f161fd9228f13ffda1d37566a5389b933b514689cd608fe8.jpg"}}]}}
