This study investigates the working alliance and competence\/adherence as predictors of outcome of CBT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD).\nEighty-two clinically referred patients (58.5% female; age: M\u00a0=\u00a033.6 years, SD\u00a0=\u00a010.3) with PD (n\u00a0=\u00a031) or SAD (n\u00a0=\u00a051) were treated with 12 sessions of manualized CBT by 22 clinicians with limited CBT experience in a randomized controlled effectiveness trial. Independent assessors rated the CBT competence\/adherence of the therapists using a revised version of the Cognitive Therapy Adherence and Competence Scale, and the patients rated the quality of the working alliance using the Working Alliance Inventory-short form in therapy sessions 3 and 8. The outcome was assessed by independent assessors as well as by patients self-report. A total of 20.7% of the patients (27.5% SAD, 9.7% PD) dropped out during treatment. The association between the alliance, competence\/adherence, outcome and dropout was investigated using multiple regression analyses.\nHigher therapist' competence\/adherence early in the therapy was associated with a better outcome among PD patients, lower competence\/adherence was associated with dropout among SAD patients. Higher rating of the alliance late in the therapy was associated with a better outcome, whereas lower alliance rating late in the therapy was associated with dropout.\nThe findings indicate that the therapist competence\/adherence and the working alliance have independent contributions to the outcome from CBT for anxiety disorders, but in different phases of the treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ab","authors":["Haug, Thomas","Nordgreen, Tine","\u00d6st, Lars-G\u00f6ran","Tangen, Tone","Kvale, Gerd","Hovland, Ole Johan","Heiervang, Einar R","Havik, Odd E","Thomas Haug","Tine Nordgreen","Lars-G\u00f6ran \u00d6st","Tone Tangen","Gerd Kvale","Ole Johan Hovland","Einar R.
