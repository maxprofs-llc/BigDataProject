The authors designed an experimental study using volume measures, histopathological analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance of fat graft. The effect of repeated subcutaneous injection of CO2 is not yet investigated\nApproximately 0.5 ml of human fat were transplanted in a group of female nude mice. The mice were treated with 3 injections of 80 \u00b5l each carbon dioxide (total 240 \u00b5l) for 7 weeks. Initially, in vivo measurements were conducted and subsequently a comprehensive histopathological analysis was performed.\nThe presence of inflammation was graded absent to minimal in animals treated with CO2 while a minimal to moderate grade was assigned to the control group.\nCO2 injection enhances the inflammatory response of the implanted tissue and reduces the reabsorption rate. The treatment may improve the graft survival in a more prolonged time-frame.","authors":["Nisi, G","Barberi, L","Ceccaccio, L","Cuomo, R","Sisti, A","Castagna, A","Zerini, I","Brandi, C","Grimaldi, L","D'Aniello, C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T11:53:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2284-0729"],"issue":"23","journal":"European review for medical and pharmacological sciences","last_mentioned_on":1451073123,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26698245?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26698245","pubdate":"2015-12-26T22:02:40+00:00","subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Effect of repeated subcutaneous injections of carbon dioxide (CO2) on inflammation linked to hypoxia in adipose tissue graft.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-repeated-subcutaneous-injections-carbon-dioxide-co2-inflammation-linked-hypoxia-adipose-tissu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/680476116390313985","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4925199],"posted_on":"2015-12-25T19:52:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":412},"tweet_id":"680476116390313985"}]}}
