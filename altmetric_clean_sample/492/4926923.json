The acceptable daily intake of SB is 5 mg\/kg-bw, however, it has been found to be used in the food commodities at relatively high levels (2119 mg\/kg). Earlier studies on SB have shown its immunosuppressive properties, but comprehensive immunotoxicity data is lacking. Our studies have shown that SB was non cytotoxic in splenocytes up to 1000 \u03bcg\/ml for 72 h, however at 2500 \u03bcg\/ml it was found to be cytotoxic. Thus, 1000 \u03bcg\/ml dose of SB was chosen for the subsequent experiments. SB significantly suppresses the proliferation of Con A and LPS stimulated splenocytes at 72 h, while allogenic response of T cells was significantly decreased after 96 h. SB did not affect the relative expression of CD3e or CD4 molecules following 72 h exposure, however, it downregulated the relative expression of CD8 co-receptor. Further, exposure of spleenocytes to SB for 72 h led to reduced expression of CD28 and CD95, which play a vital role in T cell activation. SB also suppresses the relative expression of CD19, CD40 and CD95 receptors on B cells after 72 h. In addition to the functional responses, SB lowered the expression of IL4, IL6, IFN\u03b3 and IL17 cytokines in Con A stimulated splenocytes; and IL6, IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 in LPS stimulated splenocytes following 48 h of exposure. Taken together, the present study is suggestive of the immunomodulatory potential of SB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Yadav, Ashish","Kumar, Arvind","Das, Mukul","Tripathi, Anurag"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2015.12.016","first_seen_on":"2015-12-27T11:20:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6351"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1451215233,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26706697?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26706697","pubdate":"2015-12-27T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Sodium benzoate, a food preservative, affects the functional and activation status of splenocytes at non cytotoxic dose.","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-benzoate-food-preservative-affects-functional-activation-status-splenocytes-non-cytotoxic-dos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6884314,"mean":6.1787773952151,"rank":5897461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6884314,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297851,"mean":8.8714181635049,"rank":241810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297851,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1677,"mean":7.5053890214797,"rank":1357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1677,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":10.566636363636,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
