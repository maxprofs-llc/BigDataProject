These impacts are empirically tested by survey data collected from 186 questionnaires of construction companies operating in Shanghai, China. The results, obtained by partial least squares analysis, show that organizational management commitment to safety and employee involvement is positively related to all three institutional pressures, while the perception of responsibility for safety and health is significantly influenced by coercive and mimetic pressure. However, coercive and normative pressures have no significant effect on the applicability of safety rules and work practices, revealing the importance of external organizational pressures in improving project safety climate from a systematic view. The findings also provide insights into the use of institutional forces to facilitate the improvement of safety climate in the construction industry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["He, Qinghua","Dong, Shuang","Rose, Timothy","Li, Heng","Yin, Qin","Cao, Dongping","Qinghua He","Shuang Dong","Timothy Rose","Heng Li","Qin Yin","Dongping Cao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2015.11.034","endpage":"239","first_seen_on":"2015-12-27T13:42:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-2057","00014575"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1451223692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26706434?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26706434","pubdate":"2015-12-27T22:00:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"230","title":"Systematic impact of institutional pressures on safety climate in the construction industry.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0001457515301494","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-impact-institutional-pressures-safety-climate-construction-industry-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6884314,"mean":6.1787773952151,"rank":5132288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":986849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6884314,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297851,"mean":8.8714364613058,"rank":202914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297851,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2026,"mean":4.6470054320988,"rank":1226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2026,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.7402,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
