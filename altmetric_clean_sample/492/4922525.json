Some studies have shown the benefits of topiramate monotherapy in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). However, there are no current systematic reviews to determine the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate monotherapy in people with JME.\nTo determine the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate monotherapy in the treatment of JME.\nWe searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (2 November 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies CRSO, 2 November 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid, 2 November 2015), EMBASE (1 July 2015) and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 November 2015). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies.\nWe included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating topiramate monotherapy versus placebo or other AED treatment for people with JME, with the outcomes of proportion of responders or experiencing adverse events (AEs).\nTwo review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta-analyses due to the limited available data.\nWe included three studies with 83 participants. For the efficacy, a greater proportion of participants in the topiramate group had a 50% or more reduction in primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) compared with participants in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between topiramate versus valproate in participants responding with a 50% or more reduction in myoclonic seizures or in PGTCS or seizure-free. Concerning tolerability, we ranked AEDs associated with topiramate as moderate-to-severe, while we ranked 59% of AEDs linked to valproate as severe complaints. Moreover, systemic toxicity scores were higher in the valproate group than the topiramate group. We judged the quality of the evidence from the studies to be very low.\nThis review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME. Based on the current limited available data, topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate, but there were no more benefits of efficacy in topiramate compared with valproate. In the future, well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to test the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Liu, Jia","Wang, Lu-Ning","Wang, Yu-Ping"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd010008.pub2","first_seen_on":"2015-12-25T09:51:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1469-493X","1465-1858"],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1484324401,"links":["http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/CD010008\/EPILEPSY_topiramate-monotherapy-juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20NewAndUpdatedSummaries%20(New%20and%20updated%20Cochrane%20summaries)","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD010008.pub2","http:\/\/www.cochrane.org\/hr\/CD010008\/topiramat-kao-jedini-lijek-monoterapija-za-lijecenje-djecje-mioklone-epilepsije"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD010008.pub2\/pdf","pmid":"26695884","pubdate":"2015-12-25T22:02:32+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicine"],"title":"Topiramate monotherapy for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/topiramate-monotherapy-juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":701989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7361239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":311293,"mean":9.1481089652158,"rank":35157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":275802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":311293,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8791,"mean":17.684321501706,"rank":2914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":5853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8791,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":26.97799,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
