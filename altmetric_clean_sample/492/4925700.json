UV thermal denaturation studies of duplexes containing butylene and heptylene IaCL revealed a 20oC reduction in stability compared to the unmodified duplexes. Circular dichroism profiles of these IaCL DNA duplexes exhibited signatures consistent with B-form DNA. Human O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT) was capable of repairing both IaCL containing duplexes with slightly greater efficiency towards the heptylene analog. Interestingly, repair efficiencies of hAGT towards these IaCL were lower compared to O6-alkylene linked IaCL lacking the 5'-3'-phosphodiester linkage between the connected 2'-deoxyguanosine residues. These results demonstrate that the proficiency of hAGT activity towards IaCL at the O6-atom of dG is influenced by the backbone phosphodiester linkage between the cross-linked residues.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["O'Flaherty, Derek Kyle","Wilds, Christopher James","O'Flaherty, Derek K.","Wilds, Christopher J."],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201501253","endpage":"583","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T15:19:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452768410,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201501253?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201501253"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201501253\/pdf","pmid":"26692563","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"576","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"O6\u2010Alkylguanine DNA Alkyltransferase Repair Activity Towards Intrastrand Cross\u2010Linked DNA is Influenced by the Internucleotide Linkage","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/o6alkylguanine-dna-alkyltransferase-repair-activity-towards-intrastrand-crosslinked-dna-influenced-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6975036,"mean":6.2337487846271,"rank":3178425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3739075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6975036,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":297854,"mean":8.8819709386843,"rank":135810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":158919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":297854,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2128,"mean":1.3386582040433,"rank":290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2128,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":1.237619047619,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
