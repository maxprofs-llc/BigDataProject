PCNA consists of three toroidal-shaped monomers that encircle double-stranded DNA. The diverse functions of PCNA may be regulated by interactions with partner proteins. Many of PCNA partner proteins generally have a conserved PCNA-interaction peptide (PIP) motif, located at the N- or C- terminal region. The PIP motif forms a 310 helix that entered into the hydrophobic groove produced by IDCL (interdomain-connecting loop), CL (central loop) and CT (C-terminal tail) in the PCNA. Post-translational modification of PCNA also plays a critical role in regulation of its function and binding partner proteins. Structural and biochemical studies of PCNA-protein will be useful in the designing therapeutic agents, as well as estimating the outcome of anticancer drug development. This review summarizes the characterization of eukaryotic PCNA in relation to the protein structures, functions, modifications and interaction proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa92d3cf058f61000de7c","authors":["Park, So Young","Jeong, Mi Suk","Han, Chang Woo","Yu, Hak Sun","Jang, Se Bok"],"doi":"10.4014\/jmb.1509.09051","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T11:19:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1738-8872"],"journal":"Journal of microbiology and biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1451089833,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26699741?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26699741","pubdate":"2015-12-26T22:02:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"Structural and functional insight into proliferating cell nuclear antigen.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-functional-insight-proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6882666,"mean":6.1770215490633,"rank":5895937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6882666,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296135,"mean":8.8438752254045,"rank":240349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296135,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":392,"mean":1.3442710997442,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":392,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.5540625,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
