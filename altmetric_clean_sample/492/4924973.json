From 6607 non-diabetic participants without statin treatment at baseline, 386 developed incident type 2 diabetes during a 5.9-year follow-up. A total of 3330 non-diabetic participants without statin treatment had both baseline and follow-up visit data, and were included in statistical analyses of the worsening of glycemia.\nCompared to single lipid and lipoprotein measurements, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein ratios were better predictors of the glucose area under the curve and incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors. The apolipoprotein B\/LDL cholesterol ratio was the strongest predictor of the worsening of glycemia, whereas the apolipoprotein A1\/HDL cholesterol ratio was the strongest predictor of incident type 2 diabetes. The associations of lipoprotein traits, apolipoproteins and their ratios with insulin sensitivity were stronger than those with insulin secretion.\nThe apolipoprotein B\/LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1\/HDL cholesterol ratios were the strongest predictors of the worsening of glycemia and incident type 2 diabetes, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002346","authors":["Fizelova, Maria","Miilunpohja, Manna","Kangas, Antti J","Soininen, Pasi","Kuusisto, Johanna","Ala-Korpela, Mika","Laakso, Markku","Stan\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1, Alena"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.atherosclerosis.2015.03.034","first_seen_on":"2015-12-26T11:34:37+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1879-1484"],"issue":"1","journal":"Atherosclerosis (00219150)","last_mentioned_on":1451081764,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25818853"],"pmid":"25818853","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Associations of multiple lipoprotein and apolipoprotein measures with worsening of glycemia and incident type 2 diabetes in 6607 non-diabetic Finnish men.","type":"article","volume":"240","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-multiple-lipoprotein-apolipoprotein-measures-worsening-glycemia-incident-type-2-diabete"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6865651,"mean":6.1811303570652,"rank":5114660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":986530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6865651,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296088,"mean":8.8436174435215,"rank":201498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":55785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296088,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1524,"mean":4.8037491792515,"rank":1048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1524,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":4.7227209302326,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
