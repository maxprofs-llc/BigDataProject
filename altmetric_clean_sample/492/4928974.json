The main outcome measures assessed were IOP, change in visual acuity, IOP-lowering medications, and the complications and reoperation rates.\nThe most common etiology observed was blunt trauma in 35 eyes (68.6%). Glaucomatous optic neuropathy was detected in 13 eyes (25.49%) preoperatively. The IOP reduced significantly from a preoperative mean of 26.3\u00b111.5 mm Hg to 13\u00b14.6 mm Hg (P<0.001) at the final visit. The mean preoperative number of IOP-lowering medications of 2.9\u00b10.8 reduced to 0.3\u00b10.7 at last follow-up (P<0.001). The best-corrected visual acuity (Snellens) improved significantly from 20\/600 to 20\/60 (P<0.001). Complete success defined as IOP\u226421 mm Hg without medications was achieved in 93%\u00b15% and 80%\u00b113% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Major postoperative complications included retinal detachment in one eye and SFIOL dislocation in another.\nThe technique of combining SFIOLs with trabeculectomy with adjunctive MMC in the management of subluxated\/dislocated lenses resulted in good IOP control and improvement in visual acuity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007ca9","authors":["David, Rathini L","Balekudaru, Shantha","George, Ronnie J","Sen, Parveen","Lingam, Vijaya","David, Rathini L.","George, Ronnie J."],"doi":"10.1097\/ijg.0000000000000344","endpage":"e690","first_seen_on":"2015-12-28T06:10:26+00:00","issns":["1536-481X","1057-0829"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Glaucoma","last_mentioned_on":1469661463,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/9000\/00000\/Management_of_Elevated_Intraocular_Pressure.99043.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Abstract\/2016\/07000\/Management_of_Elevated_Intraocular_Pressure.23.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/9000\/00000\/Management_of_Elevated_Intraocular_Pressure.99043.pdf","pmid":"26550973","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"e686","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Management of Elevated Intraocular Pressure Associated With Subluxated\/Dislocated Lenses by Combining Trabeculectomy With Adjunctive Mitomycin C With Lensectomy, Vitrectomy, and Scleral Fixation of Intraocular Lens.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/07000\/Management_of_Elevated_Intraocular_Pressure.23.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-elevated-intraocular-pressure-associated-subluxateddislocated-lenses-combining-trabeculec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":6185645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1090574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314113,"mean":9.277991136919,"rank":217019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":52299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314113,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1355,"mean":1.6286011816839,"rank":816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1355,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":3.6147826086957,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/statuses\/681356432302714881","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4928974],"posted_on":"2015-12-28T06:10:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":481},"tweet_id":"681356432302714881"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/statuses\/758441267512553472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4928974],"posted_on":"2016-07-27T23:17:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":481},"tweet_id":"758441267512553472"}]}}
