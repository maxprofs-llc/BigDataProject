It was hypothesized that subjects using LOW-CAD would cycle with greater torque and thus show greater musculoskeletal improvements compared to subjects using HIGH-CAD.\nRandomized pre-post design SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen men and three women (22-67 years) with C4-T6 motor complete chronic SCI were randomized to LOW-CAD (n=9) or HIGH-CAD (n=8).\nLOW-CAD cycled at 20 rpm and HIGH-CAD at 50 rpm three times\/week for six months. Cycling torque (resistance per pedal rotation) increased if targeted cycling cadence was maintained.\nDual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to assess distal femur aBMD, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess to assess trabecular and cortical bone architecture and thigh muscle volume, and biochemical markers to assess bone turnover.\n15 subjects completed the study. LOW-CAD obtained maximal average torque of 2.9\u00b12.8 Nm and HIGH-CAD of 0.8\u00b10.2 Nm. LOW-CAD showed greater decreases in bone-specific-alkaline-phosphatase (BALP) indicating less bone formation for HIGH-CAD (15.5% decrease for LOW-CAD, 10.7% increase for HIGH-CAD). N-telopeptide (N-Tx) decreased 34% within LOW-CAD indicating decreased resorption. Both groups increased muscle volume (LOW-CAD by 19%; HIGH-CAD by 10%). LOW-CAD showed a non-significant 6-7% improvement in distal femur trabecular bone number (p=0.08) and separation (p=0.08) while HIGH-CAD showed a non-significant decline of 2-3%.\nThis study suggests that the greater torque achieved with LOW-CAD cycling may result in improved bone health due to decreased bone turnover and improved trabecular bone. Longer term outcome studies are warranted to identify the effect on fracture risk.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005737","authors":["Johnston, Therese E","Marino, Ralph J","Oleson, Christina V","Schmidt-Read, Mary","Leiby, Benjamin E","Sendecki, Jocelyn","Singh, Harshvardhan","Modlesky, Christopher M","Therese E.
