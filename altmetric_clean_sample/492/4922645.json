After 60 days, rats were administrated with TZS for 0.1 g x kg(-1), and the volume is 0.02 mL x g(-1). After 3 days, the medicated serum was prepared and detected by UPLC, and then we predicted the possible chemical structure of the absorbed components of TZS. According to the absorbed components, the potential targets of TZS were found by ligand profiling of Discovery Studio 3.5. All of these target genes were submitted to DAVID onine for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The 5 absorbed components of TZS have been predicted, and four of them have been identified as parishin B, parishin C, parishin, pennogenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosy-(1-->2)-beta-D-glucoside. Through reverse finding targets, we got 861 pharmacophore models and 9 pathways from KEGG, BIOCARTA after document verification. These results showed that the efficacy mechanism of TZS on VD perhaps were be related with these absorbed components and pathways. If the traditional herbs could be proved effective by efficacy tests, the serum pharmacochemistry, computer-aided drug design, system biology and other technologies can be used in the next experiments, which will be beneficial to fast discovery of material basis and mechanisms of traditional medicine coming form ethnic minorities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc89","authors":["Zhou, Wen-bin","Lin, Li","Li, Zhi-yong","Bi, Tian","Ye, Tian-yuan","Ma, Cui-qiang","Bao Hong-juan, ","Wang, Hong-ping","Zhang, Bai-xia","Song, Kuo-kui","Li, Yan-wen","Wang, Yun"],"first_seen_on":"2015-12-25T11:03:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1001-5302"],"issue":"13","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi China journal of Chinese materia medica","last_mentioned_on":1451087253,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26697697?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26697697","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies","pharmacology"],"title":"Study on active ingredient and mechanism in preventing vascular dementia of Tianzhusan coming from Tujia medicine.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-active-ingredient-mechanism-preventing-vascular-dementia-tianzhusan-coming-tujia-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6865651,"mean":6.1811303570652,"rank":2935114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3776052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6865651,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296127,"mean":8.8363941497874,"rank":124209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":162179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296127,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":0.76143844492441,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.52272727272727,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
