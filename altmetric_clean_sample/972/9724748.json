In this study, we compared 10 P. multocida isolates from Icelandic sheep with respiratory symptoms and 19 isolates from apparently healthy abattoir sheep. We examined capsule type, genetic variability and the presence of the toxA gene in the two groups. Surprisingly, we found that all ovine P. multocida isolates examined in this study carried the toxA gene, which markedly differs from what has been published from other studies. Interestingly, all isolates from abattoir animals were capsule type D, while bacteria isolated from animals with clinical respiratory symptoms had capsule types A, D or F. Examination of 7 housekeeping genes indicated that the clinical respiratory isolates were significantly more heterogeneous than the abattoir isolates (p < 0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). The results suggest that there may be at least two groups of P. multocida in sheep - a genetically homogeneous group that resides in the respiratory tract, and a genetically heterogeneous group that is the predominant cause of disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Thorbjorg Einarsdottir","Thorbjorg Einarsdottir","Eggert Gunnarsson","Olof G Sigurdardottir","Einar Jorundsson","Vala Fridriksdottir","Gudridur E Thorarinsdottir","Sigridur Hjartardottir"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.000306","first_seen_on":"2016-07-15T09:14:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5644","0022-2615"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1468403609,"links":["http:\/\/jmm.microbiologyresearch.org\/content\/journal\/jmm\/10.1099\/jmm.0.000306"],"pmid":"27381564","pubdate":"2016-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Variability of Pasteurella multocida isolated from Icelandic sheep and detection of the toxA gene","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variability-pasteurella-multocida-isolated-icelandic-sheep-detection-toxa-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":6990018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259295,"mean":11.746335464762,"rank":218517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259295,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":968,"mean":2.8229741468459,"rank":784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":968,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.7738461538462,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Microbiology Society Journals | Variability of Pasteurella multocida isolated from Icelandic...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=569097023262944&id=482629961909651","license":"public","citation_ids":[9724748],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T09:53:29+00:00","summary":"N\u00fdjar ranns\u00f3knarni\u00f0urst\u00f6\u00f0ur \u00e1 lungnapest \u00ed sau\u00f0f\u00e9 voru birtar n\u00fdlega \u00ed Journal of Medical Microbiology.
