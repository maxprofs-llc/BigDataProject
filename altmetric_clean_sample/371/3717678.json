In contrast to self-resolving infection in C57Bl\/6 WT mice, Slpi(-\/-) mice launch a strong Th1 response to L. major, yet fail to control infection and develop destructive, nonhealing lesions with systemic spread of parasites. Because SLPI is both produced by murine macrophages and antagonizes their function, we examined the contribution of macrophage polarization to the defective host response in the absence of SLPI. Slpi(-\/-) and Slpi(+\/+) macrophages were first primed with either IFN\u03b3 or IL-4 to generate classically activated M1 or alternatively activated M2 macrophages. After infection with L. major, Slpi(-\/-) M1 macrophages expressed elevated iNOS RNA, whereas arginase was more highly expressed in WT than Slpi(-\/-) M2 macrophages. After in vivo infection, we found that both IFN\u03b3 and iNOS were persistently overexpressed in chronic lesions in Slpi(-\/-) mice, but surprisingly, IL-4 and arginase concomitantly remained elevated. Moreover, overexpression of the negative regulators SOCS1 and IL-27 provided insight into the failure of IFN\u03b3 to clear L. major from the dermal lesions. Notably, adenoviral delivery of SLPI to L. major-infected Slpi(-\/-) mice significantly limited the progression of infection. These studies suggest that convergence of M1 and M2 macrophage responses may influence the outcome of innate host defense against intracellular parasites and that SLPI is critical for coordinating resistance to chronic leishmaniasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["McCartney-Francis N","Jin W","Belkaid Y","McGrady G","Wahl SM"],"doi":"10.1189\/jlb.4a0612-295rr","first_seen_on":"2015-02-20T13:15:47+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Leukocyte Biology","last_mentioned_on":1424438136,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25030421?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25030421","pubdate":"2014-07-18T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Aberrant host defense against Leishmania major in the absence of SLPI.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aberrant-host-defense-against-leishmania-major-absence-slpi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785233,"mean":5.7270898405796,"rank":4006243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785233,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150072,"mean":9.8191102611433,"rank":123784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150072,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":4.1653123486683,"rank":683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":6.1603,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
