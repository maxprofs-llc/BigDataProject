Early (or interim) (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computerized tomography (FDG-PET\/CT), as a test of tumor sensitivity to ongoing\/planned therapy, has been shown to be prognostic for survival in HL. Based on results of interim FDG-PET\/CT, therapy may be subsequently modified through minimization or via intensification for low- and high-risk patient populations, respectively (ie, response-adapted therapy). Important data have been generated to standardize the interpretability and reproducibility of interim FDG-PET\/CT (eg, the Deauville 5-point system), and observational and noncontrolled prospective studies have produced evidence supporting the hypothesis that response-adapted therapy may potentially serve as a predictive tool. Furthermore, results from noninferiority phase 3 clinical trials randomizing early-stage HL patients with negative interim FDG-PET\/CT to combined modality therapy versus chemotherapy alone have been reported. The current collective findings from these randomized early-stage HL studies have shown that acute relapse rates are lower with combined modality therapy, even in patients with negative interim FDG-PET\/CT. Additional randomized response-adapted studies are ongoing and novel FDG-PET\/CT applications involving quantitative techniques and innovative imaging modalities are being investigated to identify more robust imaging biomarkers. Treatment of early-stage HL remains a clinical management choice for physicians and patients to make with consideration of acute and long-term outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d6","authors":["Andrew M Evens","Lale Kostakoglu"],"doi":"10.1182\/asheducation-2014.1.135","first_seen_on":"2015-02-20T12:04:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4383"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hematology","last_mentioned_on":1424433888,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25696846?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"25696846","pubdate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"The role of FDG-PET in defining prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma for early-stage disease.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-fdgpet-defining-prognosis-hodgkin-lymphoma-earlystage-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785233,"mean":5.7270898405796,"rank":3389871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":778982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785233,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150074,"mean":9.8190303785493,"rank":107686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":26290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150074,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":405,"mean":2.2533712871287,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":405,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.1769230769231,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
