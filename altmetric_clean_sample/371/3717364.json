Romaine seedlings were grown with or without AM fungi. Soil surrounding plants was inoculated with ca. 8 log CFU\/plant of either Salmonella enterica or E. coli EHEC composites. Samples (soil, root, and shoot) were analyzed on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 for Salmonella and EHEC by direct plating and selective enrichment. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, populations of Salmonella and EHEC, respectively, were 4.20 and 3.24 log CFU\/root, 2.52 and 1.17 log CFU\/shoot, and 5.46 and 5.17 log CFU\/g soil. By selective enrichment, samples tested positive for Salmonella or EHEC at day 22 at rates of 94 and 68% (shoot), 97 and 56% (root), and 100 and 75% (soil), respectively, suggesting that Salmonella has a greater propensity for survival than EHEC. Salmonella populations in soil remained as high as 4.35 log CFU\/g by day 22, while EHEC populations dropped to 1.12 log CFU\/g in the same amount of time. Ninety-two percent of all Romaine leaves in our study were positive for internalized Salmonella from days 8 to 22 and remained as high as 1.26 log CFU\/shoot on day 22 in AM fungi+Romaine plants. There were no differences (P>0.05) between the survival of either pathogen based on the presence or absence of mycorrhizal fungi. Results of this study suggest that AM fungi do not affect the internalization and\/or survival of either S. enterica or E. coli O157:H7 in Romaine lettuce seedlings. Our results should provide Romaine lettuce farmers confidence that the presence and\/or application of AM fungi to crop soil is not a contributing factor to the internalization and survival of Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 within Romaine lettuce plants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Nicholson AM","Gurtler JB","Bailey RB","Niemira BA","Douds DD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.10.001","first_seen_on":"2015-02-20T11:49:11+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1424431630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25440552?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25440552","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Influence of mycorrhizal fungi on fate of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella in soil and internalization into Romaine lettuce plants.","type":"article","volume":"192","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-mycorrhizal-fungi-fate-e-coli-o157-h7-salmonella-soil-internalization-romaine-lettuce-plan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785528,"mean":5.72647012043,"rank":4006244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785528,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150077,"mean":9.818362669581,"rank":123784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150077,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1017,"mean":2.388937007874,"rank":708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1017,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":0.94189189189189,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
