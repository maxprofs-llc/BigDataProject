Detailed ophthalmic examination was performed in 242 sporadic and arRCD subjects. Genomic DNA was investigated using our customized next generation sequencing panel targeting up to 123 genes implicated in inherited retinal disorders. Stringent filtering coupled with Sanger sequencing and followed by cosegregation analysis was performed to confirm biallelism and the implication of the most likely disease causing variants. Sequencing identified 9 RP1 mutations in 7 index cases. Eight of the mutations were novel, and all cosegregated with severe arRCD phenotype, found associated with additional macular changes. Among the identified mutations, 4 belong to a region, previously associated with arRCD, and 5 others in a region previously associated with adRCD. Our prevalence studies showed that RP1 mutations account for up to 2.5% of arRCD. These results point out for the necessity of sequencing RP1 when genetically investigating sporadic and arRCD. It further highlights the interest of unbiased sequencing technique, which allows investigating the implication of the same gene in different modes of inheritance. Finally, it reports that different regions of RP1 can also lead to arRCD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Said El Shamieh","Elise Boulanger-Scemama","Marie-Elise Lancelot","Aline Antonio","Vanessa D\u00e9montant","Christel Condroyer","M\u00e9lanie Letexier","Jean-Paul Saraiva","Saddek Mohand-Sa\u00efd","Jos\u00e9-Alain Sahel","Isabelle Audo","Christina Zeitz"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/485624","first_seen_on":"2015-02-19T12:45:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2314-6141"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1424344270,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25692139?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25692139","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Targeted Next Generation Sequencing Identifies Novel Mutations in RP1 as a Relatively Common Cause of Autosomal Recessive Rod-Cone Dystrophy.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-next-generation-sequencing-identifies-novel-mutations-rp1-relatively-common-cause-autosomal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4782626,"mean":5.7258040009438,"rank":4004486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4782626,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151346,"mean":9.7782303478809,"rank":124894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151346,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3092,"mean":2.0683183435781,"rank":2093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3092,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.2708955223881,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
