Up to date, different studies have shown that a number of transcription factors are activated by hypoxia which in turn activate a broad array of mitogenic, pro-invasive, pro-angiogenic, and pro-metastatic genes. On the other hand, macrophages respond to hypoxia by up-regulating several genes which are chief factors in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this review article we focus mainly on the role of macrophages during inflammation and discuss their response to hypoxia by regulating a diverse array of transcription factors. We also review the existing literatures on hypoxia and its cellular and molecular mechanism which mediates macrophages activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f04","authors":["Fattah Sotoodehnejadnematalahi","Bernard Burke"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-19T22:31:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-3866"],"issue":"11","journal":"Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1424358158,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25691922?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25691922","pubdate":"2014-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Human activated macrophages and hypoxia: a comprehensive review of the literature.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-activated-macrophages-hypoxia-comprehensive-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4782626,"mean":5.7258040009438,"rank":4004500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4782626,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151347,"mean":9.77820835701,"rank":124897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151347,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.5853719008264,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.4,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/status\/568425433424793601","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3715678],"posted_on":"2015-02-19T15:02:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":415},"tweet_id":"568425433424793601"}]}}
