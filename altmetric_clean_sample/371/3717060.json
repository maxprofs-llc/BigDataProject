The coupling of heteroatom-substituted alkenes was achieved by means of catalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), enabling the construction of functionalized quaternary centers with unusual ease. Challenging thermodynamically controlled hydrogenations and isomerizations of alkenes as well as reductions of vinyl halides were accomplished using HAT processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Simonneau, Antoine","Oestreich, Martin"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201500557","endpage":"3558","first_seen_on":"2015-02-20T10:35:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"12","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
