Treatment of tea leaves with SHAM reduced the performance of TG and TG-elicited level of the lipoxygenase gene CsiLOX1 and the putative allene oxide synthase gene CsiAOS1. The release of wound-induced green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and the expression of the hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) gene CsiHPL1 were also reduced by SHAM treatment. The negative effect of SHAM dramatically reduced the total hebivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and the attractiveness to the parasitoid wasp Apanteles sp. These results indicated that SHAM may negatively mediate tea defense response against TG by modulating the wound-induced emission of GLVs, the expression of genes involved in oxylipin pathway, and the emission of other HIPV compounds that mediate direct and indirect defenses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ed2","authors":["Xin Z","Zhang Z","Chen Z","Sun X"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10265-014-0642-2","first_seen_on":"2015-02-20T14:03:45+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Plant Research","last_mentioned_on":1424441016,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24888389?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24888389","pubdate":"2014-06-04T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) negatively mediates tea herbivore-induced direct and indirect defense against the tea geometrid Ectropis obliqua.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salicylhydroxamic-acid-sham-negatively-mediates-tea-herbivoreinduced-direct-indirect-defense-against"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785233,"mean":5.7270898405796,"rank":2540343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1593450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785233,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150074,"mean":9.8190353761172,"rank":83109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":49519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150074,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":2.6318043478261,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.0805555555556,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
