Sixty Australian carers were assessed regarding their quality of life, psychological distress, social isolation and caregiving experience. Their scores were compared with two matched community samples and previous studies. Carers were ten times more likely to be socially isolated and quality of life was significantly less than matched community samples. Over 40\u00a0% of the carer sample met criteria for probable psychiatric disorder. Comparison of caregiving experiences with a study 15\u00a0years ago showed no improvement in negative caregiving experiences. Carers still face considerable challenges to their wellbeing as they support people living with mental illness, in spite of progress in the development of policy and services.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b1","authors":["Laura Hayes","Graeme Hawthorne","John Farhall","Brendan O'Hanlon","Carol Harvey","Hayes L","Hawthorne G","Farhall J","O'Hanlon B","Harvey C","Brendan O\u2019Hanlon"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10597-015-9848-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-19T13:17:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1573-2789","0010-3853"],"issue":"5","journal":"Community Mental Health Journal","last_mentioned_on":1479697694,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25690154?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25690154\/","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10597-015-9848-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25690154","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10597-015-9848-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10597-015-9848-6.pdf","pmid":"25690154","pubdate":"2015-02-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Community and Environmental Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Quality of Life and Social Isolation Among Caregivers of Adults with Schizophrenia: Policy and Outcomes","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10597-015-9848-6","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quality-life-social-isolation-among-caregivers-adults-schizophrenia-policy-outcomes-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.95,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317802,"mean":7.008607503105,"rank":1011129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7304822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317802,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212995,"mean":9.1851515535649,"rank":34143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":178759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212995,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":3.8871577287066,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.2,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
