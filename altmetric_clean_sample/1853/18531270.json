In the heart, the accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) has been proposed to play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. We obtain cholesterol from animals and animal-derived foods such as milk, eggs and cheese. In previous studies, the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was shown to be important for our health. High levels of LDL cholesterol lead to atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of heart attack and ischemic stroke. In this study, we utilized Ox-LDL treated H9c2 cardiomyoblast cells as a simulated hyperlipidemia model. CD36 metabolism pathway proteins (phospho-Akt, SIRT1, PGC1\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1, CPT1\u03b2 and CD36) increased at low doses of Ox-LDL. However, high doses (150 and 200\u2009mg\/dL) of Ox-LDL reduced the levels of these proteins. Interestingly, expression of GLUT4 metabolism pathway proteins (phospho-PKC\u03b6) were reduced at low doses, while the expression of phospho-AMPK, phospho-PI3K, phospho-PKC\u03b6, GLUT4, and PDH proteins increased at high doses. Ox-LDL acute treatment induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes as evidenced by apoptotic nuclei apparition, caspase-3 activation, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In our results, Ox-LDL induced lipotoxicity in cardiomyocytes, and subsequent exposure to short-term hypoxia or reversed the Ox-LDL-induced metabolic imbalance. The same result was obtained with the pharmacological activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol and si-PKC\u03b6. The mechanism of metabolic switching during Ox-LDL lipotoxicity seems to be mediated by SIRT1and PKC \u03b6. This article is protected by copyright.
