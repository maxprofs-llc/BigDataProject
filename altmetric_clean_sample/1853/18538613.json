When applied in a bolus form, they may undergo rapid diffusion and denaturation resulting in failure to induce the desired effects on target cells.\nThe controlled release of BMs from a biomaterial carrier is expected to enhance and accelerate functional tissue engineering during regenerative endodontic procedures. This narrative review presents a comprehensive review of different polymeric BM release strategies with relevance to dentin-pulp engineering.\nCarrier systems designed to allow the preprogrammed release of BMs in a spatial- and temporal-controlled manner would aid in mimicking the natural wound healing process while overcoming some of the challenges faced in clinical translation of regenerative endodontic procedures.\nSpatial- and temporal-controlled BM release systems have become an exciting option in dentin-pulp tissue engineering; nonetheless, further validation of this concept and knowledge is required for their potential clinical translation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Suja Shrestha","Anil Kishen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2016.12.020","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T23:35:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00992399","1878-3554"],"journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1493908886,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28320538?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099-2399%2816%2931066-4\/fulltext?elsca1=etoc&amp%3Belsca2=email&amp%3Belsca3=0099-2399_201705_43_5_&amp%3Belsca4=Dentistry#.WQs9i8FW58c.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jendodon.com\/article\/S0099239916310664\/pdf","pmid":"28320538","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Bioactive Molecule Delivery Systems for Dentin-pulp Tissue Engineering","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioactive-molecule-delivery-systems-dentinpulp-tissue-engineering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155745,"mean":6.9068271228166,"rank":4320957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2264032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155745,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240111,"mean":13.047548606888,"rank":135589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240111,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":941,"mean":1.4931829787234,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":941,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":0.98333333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UofTDentLib\/statuses\/849767397649248256","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18538613],"posted_on":"2017-04-05T23:35:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Dentistry Library","url":"http:\/\/www.library.utoronto.ca\/dentistry\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1266012091\/Tooth_normal.jpg","description":"The Dentistry Library at the University of Toronto holds the largest academic dental collection in Canada.","id_on_source":"UofTDentLib","tweeter_id":"262782584","geo":{"lt":43.70011,"ln":-79.4163,"country":"CA"},"followers":1924},"tweet_id":"849767397649248256"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/endogarrido\/statuses\/860142327372935168","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18538613],"posted_on":"2017-05-04T14:41:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Roman Martinez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/788792419995136000\/fGy_0UoD_normal.jpg","description":"Cirujano Dentista Especialista en Endodoncia.","id_on_source":"endogarrido","tweeter_id":"104023421","geo":{"lt":17.98689,"ln":-92.93028,"country":"MX"},"followers":1122},"tweet_id":"860142327372935168"}]}}
