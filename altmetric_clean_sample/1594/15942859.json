Latest updates in the world of strigolactones."],"citation":{"abstract":"Strigolactones are a structurally diverse class of plant hormones that control many aspects of shoot and root growth. Strigolactones are also exuded by plants into the rhizosphere, where they promote symbiotic interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and germination of root parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae family. Therefore, understanding how strigolactones are made, transported, and perceived may lead to agricultural innovations as well as a deeper knowledge of how plants function. Substantial progress has been made in these areas over the past decade. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms, core developmental roles, and evolutionary history of strigolactone signaling. We also propose potential translational applications of strigolactone research to agriculture. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Plant Biology Volume 68 is April 29, 2017.
