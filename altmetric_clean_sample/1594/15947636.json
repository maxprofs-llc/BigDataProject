Two polyoxometalates (POMs) were isomorphic with manganese (Mn(2+)) and cobalt (Co(2+)) compounds, (Himi)2[(BiW9O33)2(W(OH)2)2(Mn(H2O)3)2(Na3(H2O)14)]\u00b716H2O (1) and (H2imi)2[(BiW9O33)2(W(OH)2)2(Co(H2O)3)2Na4 (H2O)14]\u00b717H2O (2), which were reported in a previous study. This study continued with the determination of the inhibitory effects of four POMs on human hepatic carcinoma Hep G2 cells. Four compounds were used to compare their effects on the measurement of the sub-G1 (sub-G1 hypodiploid cell population) DNA content, the analysis of nuclear morphology, and the protein expression. The results showed that compound 3 (IC50 = 25.6 \u00b1 1.07 \u03bcmol L(-1)) had a much higher anti-tumor activity than compounds 1 and 4 in Hep G2 cells. Compound 2 had the lowest anti-tumor activities in Hep G2 cells. However, compound 3 showed much higher cytotoxicity than compounds 1, 2 and 4 in QSG-7701 cells. Compound 4 had the lowest cytotoxicity of all of these compounds. These findings indicate the effective relationship between the metal components and structures, and their antitumor activities in Hep G2 cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Lu Wang","Kai Yu","Jiang Zhu","Baibin Zhou","Jiaren LIU","Yang Guo-Yu"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6dt02420c","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T15:36:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-9234"],"issue":"9","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1485790593,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/DT\/C6DT02420C?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=inorganicnews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/dt\/c6dt02420c","pmid":"28245011","pubdate":"2017-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Inhibitory effects of substituted different transition metal-based Krebs-type sandwich structure on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effects-different-substituted-transition-metalbased-krebstype-sandwich-structures-human-h"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":7061666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262670,"mean":12.809967350543,"rank":217563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262670,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11163,"mean":0.69900842142985,"rank":3178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11163,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":466,"mean":1.1450537634409,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":466,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
