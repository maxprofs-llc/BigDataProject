The main limitations of the HT for usage in actual applications are computation time and storage requirements. This paper reports a hardware architecture for HT implementation on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with parallelized voting procedure. The 2-dimensional accumulator array, namely the Hough space in parametric form (\u03c1, \u03b8), for computing the strength of each line by a voting mechanism is mapped on a 1-dimensional array with regular increments of \u03b8. Then, this Hough space is divided into a number of parallel parts. The computation of (\u03c1, \u03b8) for the edge pixels and the voting procedure for straight-line determination are therefore executable in parallel. In addition, a synchronized initialization for the Hough space further increases the speed of straight-line detection, so that XGA video processing becomes possible. The designed prototype system has been synthesized on a DE4 platform with a Stratix-IV FPGA device. In the application of road-lane detection, the average processing speed of this HT implementation is 5.4ms per XGA-frame at 200 MHz working frequency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Jungang Guan","Fengwei An","Xiangyu Zhang","Lei Chen","Hans Mattausch"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17020270","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T14:39:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"2","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1485785747,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/270?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/270?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/2\/270\/pdf","pmid":"28146101","pubdate":"2017-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Real-Time Straight-Line Detection for XGA-Size Videos by Hough Transform with Parallelized Voting Procedures","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/realtime-straightline-detection-xgasize-videos-hough-transform-parallelized-voting-procedures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":4329334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2257050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262670,"mean":12.809966398775,"rank":149806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262670,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3348,"mean":1.9370086644756,"rank":1058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3348,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":577,"mean":1.6848715277778,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":577,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
