Here, we demonstrate the in vivo antibacterial activity of carba-\u03b1-D-glucosamine (CGlcN). In this mode of action study, we provide evidence that CGlcN-mediated growth inhibition is due to glmS ribozyme activation and we demonstrate that CGlcN hijacks an endogenous activation pathway, hence utilizing a prodrug mechanism. This is the first report describing antibacterial activity mediated by activating the self-cleaving properties of a ribozyme. Our results open the path towards a compound class with an entirely novel and distinct molecular mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Sch\u00fcller, Anna","Matzner, Daniel","L\u00fcnse, Christina E.","Wittmann, Valentin","Schumacher, Catherine","Unsleber, Sandra","Br\u00f6tz\u2010Oesterhelt, Heike","Mayer, Christoph","Bierbaum, Gabriele","Mayer, G\u00fcnter"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201600491","first_seen_on":"2017-01-30T10:43:28+00:00","issns":["14394227","1439-7633"],"journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1485821367,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201600491\/abstract;jsessionid=2936BB9394CEA780AB2FE8192FD85A7C.f01t02","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/cbic.201600491?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201600491\/pdf","pmid":"28012261","pubdate":"2017-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Activation of the\n              glmS\n              Ribozyme Confers Bacterial Growth Inhibition\n            ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/cbic.201600491","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-glms-ribozyme-confers-bacterial-growth-inhibition"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":3819196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4305321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262832,"mean":12.80675351842,"rank":126182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":134799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262832,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2026,"mean":2.4471298765432,"rank":545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2026,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":2.222,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
