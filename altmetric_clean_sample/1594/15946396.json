Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new CNT-based contrast agent (CA) for X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging. The CA is a hybrid material derived from ultra-short single-walled carbon nanotubes (20-80 nm long, US-tubes) and Bi(III) oxo-salicylate clusters with four Bi(III) ions per cluster (Bi4C). The element bismuth was chosen over iodine, which is the conventional element used for CT CAs in the clinic today, due to its high X-ray attenuation capability and its low toxicity, which make bismuth a more promising element for new CT CA design. The new CA contains 20% by weight bismuth with no detectable release of bismuth after a 48 h challenge by various biological media at 37 \u1d52C, demonstrating the presence of a strong interaction between the two components of the hybrid material. The performance of the new Bi4C@US-tube solid material as a CT CA has been assessed using a clinical scanner and found to possess an X-ray attenuation ability of >2000 Hounsfield units (HU).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Mayra Hern\u00e1ndez-Rivera","Ish Kumar","Stephen Y.
