Various fabrication methods like drawing, template synthesis, fiber-mesh, phase separation, fiber-bonding, self-assembly, melt-blown, and electrospinning are successfully used for fabrication of nanofibers. These formulations are widely used in various fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, cosmetics, as filter media, protective clothing, wound dressing, homeostatic, sensor devices, etc. The present review gives a detailed account on the need of the nanofiber scaffold formulation development along with the biomaterials and techniques implemented for fabrication of the same against innumerable diseases. At present, there is a huge extent of research being performed worldwide on all aspects of biomolecules delivery. The unique characteristics of nanofibers such as higher loading efficiency, superior mechanical performance (stiffness and tensile strength), controlled release behavior, and excellent stability helps in the delivery of plasmid DNA, large protein drugs, genetic materials, and autologous stem-cell to the target site in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fc1","authors":["Tarun Garg","Goutam Rath","Amit K Goyal","Amit K.
