By phosphorylating crucial molecules such as c-Jun, p53, and Bcl-2, active JNK regulates cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy (Bogoyevitch et\u00a0al., 2010). Previous studies of JNK in cancer cells have produced paradoxical findings, with some supporting a pro-oncogenic function and others demonstrating its role as a tumor suppressor (Bogoyevitch et\u00a0al., 2010; Tournier, 2013). To date, the role of JNK in melanoma remains ambiguous. This article is protected by copyright.
