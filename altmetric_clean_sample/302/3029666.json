The use of cutting-edge techniques for minimally invasive surgery enables surgeons to deliver various treatment options to minimize a patient's distress and to maintain oncologic safety. Ongoing multicenter prospective studies aim to validate the efficacy of these surgical techniques and to expand the indications of minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of gastric cancer. In this review, we summarize the current status and issues regarding minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of gastric cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc21","authors":["Son T","Kwon IG","Hyung WJ"],"doi":"10.5009\/gnl.2014.8.3.229","first_seen_on":"2015-01-01T11:25:46+00:00","issns":["1976-2283"],"issue":"3","journal":"Gut and Liver","last_mentioned_on":1420110996,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24827617?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24827617","pubdate":"2014-05-16T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Minimally Invasive Surgery for Gastric Cancer Treatment: Current Status and Future Perspectives.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minimally-invasive-surgery-gastric-cancer-treatment-current-status-future-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":2412023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1665574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156152,"mean":8.3644478613651,"rank":79459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":58059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156152,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.7110091743119,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":6.6,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
