(P. Comba)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Mononuclear nonheme Mn(IV) \uf8feO complexes with two isomers of a bispidine ligand have been synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopies and density functional theory (DFT). The Mn(IV) \uf8feO complexes show reactivity in oxidation reactions (hydrogen-atom abstraction and sulfoxidation). Interestingly, one of the isomers (L(1) ) is significantly more reactive than the other (L(2) ), while in the corresponding Fe(IV) \uf8feO based oxidation reactions the L(2) -based system was previously found to be more reactive than the L(1) -based catalyst. This inversion of reactivities is discussed on the basis of DFT and molecular mechanics (MM) model calculations, which indicate that the order of reactivities are primarily due to a switch of reaction channels (\u03c3 versus \u03c0) and concomitant steric effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Barman, Prasenjit","Vardhaman, Anil Kumar","Martin, Bodo","W\u00f6rner, Svenja J.","Sastri, Chivukula V.","Comba, Peter"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201409476","endpage":"2099","first_seen_on":"2014-12-29T20:34:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"7","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
