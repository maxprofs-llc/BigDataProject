Although pharmacological treatment of insomnia is available, most hypnotics have been shown to alter sleep architecture and have many adverse effects. Gabapentin was originally designed for antiepileptic therapy; however, some studies reported that its use increases slow-wave sleep in healthy volunteers or patients. Our goal was to evaluate the benefits of gabapentin in the treatment of primary insomnia in patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f0e","authors":["Lo HS","Yang CM","Lo HG","Lee CY","Ting H","Tzang BS","Hsiao-Sui Lo","Chien-Ming Yang","Helen G.
