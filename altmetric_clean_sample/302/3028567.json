Two acyclic open chain tetra(NHC) precursors are synthesized together with their corresponding silver complexes. On the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, the coordination geometry of the silver complexes is discussed. Dependent on the length of the alkyl bridge of the tetradentate ligand either a double helix structure with four linear-coordinated silver cations or a twisted geometry with two linear-coordinated silver cations is obtained.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Daniel T.
