All 10 investigated mushroom species inhibited the reproduction of influenza virus strain A\/FM\/1\/47 (H1N1) in MDCK cells reducing the infectious titer by 2.0-6.0 lg ID50. Four species, Pleurotus ostreatus, Fomes fomentarius, Auriporia aurea, and Trametes versicolor, were also determined to be effective against HSV-2 strain BH in RK-13 cells, with similar levels of inhibition as for influenza. For some of the investigated mushroom species-Pleurotus eryngii, Lyophyllum shimeji, and Flammulina velutipes-this is the first report of an anti-influenza effect. This study also reports the first data on the medicinal properties of A. aurea, including anti-influenza and antiherpetic activities. T. versicolor 353 mycelium was found to have a high therapeutic index (324.67), and may be a promising material for the pharmaceutical industry as an anti-influenza and antiherpetic agent with low toxicity. Mycelia with antiviral activity were obtained in our investigation by bioconversion of agricultural wastes (amaranth flour after CO2 extraction), which would reduce the cost of the final product and solve some ecological problems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c82","authors":["Krupodorova T","Rybalko S","Barshteyn V","Tetiana Krupodorova","Svetlana Rybalko","Victor Barshteyn"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12250-014-3486-y","endpage":"290","first_seen_on":"2015-01-01T09:14:26+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1995-820X","1674-0769"],"issue":"5","journal":"Virologica Sinica","last_mentioned_on":1427706000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25358999?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12250-014-3486-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12250-014-3486-y.pdf","pmid":"25358999","pubdate":"2014-11-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"284","title":"Antiviral activity of Basidiomycete mycelia against influenza type A (serotype H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 in cell culture","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiviral-activity-basidiomycete-mycelia-against-influenza-type-serotype-h1n1-herpes-simplex-virus-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7006056,"mean":6.2581394159739,"rank":349686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6655906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7006056,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231131,"mean":7.6026718556658,"rank":15190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":215925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231131,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.7566170212766,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.89411764705882,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
