Its timely and adequate management is of uttermost importance for both oncological outcomes and patients\u00bf global quality of life. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the role of hypericum perforatum and neem oil (Holoil\u00ae; RIMOS srl, Mirandola, Italy) in the treatment of acute skin toxicity for patients undergoing radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.MethodsA consecutive series of 28 head and neck cancer patients submitted to radiotherapy (RT) was enrolled onto this mono-institutional single-arm prospective observational study between November 2013 and June 2014. Patients undergoing both definitive or post-operative radiotherapy were allowed, either as exclusive modality or combined with (concomitant or induction) chemotherapy. We employed a reactive, rather than a prophylactic approach, starting Holoil treatment whenever bright erythema, moderate oedema or patchy moist desquamation were observed (G2 acute skin toxicity according to the RTOG scoring scale). Holoil\u00ae was used during all RT course and during follow up time, until acute skin toxicity recovery. Twice a day applications were mostly given.ResultsThe maximum detected acute skin toxicity was Grade 1 in 7% of patients, Grade 2 in 68%, Grade 3 in 25%, while at the end of RT was Grade 0 in 3.5% of patients, Grade 1 in 32%, Grade 2 in 61%, Grade 3 in 3.5%. For patients having G2 acute skin toxicity, it mainly started at weeks 4\u00bf5, while for those having G3, it began during weeks 5 and 6. Median times spent with G2 or G3 toxicity during RT were 17.5 and 11\u00a0days. Patients having G2 acute skin toxicity had a worsening of their dermatitis in 27% of case, with a median occurrence time of 7\u00a0days. G3 events were reconverted to a G2 profile in 100% of patients after a median time of 7\u00a0days. Those experiencing a G2 skin event were converted to a G1 score in 23% of cases after a median time of 14\u00a0days. Time between maximum acute skin toxicity and complete skin recovery after RT was 27\u00a0days.ConclusionsHoloil\u00ae proved to be a safe and active option in the management of acute skin toxicity in head and neck cancer patients submitted to RT or chemo-radiotherapy. A prophylactic effect in the prevention of moist desquamation may be hypothesized for hypericum and neem oil and need to be tested within a prospective controlled study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088f","doi":"10.1186\/s13014-014-0297-0","first_seen_on":"2014-12-29T01:03:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-717X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Radiation Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1420308991,"links":["http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/9\/1\/1164\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25544371"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ro-journal.com\/content\/pdf\/s13014-014-0297-0.pdf","pmid":"25544371","pubdate":"2014-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1164","subjects":["neoplasms","radiotherapy"],"title":"Hypericum perforatum and neem oil for the management of acute skin toxicity in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiation or chemo-radiation: a single-arm prospective observational study.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypericum-perforatum-neem-oil-management-acute-skin-toxicity-head-neck-cancer-patients-undergoing-ra-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7918051,"mean":6.6979415254961,"rank":3684680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4055421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7918051,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237555,"mean":7.7512574993476,"rank":97039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":132838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237555,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1066,"mean":2.2913802816901,"rank":412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1066,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.6490243902439,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"SA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/status\/549369448793391104","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3020810],"posted_on":"2014-12-29T01:00:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"549369448793391104"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AbdullAlHargan\/status\/549768437757919232","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3020810],"posted_on":"2014-12-30T03:26:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Abdullah AlHargan","url":"http:\/\/DermClub.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/843211137533513729\/FkTX4pEj_normal.jpg","description":"MD.\nDermatology Resident","id_on_source":"AbdullAlHargan","tweeter_id":"2871641462","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":1870},"tweet_id":"549768437757919232"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Hypericum perforatum and neem oil for the management of acute skin toxicity in head and neck...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/759435357433091\/posts\/830249943684965","license":"public","citation_ids":[3020810],"posted_on":"2014-12-29T01:55:48+00:00","summary":"www.ro-journal.com","author":{"name":"\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\u03a3\u03c6\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/759435357433091","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/759435357433091\/picture","id_on_source":"759435357433091"}},{"title":"Hypericum perforatum and neem oil for the management of acute skin ... - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=958096570885995&id=153661297996197","license":"public","citation_ids":[3020810],"posted_on":"2015-01-03T18:16:31+00:00","summary":"Holoil to manage radiation induced skin toxicity?
