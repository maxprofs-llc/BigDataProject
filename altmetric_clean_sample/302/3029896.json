Sunlight exposure promoted the growth of algae in the SBR (Rs), forming an algal-bacterial symbiosis in aerobic granules. Compared to the control SBR (Rc), Rs had a slower granulation process with granules of loose structure and smaller particle size. Moreover, the specific oxygen uptake rate was significantly decreased for the granules from Rs with secretion of 25.7% and 22.5% less proteins and polysaccharides respectively in the extracellular polymeric substances. Although little impact was observed on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, algal-bacterial symbiosis deteriorated N and P removals, about 40.7-45.4% of total N and 44% of total P in Rs in contrast to 52.9-58.3% of TN and 90% of TP in Rc, respectively. In addition, the growth of algae altered the microbial community in Rs, especially unfavorable for Nitrospiraceae and Nitrosomonadaceae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Huang W","Li B","Zhang C","Zhang Z","Lei Z","Lu B","Zhou B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2014.12.024","first_seen_on":"2015-01-01T12:10:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0960-8524"],"issue":"","journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1419939005,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25544496?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25544496","pubdate":"2014-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Effect of algae growth on aerobic granulation and nutrients removal from synthetic wastewater by using sequencing batch reactors.","type":"article","volume":"179C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-algae-growth-aerobic-granulation-nutrients-removal-synthetic-wastewater-using-sequencing-batc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156151,"mean":8.3645174383607,"rank":122602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156151,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1138,"mean":2.0121741424802,"rank":760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1138,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.3768292682927,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
