The effects of amendments and plants on the availability and mobility of heavy metals were evaluated using single extraction, sequential extraction, pore-water analysis, and determination of heavy metal concentrations in plants. The application of Fe-rich amendments significantly reduced the amount of soluble and extractable heavy metals in the tailings (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furnace slag and M.\u00a0sinensis reduced CaCl2-extractable heavy metals by 56-91%, red mud and P.\u00a0aquilinum treatment was the most effective at decreasing bioaccessible Pb, reducing it to 34% of the total Pb. Compared to control, water soluble Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were reduced by 99, 99, 98, and 99%, respectively, in the red mud and P.\u00a0aquilinum tailings. M.\u00a0sinensis accumulated heavy metals mainly in the root, and had lower translocation factors compared with P. aquilinum. The results of this study suggest that M.\u00a0sinensis can be used in aided phytostabilization for these types of mine tailings and Fe-rich amendments are effective for the in situ immobilization of metals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f13cf058f610002d88","authors":["Lee SH","Ji W","Lee WS","Koo N","Koh IH","Kim MS","Park JS"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jenvman.2014.02.019","first_seen_on":"2014-12-30T12:59:07+00:00","issns":["0301-4797"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Environmental Management","last_mentioned_on":1419944259,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24681360?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24681360","pubdate":"2014-04-01T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Influence of amendments and aided phytostabilization on metal availability and mobility in Pb\/Zn mine tailings.","type":"article","volume":"139C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-amendments-aided-phytostabilization-metal-availability-mobility-pbzn-mine-tailings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155991,"mean":8.3786371946921,"rank":122407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155991,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":625,"mean":3.5368269230769,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":625,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.9309523809524,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
