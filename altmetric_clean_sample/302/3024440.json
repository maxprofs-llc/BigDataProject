Three benthic filamentous algae species Cladophora sp., Klebsormidium sp. and Pseudanabaena sp. were isolated from a periphyton bioreactor and cultured under laboratory conditions on varying N\/P ratios to determine their ability to remove nitrate and phosphorus. The N\/P ratio significantly influenced the algal growth and phosphorus uptake process. Appropriate N\/P ratios for nitrogen and phosphorus removal were 5-15, 7-10 and 7-20 for Cladophora sp., Klebsormidium sp. and Pseudanabaena sp., respectively. Within these respective ranges, Cladophora sp. had the highest biomass production, while Pseudanabaena sp. had the highest nitrogen and phosphorus contents. This study indicated that Cladophora sp. had a high capacity of removing phosphorus from wastewaters of low N\/P ratio, and Pseudanabaena sp. was highly suitable for removing nitrogen from wastewaters with high N\/P ratio.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Junzhuo Liu","Wim Vyverman","Liu J","Vyverman W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2014.12.028","endpage":"242","first_seen_on":"2014-12-30T11:56:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-5904624","handles":["1854\/LU-5904624"],"issns":["1873-2976","0960-8524","09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1419940553,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25544498?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biortech.2014.12.028"],"pmid":"25544498","pubdate":"2014-12-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"234","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Differences in nutrient uptake capacity of the benthic filamentous algae Cladophora sp., Klebsormidium sp. and Pseudanabaena sp. under varying N\/P conditions.","type":"article","volume":"179C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differences-nutrient-uptake-capacity-benthic-filamentous-algae-cladophora-sp-klebsormidium-sp-pseuda"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082125,"mean":6.8620310405946,"rank":6996800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082125,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238859,"mean":7.8911062723459,"rank":190964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238859,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2063,"mean":2.2312230843841,"rank":1439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2063,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":1.4215789473684,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
