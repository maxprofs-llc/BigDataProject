The images revealed multiple regions of abnormal hypermetabolism throughout the body. Notably, there was an intense activity in the region of pituitary stalk. Pathological results after biopsy showed pituitary involvement of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Huijun Ju","Yu Pan","Jing Lv","Xinwu Mao","Yifan Zhang"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000000654","first_seen_on":"2014-12-30T11:17:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-0229","0363-9762"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433395033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25546208?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25546208?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Abstract\/2015\/06000\/Pituitary_Involvement_of_Langerhans_Cell.14.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/2015\/06000\/Pituitary_Involvement_of_Langerhans_Cell.14.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"25546208","pubdate":"2014-12-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Pituitary Involvement of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in an Adult Unveiled by FDG PET\/CT","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pituitary-involvement-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-adult-unveiled-fdg-petct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5187054,"mean":6.1241286456898,"rank":1905912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3255886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5187054,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182336,"mean":8.2340614144296,"rank":54559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":126602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182336,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2025,"mean":0.86377272727273,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2025,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":0.88203883495146,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5},"mendeley":{"US":1,"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/status\/550076000642428928","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3024289],"posted_on":"2014-12-30T23:48:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24805},"tweet_id":"550076000642428928"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HAVAtesting\/status\/550076408387870720","license":"datasift","rt":["usmolecular"],"citation_ids":[3024289],"posted_on":"2014-12-30T23:50:10+00:00","author":{"name":"HAVAtesting","url":"http:\/\/www.havatesting.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/432571901165060096\/nzrdMNNM_normal.png","description":"#HAVAtesting online proficiency testing for #Histopathology, #MohsCertification, #mohs, #pathology, #Histology #dermatology, #histotech,#KOH,#CLIA,#LabSetUp","id_on_source":"HAVAtesting","tweeter_id":"2329522178","geo":{"lt":26.66396,"ln":-80.71617,"country":"US"},"followers":1017},"tweet_id":"550076408387870720"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fisicamedica\/status\/550487096004456448","license":"datasift","rt":["usmolecular"],"citation_ids":[3024289],"posted_on":"2015-01-01T03:02:05+00:00","author":{"name":"F\u00edsica M\u00e9dica","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/396148773\/logo_amarelo_normal.jpg","description":"Tweeting about medical physics and related subjects.
