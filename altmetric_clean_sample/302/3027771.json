Subsequently, Sr2 has been widely deployed and has provided durable partial resistance to all known races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. This report describes the physical map of the Sr2-carrying region on the short arm of chromosome 3B of cv Hope and compares the Hope haplotype with non-Sr2 wheat cv Chinese Spring.Results Sr2 was located to a region of 867\u00a0kb on chromosome 3B in Hope, which corresponded to a region of 567\u00a0kb in Chinese Spring. The Hope Sr2 region carried 34 putative genes but only 17 were annotated in the comparable region of Chinese Spring. The two haplotypes differed by extensive DNA sequence polymorphisms between flanking markers as well as by a major insertion\/deletion event including ten Germin-Like Protein (GLP) genes in Hope that were absent in Chinese Spring. Haplotype analysis of a limited number of wheat genotypes of interest showed that all wheat genotypes carrying Sr2 possessed the GLP cluster; while, of those lacking Sr2, some, including Marquis, possessed the cluster, while some lacked it. Thus, this region represents a common presence-absence polymorphism in wheat, with presence of the cluster not correlated with presence of Sr2. Comparison of Hope and Marquis GLP genes on 3BS found no polymorphisms in the coding regions of the ten genes but several SNPs in the shared promoter of one divergently transcribed GLP gene pair and a single SNP downstream of the transcribed region of a second GLP.ConclusionPhysical mapping and sequence comparison showed major haplotype divergence at the Sr2 locus between Hope and Chinese Spring. Candidate genes within the Sr2 region of Hope are being evaluated for the ability to confer stem rust resistance. Based on the detailed mapping and sequencing of the locus, we predict that Sr2 does not belong to the NB-LRR gene family and is not related to previously cloned, race non-specific rust resistance genes Lr34 and Yr36.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d4","authors":["Mago R","Tabe L","Vautrin S","Imkov\u00e1 H","Kubal\u00e1kov\u00e1 M","Upadhyaya N","Berges H","Kong X","Breen J","Dole El J","Appels R","Ellis J","Spielmeyer W","Rohit Mago","Linda Tabe","Sonia Vautrin","Hana \u0160imkov\u00e1","Marie Kubal\u00e1kov\u00e1","Narayana Upadhyaya","H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Berges","Xiuying Kong","James Breen","Jaroslav Dole\u017eel","Rudi Appels","Jeffrey G Ellis","Wolfgang Spielmeyer"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12870-014-0379-z","first_seen_on":"2014-12-31T16:28:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"2440\/93016","handles":["2440\/93016"],"issns":["1471-2229"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1446587073,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2229\/14\/1585\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25547135","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25547135?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/s12870-014-0379-z"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12870-014-0379-z.pdf","pmid":"25547135","pubdate":"2014-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1585","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Major haplotype divergence including multiple germin-like protein genes, at the wheat Sr2 adult plant stem rust resistance locus.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12870-014-0379-z","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/major-haplotype-divergence-including-multiple-germinlike-protein-genes-wheat-sr2-adult-plant-stem-ru"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8073544,"mean":6.8525437944593,"rank":3375046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4647591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8073544,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237551,"mean":7.8905940896653,"rank":80933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":154240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237551,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1122,"mean":3.3702854594112,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1122,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":3.4061914893617,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
