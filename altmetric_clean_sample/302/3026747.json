Biological evaluation revealed that almost all of the new compounds displayed high antiproliferative activity against the tested cells and moderate to potent antibacterial activities. Interestingly, these compounds were active against Candida albicans biofilms at doses significantly lower than those required against free-floating planktonic fungal cells. The most promising compounds are derivatives with glycine and L-proline as a substituent both at 2 and at 9 position of 5H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoline. In general, these new compounds (2a, 3a, 6a and 7a) showed the highest dual action against cancer lines and infectious pathogenic microbes in vitro.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Sidoryk K","Jaromin A","Edward JA","Switalska M","Stefa\u0144ska J","Cmoch P","Zagrodzka J","Szczepek W","Peczy\u0144ska-Czoch W","Wietrzyk J","Kozubek A","Zarnowski R","Andes DR","Kaczmarek L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2014.03.060","first_seen_on":"2014-12-31T06:36:11+00:00","issns":["0223-5234"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1420007706,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24686017?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24686017","pubdate":"2014-04-02T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Searching for new derivatives of neocryptolepine: Synthesis, antiproliferative, antimicrobial and antifungal activities.","type":"article","volume":"78C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/searching-new-derivatives-neocryptolepine-synthesis-antiproliferative-antimicrobial-antifungal-activ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":3799437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155199,"mean":8.3825578680139,"rank":121885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155199,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":671,"mean":1.2294447761194,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":671,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.2202380952381,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
