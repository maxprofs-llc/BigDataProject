The broad functional group tolerance of the cycloaddition reaction and further palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions allowed the preparation of polyfunctionalized 1,4,5-pyrazoles that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Elodie Decuypere"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol503482a","first_seen_on":"2014-12-29T20:37:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1419885261,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol503482a"],"pmid":"25545588","pubdate":"2014-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Copper(I)-Catalyzed Cycloaddition of 4-Bromosydnones and Alkynes for the Regioselective Synthesis of 1,4,5-Trisubstituted Pyrazoles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coppericatalyzed-cycloaddition-4bromosydnones-alkynes-regioselective-synthesis-145trisubstituted-pyr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
