It uses readily available measures, and it is based on regression analysis from actual data rather than a theoretical model. However, the necessary calculations are too complex to perform with anything other than a scientific calculator or dedicated software, which may create issues in a clinical setting where access to electronic devices may be limited. We designed a nomogram capable of performing the calculation to a high degree of accuracy, and evaluated its performance on a set of randomly generated patient data to ensure that the nomogram gives accurate and repeatable results. The nomogram has a bias of -0.003 percentage points, with limits of agreement -0.3619 to 0.3550 and a repeatability coefficient of 0.29 percentage points. We feel that the nomogram's accuracy, low cost, speed and ease of use would make it a very useful adjunct during the initial assessment of burns patients. It could also realistically be used to crosscheck calculations made by other methods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000247d","authors":["Williams DJ","Walker JD"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.burns.2014.05.001","first_seen_on":"2014-12-30T11:03:56+00:00","issns":["0305-4179","03054179"],"issue":"1","journal":"Burns (03054179)","last_mentioned_on":1419953066,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305417914001661#fig0010","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305417914001661","http:\/\/authors.elsevier.com\/a\/1QGVC15SQcHQZz"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.burnsjournal.com\/article\/S0305417914001661\/pdf","pmid":"24934520","pubdate":"2015-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"85","title":"A nomogram for calculation of the Revised Baux Score ","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nomogram-calculation-revised-baux-score"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6418914,"mean":5.8842227782189,"rank":795815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5621265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6418914,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194094,"mean":8.294965825661,"rank":32027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":161977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194094,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":597,"mean":5.378744966443,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":597,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.4493125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Social Sciences":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":7,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasondwalker\/status\/549657333312520192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3024208],"posted_on":"2014-12-29T20:04:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Jason Walker","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/477688273\/me__Small__normal.jpg","description":"Irish.
