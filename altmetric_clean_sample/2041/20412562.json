Selection for MAS or LAP was based on surgeon preference. To minimize selection bias, preoperative imaging was reviewed for all LAP cases. In this manner, we identified potential MAS candidates, who were used in the comparison. Intent-to-treat analyses were undertaken using statistical testing.\n170 cases were identified (131 LAP, 8 LSC, 31 RBT). 68\/131 (52%) LAP cases were deemed potential candidates for MAS. Feasibility analyses included 68 LAP and 39 MAS cases. Six (15%) MAS cases were converted to LAP. Median age, BMI, operative time did not differ significantly between the groups. Complete gross resection was achieved in 37\/39 (95%) MAS, 63\/68 (93%) LAP (P=1.0). Median estimated blood loss was 50cm(3) (range, 5-500) MAS, 150cm(3) (range, 0-1500) LAP (P=0.001). Median length of stay was 1day (range, 0-23) MAS, 5days (range, 1-21) LAP (P<0.001). Complications occurred in 3\/39 (8%) MAS, 15\/68 (22%) LAP (P=0.06). The 2-year progression-free survival was 56.1% (SE 9%) MAS, 63.5% (SE 6%) LAP (P=1.0). The 2-year overall survival was 92.2% (SE 5.4%) MAS, 81.4% (SE 5.5%) LAP (P=0.7).\nMAS for SSCR is feasible in properly selected cases. MAS is associated with favorable perioperative outcomes and similar oncologic outcomes, compared to LAP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000299b","authors":["Ane Gerda Z.
