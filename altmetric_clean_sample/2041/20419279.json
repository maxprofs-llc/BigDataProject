Tumor cells acquire an ability to digest the extracellular matrix and infiltrate the adjacent normal tissue during invasion. Restraining GBM invasion by changing effector molecules can significantly improve the patient's prognosis. MiRNAs are involved in multiple biological functions via suppressing target genes. In this study, we found that miR-106a-5p expression was high in GBM tissues and cells. The data showed an inverse correlation in GBM tissues between the levels of miR-106a-5p and adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) mRNAs.Additionally, ectopic expression of miR-106a-5pfacilitated the invasion of GBM cells whereas inhibition of miR-106a-5p expression weakened the invasive ability. Numerous transcription factors are downstream effectors of the Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Target prediction databases and luciferase data showed that APC is a new direct target of miR-106a-5p. Importantly, westernblot assays demonstrated that miR-106a-5p can reduce APC protein level and enhance target proteins of Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that miR-106a-5p directly targets APC, resulting in the activation of Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Our results suggest that miR-106a-5p is involved in the invasive behaviorof GBM cells and by targeting APC and activating Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway, it provides a theoretical basis for developing potential clinical strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Dazhi Li","Zengliang Wang","Zigui Chen","Lin Lin","Yongxin Wang","Duishanbai Sailike","Kun Luo","Guojia Du","Xinggang Xiang","Geng Dangmuren Jiafu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2016.10.132","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T19:24:15+00:00","issns":["0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1495565134,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27815074?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27815074","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"MicroRNA-106a-5p facilitates human glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion by targeting adenomatosis polyposis coli protein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna106a5p-facilitates-human-glioblastoma-cell-proliferation-invasion-targeting-adenomatosis-pol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7140001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237280,"mean":12.123736976302,"rank":192375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8750,"mean":2.7427017944908,"rank":7438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8750,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":1.2503088803089,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
