To qualitatively compare students' attitudes and perceptions regarding team-based learning (TBL) and lecture. Design. Students were exposed to TBL and lecture in an elective pharmacotherapeutics course in a randomized, prospective, cross-over design. After completing the course, students provided their attitudes and perceptions through a written self-reflection and narrative questions on the end-of-course evaluation. Student responses were reviewed using a grounded theory coding method. Assessment. Students' responses yielded five major themes: impact of TBL on learning, perceptions about TBL learning methods, changes in approaches to learning, building skills for professional practice, and enduring challenges. Overall, students report TBL enhances their learning of course content (knowledge and application), teamwork skills, and lifelong learning skills. Conclusion. Students' attitudes and perceptions support TBL as a viable pedagogy for teaching pharmacotherapeutics.","authors":["Remington, Tami L","Bleske, Barry E","Bartholomew, Tracy","Dorsch, Michael P","Guthrie, Sally K","Klein, Kristin C","Tingen, Jeffrey M","Wells, Trisha D"],"doi":"10.5688\/ajpe81355","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T14:00:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1553-6467"],"issue":"3","journal":"American journal of pharmaceutical education","last_mentioned_on":1496697043,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajpe.org\/doi\/full\/10.5688\/ajpe81355","http:\/\/www.ajpe.org\/doi\/abs\/10.5688\/ajpe81355"],"pmcid":"PMC5423071","pmid":"28496275","subjects":["education","pharmacy"],"title":"Qualitative Analysis of Student Perceptions Comparing Team-based Learning and Traditional Lecture in a Pharmacotherapeutics Course.","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/qualitative-analysis-student-perceptions-comparing-teambased-learning-traditional-lecture-pharmacoth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":5.3,"6m":5.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
