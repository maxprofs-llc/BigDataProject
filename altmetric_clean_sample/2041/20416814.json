Although under-five mortality in South Asia, including Bangladesh, has reduced substantially, the rate of neonatal mortality is still high. The study aims to identify factors associated with the practice of antenatal and\/or postnatal care amongst mothers of newborns from a healthcare facility in a selected area of rural Bangladesh. RESEARCH DESIGN\/SETTING: a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 360 postnatal mothers, who were within 42 days of delivery. The study was conducted at Madhupur Upazila (sub-district) in Tangail district of Bangladesh from January 2012 to June 2012. A structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant information from the study subjects.\nonly one in seven (14.2%) of the mothers visited health care facility for 4 or more times to receive antenatal care. A higher proportion of mothers delivered at home, thirty-five percent of the respondents experienced post-delivery complications. About 18% of mothers received postnatal care from the health care facility. Several variables revealed significant associations in bivariate analyses; few variables remained significant for antenatal care and post-natal care categories in the multinomial logistic regression analysis. The likelihood of receiving either antenatal care or post-natal care (OR =0.30, 95% CI =0.10-0.96) was significantly lower among mothers who had either no education or less education (1-5 years of schooling); and was found significantly higher for women who watched TV (OR = 2.79; 95% CI = 1.45-5.37); family income showed significant association for receiving both antenatal care and postnatal care services as well.\nmother's education appears to have a strong and significant association with antenatal care and postnatal care practices in rural Bangladesh. Community based intervention and regular home visits by health care providers could enhance care for women and newborns including delivery of specific health messages. Counseling could be integrated during antenatal care visits to increase the postnatal care service further.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b3b","authors":["Shahjahan, Md","Chowdhury, Hasina Akhter","Al-Hadhrami, Ahmed Y.","Harun, Golam Dostogir","Md Shahjahan","Hasina Akhter Chowdhury","Ahmed Y.
