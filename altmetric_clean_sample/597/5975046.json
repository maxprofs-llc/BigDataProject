However, acquisition of sufficient chilling during winter dormancy ensures the normal phenological traits in subsequent growing period. Thus, low temperature appears to play crucial roles in growth and development of temperate plants. Apple, being an important temperate fruit crop, also requires sufficient chilling to release winter dormancy and normal phenological traits, which are often associated with yield and quality of fruits. DNA cytosine methylation is one of the important epigenetic modifications which remarkably affect the gene expression during various developmental and adaptive processes. In present study, methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism was employed to assess the changes in cytosine methylation during dormancy, active growth and fruit set in apple, under differential chilling conditions. Under high chill conditions, total methylation was decreased from 27.2% in dormant bud to 21.0% in fruit set stage, while no significant reduction was found under low chill conditions. Moreover, the demethylation was found to be decreased, while methylation increased from dormant bud to fruit set stage under low chill as compared to high chill conditions. In addition, RNA-Seq analysis showed high expression of DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases during dormancy and fruit set, and low expression of DNA glcosylases during active growth under low chill conditions, which was in accordance with changes in methylation patterns. The RNA-Seq data of 47 genes associated with MSAP fragments involved in cellular metabolism, stress response, antioxidant system and transcriptional regulation showed correlation between methylation and their expression. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of selected genes also showed correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression. Moreover, significant association between chilling and methylation changes was observed, which suggested that chilling acquisition during dormancy in apple is likely to affect the epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Gulshan Kumar","Usha Kumari Rattan","Anil Kumar Singh","Kumar, Gulshan","Rattan, Usha Kumari","Singh, Anil Kumar"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0149934","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T17:19:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1456327753,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0149934","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26901339?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0149934.PDF","pmid":"26901339","pubdate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0149934","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Chilling-Mediated DNA Methylation Changes during Dormancy and Its Release Reveal the Importance of Epigenetic Regulation during Winter Dormancy in Apple ( Malus x domestica Borkh.)","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chillingmediated-dna-methylation-changes-during-dormancy-release-reveal-importance-epigenetic-regula"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7269211,"mean":6.3660833867746,"rank":2879799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4343559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7269211,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283807,"mean":10.401367532751,"rank":105784,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":174988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283807,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104744,"mean":10.108013843407,"rank":41070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":62006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104744,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5426,"mean":11.962341013825,"rank":2362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5426,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
