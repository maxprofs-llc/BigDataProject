Applications have extended to coherent nonlinear Raman spectroscopy of molecules and quantum metrology for entangled atomic qubits. Frequency combs will create novel possibilities in nano-photonics and plasmonics; however, its interrelation with surface plasmons is unexplored despite the important role that plasmonics plays in nonlinear spectroscopy and quantum optics through the manipulation of light on a subwavelength scale. Here, we demonstrate that a frequency comb can be transformed to a plasmonic comb in plasmonic nanostructures and reverted to the original frequency comb without noticeable degradation of <6.51 \u00d7 10(-19) in absolute position, 2.92 \u00d7 10(-19) in stability and 1\u2009Hz in linewidth. The results indicate that the superior performance of a well-defined frequency comb can be applied to nanoplasmonic spectroscopy, quantum metrology and subwavelength photonic circuits.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Xiao Tao Geng","Byung Jae Chun","Ji Hoon Seo","Kwanyong Seo","Hana Yoon","Dong-Eon Kim","Young-Jin Kim","Seungchul Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms10685","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T17:50:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1456247138,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2016\/160222\/ncomms10685\/full\/ncomms10685.html"],"pmid":"26898307","pubdate":"2016-02-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"10685","subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Frequency comb transferred by surface plasmon resonance","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequency-comb-transferred-surface-plasmon-resonance-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7252957,"mean":6.3649994636635,"rank":6259668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7252957,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283760,"mean":10.397067321212,"rank":238382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283760,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11018,"mean":40.761315784696,"rank":10551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11018,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":820,"mean":54.968087912088,"rank":783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":820,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
