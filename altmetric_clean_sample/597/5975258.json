This study hypothesized that fasting glycemic status may reflect cerebrovascular risk in non-diabetic Koreans. Fasting glycemic status, lipid profiles, oxidative stress, and inflammation markers were measured in non-diabetic subjects (healthy controls, n = 112 and stroke n = 41). Systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), triglycerides, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CPR), interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were higher, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterols were lower in patients with stroke than healthy controls. Fasting glucose positively correlated with hs-CRP, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) and malondialdehyde. The significances continued or at least turned to a trend after adjustments for confounding factors. Multiple regression analyses revealed that fasting glucose was mainly associated with cerebrovascular risk (\u03b2'-coefficient = 0.284, p < 0.0001) together with age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, hs-CRP, body mass index, dietary poly unsaturated fatty acid\/saturated fatty acid (PUFA\/SFA), and HbA1C (r(2) = 0.634, p = 0.044). The subjects were subdivided by their fasting glucose levels [normal fasting glucose: 70-99 mg\/dL, n = 91 [NFG-control] and n = 27 [NFG-stroke]; higher fasting glucose: 100-125 mg\/dL, n = 21 [HFG-control] and n = 14 [HFG-stroke]). In both controls and stroke patients, HFG groups show higher triglyceride, total- and LDL-cholesterol and lower HDL-cholesterol than NFG groups. Control-HFG group showed significantly higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammation than control-NFG group. Stroke-HFG group also showed significantly higher inflammatory levels than stroke-NFG group, moreover the highest among the groups. Additionally, stroke-NFG group consumed higher PUFA\/SFA than stroke-HFG group. Fasting glucose may be a useful indicator for cerebrovascular risk in non-diabetic individuals which may be mediated by oxidative stress and inflammation status.","authors":["Jae Hyang Lee","So Ra Yoon","Ga Yoon Na","Mira Jun","Mok-Ryeon Ahn","Jae-Kwan Cha","Oh Yoen Kim"],"doi":"10.7762\/cnr.2016.5.1.33","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T18:06:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2287-3732","2287-3740"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1456260247,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4731860\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4731860","pmid":"26839875","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society of Clinical Nutrition","startpage":"33","title":"Fasting Glucose is a Useful Indicator for Cerebrovascular Risk in Non-Diabetic Koreans: Association With Oxidative Stress and Inflammation","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fasting-glucose-useful-indicator-cerebrovascular-risk-nondiabetic-koreans-association-oxidative-stre"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
