We use human muscle activity as feedback to adapt the assistive joint torque behaviour in a way that the muscle activity is minimised. The user can then relax while the exoskeleton takes over the task execution. If the task is altered and the existing assistive behaviour becomes inadequate, the exoskeleton gradually adapts to the new task execution so that the increased muscle activity caused by the new desired task can be reduced. The advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require biomechanical or dynamical models. Our proposed learning system uses Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) as a trajectory generator and parameters of DMPs are modulated using Locally Weighted Regression. Then, the learning system is combined with adaptive oscillators that determine the phase and frequency of motion according to measured Electromyography (EMG) signals. We tested the method with real robot experiments where subjects wearing an elbow exoskeleton had to move an object of an unknown mass according to a predefined reference motion. We further evaluated the proposed approach on a whole-arm exoskeleton to show that it is able to adaptively derive assistive torques even for multiple-joint motion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Luka Peternel","Tomoyuki Noda","Tadej Petri\u010d","Ale\u0161 Ude","Jun Morimoto","Jan Babi\u010d","Peternel, Luka","Noda, Tomoyuki","Petri\u010d, Tadej","Ude, Ale\u0161","Morimoto, Jun","Babi\u010d, Jan"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0148942","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T14:27:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1469707951,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148942","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26881743?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148942.PDF","pmid":"26881743","pubdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0148942","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Adaptive Control of Exoskeleton Robots for Periodic Assistive Behaviours Based on EMG Feedback Minimisation","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-control-exoskeleton-robots-periodic-assistive-behaviours-based-emg-feedback-minimisation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":6193570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1092126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289324,"mean":10.706663362401,"rank":204780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":41916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289324,"percentile":14},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113066,"mean":10.56458557467,"rank":82779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113066,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5451,"mean":12.241540183486,"rank":4233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5451,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
