Thirty-two patients underwent only dietary management (group D) and 23 underwent surgical management (group S). In group S, 17 underwent portacaval shunting (PCS), 13 underwent liver transplantation (LT; 7 underwent both PCS and LT). Height-for-age and body mass index-for-age Z-scores based on World Health Organization data were used to compare growth patterns before and after surgery. Changes in metabolic abnormalities and HCA after operation were also investigated.\nHeight-for-age Z-scores for group S were higher by an average of 0.377 compared to that for group D. Metabolic abnormalities often disappeared after LT but improved partially after PCS. De novo HCA was detected in 4 patients (13%) from group D, 12 (100%) who underwent PCS, and none who underwent LT. One case of hepatocellular carcinoma and one of hemorrhage from a HCA were noted in group D. Two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 of hemorrhage, and 1 of necrosis were noted after PCS.\nSurgery yielded greater growth improvement than dietary management. However, after PCS, metabolic abnormalities remained unresolved, and the de novo HCA rate was high. Portacaval shunting can be used to improve growth in GSD type I patients when LT is not possible, but close observation for metabolic abnormalities and HCA is essential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bed","authors":["Choi, YoungRok","Yi, Nam-Joon","Ko, Jae-Sung","Moon, Jin-Soo","Suh, Suk-Won","Lee, Jeong-Moo","Jeong, Jae-Hong","Kim, Hyeyoung","Lee, Hae-Won","Lee, Kwang-Woong","Suh, Kyung-Suk"],"doi":"10.1097\/tp.0000000000000884","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T12:19:35+00:00","issns":["1534-6080","0041-1337"],"issue":"3","journal":"Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1467892331,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Reappraisal_of_the_Role_of_Portacaval_Shunting_in.24.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26360666?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/2016\/03000\/Reappraisal_of_the_Role_of_Portacaval_Shunting_in.24.pdf","pmid":"26360666","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"585","title":"Reappraisal of the Role of Portacaval Shunting in the Growth of Patients With Glycogen Storage Disease Type I in the Era of Liver Transplantation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Reappraisal_of_the_Role_of_Portacaval_Shunting_in.24.aspx","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reappraisal-role-portacaval-shunting-growth-patients-glycogen-storage-disease-type-i-era-liver-trans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019263,"mean":6.7829620361534,"rank":6940572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019263,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288831,"mean":10.635931170585,"rank":247087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288831,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2946,"mean":2.4662689303905,"rank":2776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2946,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":3.9812323232323,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/751020987546628096","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5973709],"posted_on":"2016-07-07T11:52:11+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"751020987546628096"}]}}
