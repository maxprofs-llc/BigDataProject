Patients' peri-operative details were analysed and compared between groups. Propensity-score matching was performed for risk adjustment.\nPatients receiving TAVI were older (mean age in years TAVI: 83.9\u00b14.6 vs. sAVR: 71\u00b19.9, P<0.001), and were more likely to be female (TAVI: 67%, 43\/64, vs. sAVR: 32%, 217\/669, P <0.001). Unadjusted 30-day mortality was comparable between groups (2\/64, 3% vs. 22\/669, 3%, P >0.99). The matched analysis revealed comparable 30-day mortality (TAVI: 2\/44, 5% vs. sAVR: 2\/44, 5%, P > 0.99). New atrial arrhythmia occurred more frequently within the sAVR cohort (TAVI: 1\/44, 2% vs. sAVR 18\/44, 41%, P <0.001). Complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker was more frequent amongst the TAVI cohort (TAVI: 10\/44, 23% vs. sAVR 2\/44, 5%, P=0.039). At two years, survival was comparable between groups (TAVI: 74\u00b11.7 vs. sAVR: 80\u00b10.1%, P=0.65).\nThis single centre experience suggests that TAVI is a valuable treatment option for high-risk surgical patients with comparable survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029cf","authors":["India Zweng","William Y.
