According to the collaborative review group search strategy, we searched MEDLINE (1996 to 2015.10); EBCO (1996 to 2015.10) and CNKI. A meta-analysis was carried out using RevMan 5.0. We identified 11 reports that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for our review. Controlled trials reporting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure in RDN, and control groups at the 6-month follow-up in patients with resistant hypertension were systematically reviewed. Pooled analysis of all 11 included studies showed significant reductions in SBP (weighted mean difference -13.9\u2009mmHg, 95% confidence interval -21.17 to -6.63, P=0.00025, I=93%) and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -4.41\u2009mmHg, 95% confidence interval -6.95 to -1.88, P=0.004, I=90%) compared with the control group at the 6-month follow-up. Six controlled trials reported specific values of ambulatory SBP that showed no significant difference between two groups. It has also been found that RDN has benefits in protecting cardiac and renal function compared with the control group without increasing adverse events. In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that RDN is superior to the control group in lowering office blood pressure rather than ambulatory SBP, and might have other potential benefits to protect heart and renal function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005780","authors":["Zhang, Xiaojuan","Wu, Nie","Yan, Wenjuan","Zhou, Chunya","Guo, Hua"],"doi":"10.1097\/mbp.0000000000000177","first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T08:23:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1359-5237","1473-5725"],"issue":"4","journal":"Blood pressure monitoring.","last_mentioned_on":1470024025,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/The_effects_of_renal_denervation_on_resistant.99625.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/Abstract\/2016\/08000\/The_effects_of_renal_denervation_on_resistant.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/9000\/00000\/The_effects_of_renal_denervation_on_resistant.99625.pdf","pmid":"26901340","pubdate":"2016-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"1","title":"The effects of renal denervation on resistant hypertension patients:  a meta-analysis.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bpmonitoring\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_effects_of_renal_denervation_on_resistant.99625.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-renal-denervation-resistant-hypertension-patients-metaanalysis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":3631293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4428530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289271,"mean":10.716324900612,"rank":121139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":164091,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289271,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":1.8413274021352,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.85,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
