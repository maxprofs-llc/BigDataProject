The alignment characteristics and sensory status of children through age 5\u00a0years were evaluated.\nIn the IATS study, 91 of 112 children (81%) developed strabismus through age 5\u00a0years. Of 34 infants who were orthotropic at near 12\u00a0months after cataract surgery, at age 5\u00a0years 14 (41%) were orthotropic at distance, and 15 (44%) were orthotropic at near at age 5\u00a0years without strabismus surgery. Eight of 56 children (14%) in the CL group and 13 of 56 (23%) in the IOL group were orthotropic at distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.33) at 5\u00a0years of age and had no history of strabismus surgery. Thirteen of 48 (27%) who underwent cataract surgery prior to 49\u00a0days of age compared to 8 of 64 (13%) who had surgery after 49\u00a0days were orthotropic (P\u00a0=\u00a00.085). Median visual acuity in the operative eye was 0.4 logMAR (20\/50) for children with orthotropia or microtropia (<10(\u0394)) versus 1.10 logMAR (20\/252) for strabismus \u226510(\u0394) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Stereopsis was detected in 12 of 21 children (57%) with orthotropia versus 16 of 89 (18%) children with strabismus (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0006).\nIOL placement does not reduce the development of strabismus after monocular congenital cataract surgery. Improved ocular alignment by age 5\u00a0years correlated strongly with improved visual acuity and stereopsis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b5b","authors":["Erick D. Bothun","Michael J.
