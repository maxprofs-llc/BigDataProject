It was noted that immune-mediated disorders often coexist. There is well-known association between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes and ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. However, growing body of literature suggests the association between coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. This is an extremely rare problem in paediatric gastroenterology. To date there have been reported several cases of children with coexisting coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Herewith we present review of current literature on coexistence of coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease in children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9293cf058f61000dd45","authors":["Krawiec, Paulina","Paw\u0142owska-Kamieniak, Agnieszka","Pac-Ko\u017cuchowska, El\u017cbieta","Mroczkowska-Juchkiewcz, Agnieszka","Kominek, Katarzyna"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-23T08:47:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1426-9686"],"issue":"235","journal":"Polski merkuriusz lekarski organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego","last_mentioned_on":1456216004,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26891438"],"pmid":"26891438","pubdate":"2016-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Coexistence of coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease in children]","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coexistence-coeliac-disease-inflammatory-bowel-disease-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7252957,"mean":6.3649994636635,"rank":3682280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2052587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7252957,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283760,"mean":10.397086703858,"rank":152819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283760,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203,"mean":1.820495049505,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.2333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/arrigoarrighi\/statuses\/702046921767186434","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5972907],"posted_on":"2016-02-23T08:26:44+00:00","author":{"name":"arrigo arrighi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/822585772930977801\/ScphiaPa_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"arrigoarrighi","tweeter_id":"311894267","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":227},"tweet_id":"702046921767186434"}]}}
