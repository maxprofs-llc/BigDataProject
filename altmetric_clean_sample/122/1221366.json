It is believed that it is only possible for the organisations to achieve their goals as long as they adapt to the changes, and they continue the learning process. Based on these ideas, this study aims to determine the perceptions of a learning organisation's applications by the workers at Health Centre in Denizli. In order to achieve this goal, a questionnaire method was used and in the questionnaire, questions inquiring about the examples from learning organisation processes as well as the questions representing socio-demographic characteristics of the workers were included. When the obtained results were analyzed, the health sector workers stated that there were some applications in their organisations intended for knowing, understanding and thinking organisation models which were among the learning organisation phases. The workers also stated that they thought their organisation implemented some applications such as \"Each individual in my organisation has an equal chance to learn (33.3 %)\", \"Knowledge reaches every part of the organisation quickly and effectively (31.3 %)\", \"Our organisation provides the necessary environment for learning (37.5 %)\" etc. Besides, they thought that the process of being a learning organisation was not totally completed. The workers pointed out the main obstacles to be a learning organisation and to organisational learning process as communication problems (46.9 %), factors originating from managers (37.5 %), learning obstacles originating from the individual himself (32.3 %) etc.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e46","authors":["Somuno\u011flu S","Erdem E","Erdem U"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10916-012-9864-9","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T10:22:32+00:00","issns":["0148-5598"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Medical Systems","last_mentioned_on":1360173778,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22695990"],"pmid":"22695990","pubdate":"2012-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"A Study on Determining the Perception of Learning Organisation Applications by Health Sector Workers.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-determining-perception-learning-organisation-applications-health-sector-workers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1873761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2577848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285675,"mean":6.0551412099106,"rank":106750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":174625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285675,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":1.5443448275862,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.57,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
