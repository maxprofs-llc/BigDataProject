The intensity of infection (evidenced by worm burden and liver egg burden) and liver immunopathology (number and size of liver granulomas) were significantly reduced in neonates from infected mothers (I.M.) compared with neonates from noninfected mothers (N.M.). Anti-soluble worm antigen of S. japonicum (SWA) IgG could be detected in sera of neonates from I.M. (N.N.\/I.M.) at 1\u00a0week after delivery, remained a plateau for 2\u00a0weeks and gradually decreased until 8\u00a0weeks of age. Parasite-specific IgM was not detected in sera from N.N.\/I.M. at any time after delivery. At 6\u00a0weeks after infection, the level of anti-SWA IgG in infected neonates from I.M. (I.N.\/I.M.) was significantly higher than that of infected neonates from N.M. (I.N.\/N.M.). In addition, production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and TGF-\u03b2 by cultured splenocytes from I.N.\/I.M. was significantly increased, while the level of IL-4 was significantly decreased when compared to those from I.N.\/N.M.. These data demonstrate that congenital exposure to schistosomiasis japonica may render neonatal mice born to I.M. less susceptible to subsequent challenge and result in down-regulation of both infection intensity and immunopathology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003291","authors":["Zhao, F.","Huang, X.","Hou, X.","Deng, Y.","Wu, M.","Guan, F.","Liu, W.","Li, Y.","Lei, J."],"doi":"10.1111\/pim.12027","endpage":"163","first_seen_on":"2013-02-07T09:05:22+00:00","issns":["1365-3024","0141-9838"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Parasite Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1399728215,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pim.12027\/abstract;jsessionid=4428AD0BA0F54431788FB1F9C875D2AE.d04t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23387533?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pim.12027\/pdf","pmid":"23387533","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"157","subjects":["parasitology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Schistosoma japonicum: susceptibility of neonate mice born to infected and non\u00e2\u0080\u0090infected mothers following subsequent challenge","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/schistosoma-japonicum-susceptibility-neonate-mice-born-infected-noninfected-mothers-following-subseq"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2122903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2225223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285688,"mean":6.0553571846111,"rank":128889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":142680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285688,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":1.9710699588477,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":0.60277777777778,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/worm_papers\/status\/465119961715724288","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1224542],"posted_on":"2014-05-10T13:23:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Helminth papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/442964093498949632\/nwlIaKzr_normal.jpeg","description":"Automated paper feed twitter bot for academics interested in parasitic worms, gut parasites and anthelminthics","id_on_source":"worm_papers","tweeter_id":"2381877092","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":324},"tweet_id":"465119961715724288"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lstmjournals\/statuses\/299443640906944512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1224542],"posted_on":"2013-02-07T09:05:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Donald Mason Library","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"","id_on_source":"lstmjournals","tweeter_id":"109528074","followers":450},"tweet_id":"299443640906944512"}]}}
