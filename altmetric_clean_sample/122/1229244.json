She developed fever and headache, which was empirically treated as malaria. After she had returned to Switzerland, a chest x-ray showed bilateral miliary nodular infiltrates. In assumption of an atypical pneumonia, she was treated with levofloxacin, although without success. On admission, she was in a bad general condition and was markedly dyspneic. Rales were heard over both lungs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070e3","doi":"10.1055\/s-0032-1332870","first_seen_on":"2013-02-09T11:45:56+00:00","issns":["1439-4413"],"issue":"7","journal":"Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift","last_mentioned_on":1360410348,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/PubMed\/23393000?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23393000","pubdate":"2013-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Histoplasmosis - an unusual african souvenir].","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histoplasmosis-unusual-african-souvenir"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3079042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286674,"mean":6.0724524248882,"rank":196392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286674,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":346,"mean":2.1290666666667,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":346,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.3714285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
