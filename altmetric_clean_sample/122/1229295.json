In the present study, repeated NC-induced modulations in working memory, along with concurrently-observed anxiety-related behavioral alterations, were investigated in mice, and compared with the effects of a typical cognition-impairing stressor, immobilization stress (IM). Furthermore, considering the structural and functional contributions of brain cannabinoid (CB) receptors in NC-induced psychiatric symptoms including emotional symptoms, the interactive effects of brain CB receptor ligands (CB ligands) and NC and\/or IM on the working memory- and anxiety-related behaviors were examined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-14-20","first_seen_on":"2013-02-09T12:26:30+00:00","issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1361168005,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/14\/20\/abstract"],"pmid":"23394117","pubdate":"2013-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"20","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Working memory- and anxiety-related behavioral effects of repeated nicotine as a stressor: the role of cannabinoid receptors","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/working-memory-anxietyrelated-behavioral-effects-repeated-nicotine-stressor-role-cannabinoid-recepto"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2007631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2992601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290914,"mean":6.2984202699775,"rank":95916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":192252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290914,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":679,"mean":3.331017699115,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.151,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
