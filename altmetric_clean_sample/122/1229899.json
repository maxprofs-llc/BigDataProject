Lipid-loaded macrophages, termed foam cells, are important during the early development of atherosclerotic plaques. To pursue the hypothesis that ligand-based modulation of the nuclear receptor LXR\u03b1 is crucial for cell homeostasis during atherosclerotic processes, we analysed genome-wide the action of LXR\u03b1 in foam cells and macrophages. By integrating chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and gene expression profile analyses, we generated a highly stringent set of 186 LXR\u03b1 target genes. Treatment with the nanomolar-binding ligand T0901317 and subsequent auto-regulatory LXR\u03b1 activation resulted in sequence-dependent sharpening of the genome-binding patterns of LXR\u03b1. LXR\u03b1-binding loci that correlated with differential gene expression revealed 32 novel target genes with potential beneficial effects, which in part explained the implications of disease-associated genetic variation data. These observations identified highly integrated LXR\u03b1 ligand-dependent transcriptional networks, including the APOE\/C1\/C4\/C2-gene cluster, which contribute to the reversal of cholesterol efflux and the dampening of inflammation processes in foam cells to prevent atherogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkt034","first_seen_on":"2013-02-09T21:50:04+00:00","issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1364405586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23393188?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23393188","pubdate":"2013-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Genome-wide analysis of LXR\u03b1 activation reveals new transcriptional networks in human atherosclerotic foam cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-analysis-lxr-activation-reveals-new-transcriptional-networks-human-atherosclerotic-foam-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2927175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271961,"mean":6.7707939476395,"rank":135198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":104754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271961,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9535,"mean":4.0047287602266,"rank":6662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":2042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9535,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1065,"mean":3.9173308270677,"rank":580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1065,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
