Some of the resulting fragments were shown to be involved in important intra- and extracellular signalling events. Although shedding of the human transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) has been known for > 30 years and soluble TfR1 is an accepted diagnostic marker, the fate of the remaining N-terminal fragment (NTF) remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that TfR1-NTF is subject to regulated intramembrane proteolysis and, using MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, we have identified the cleavage site as being located C-terminal from Gly-84. We showed that the resulting C-terminal peptide is extracellularly released after regulated intramembrane proteolysis and it was detected as a monomer with an internal disulfide bridge. We further identified signal peptide peptidase-like 2a and mainly signal peptide peptidase-like 2b as being responsible for the intramembrane proteolysis of TfR1-NTF.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["Zahn, Claudia","Kaup, Matthias","Fluhrer, Regina","Fuchs, Hendrik"],"doi":"10.1111\/febs.12176","endpage":"1663","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T10:25:31+00:00","issns":["1742-4658","1742-464X"],"issue":"7","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1362143886,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12176\/abstract;jsessionid=018155AEF886ECE360B46E4A8A4BE145.d04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12176\/abstract;jsessionid=991F4A49B82D0AA0456E8B3C221077EC.d03t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12176\/pdf","pmid":"23384347","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1653","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The transferrin receptor\u00e2\u0080\u00901 membrane stub undergoes intramembrane proteolysis by SPPL2b","type":"article","volume":"280","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transferrin-receptor1-membrane-stub-undergoes-intramembrane-proteolysis-signal-peptide-peptidaselike"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6509968,"mean":6.031375281317,"rank":3083859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1945303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6509968,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291955,"mean":6.5450399309479,"rank":144319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":113055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291955,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2004,"mean":1.7574268597104,"rank":676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2004,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":1.2506066350711,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
