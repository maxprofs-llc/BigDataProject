And antibiotic therapy is routinely used for all infected wounds to reduce the mortality of diabetic foot. Here, we report a case of diabetic foot with acute and deep severe infection. During hospital therapy, we used negative pressure therapy and extensive debridement without systemic antibiotic application, and we successfully rescued a foot from amputation. Negative pressure therapy and extensive debridement are very important and effective methods to control infection and promote wound healing in diabetes foot.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5a53cf058f6100052f8","authors":["Xi-Qiao Wang","Ming Tian","Yu-Zhi Jiang","Yi-Wen Niu","Yu-Rui Xiao","Shu-Liang Lu"],"doi":"10.1177\/1534734612458286","endpage":"298","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T03:10:58+00:00","issns":["1552-6941","1534-7346"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds","last_mentioned_on":1360121436,"links":["http:\/\/ijl.sagepub.com\/content\/11\/4\/296.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ijl.sagepub.com\/content\/11\/4\/296.full.pdf","pmid":"23089961","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"296","title":"A Severely Infected Diabetic Foot Treated Successfully Without Using Systemic Antibiotics","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severely-infected-diabetic-foot-treated-successfully-without-using-systemic-antibiotics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":2898539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281160,"mean":5.8318891445766,"rank":224423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281160,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.2311228070175,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.7891428571429,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
