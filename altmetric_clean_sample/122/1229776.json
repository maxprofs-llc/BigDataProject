Biomimetic mushroom-shaped fibrillar adhesive microstructure inspired by these systems was characterized using a variety of measurement techniques and compared with a control flat surface made of the same material. Results revealed that pull-off force and peel strength of the structured specimens are more than twice those of the flat specimens. In contrast to the control system, the structured one is found to be very tolerant to contamination and able to recover its adhesive properties after being washed in a soap solution. Based on the combination of several geometrical principles found in biological attachment devices, the presented microstructure exhibits a considerable step towards the development of an industrial dry adhesive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ee4","authors":["J Tuma"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsif.2006.0164","first_seen_on":"2013-02-09T18:56:03+00:00","issns":["1742-5662"],"journal":"Journal of The Royal Society Interface","last_mentioned_on":1360436158,"links":["http:\/\/rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/4\/13\/271.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/4\/13\/271.full.pdf","pmid":"17251156","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biology","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Biomimetic mushroom-shaped fibrillar adhesive microstructure","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomimetic-mushroomshaped-fibrillar-adhesive-microstructure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2310255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1580715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286675,"mean":6.072525774922,"rank":145914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":102144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286675,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1020,"mean":14.630800785083,"rank":679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1020,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":14.92753030303,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
