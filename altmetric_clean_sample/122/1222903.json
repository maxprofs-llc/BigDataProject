During the cell growth phase, ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing components in the medium are consumed, but at later times as cells begin to die, UV-absorbing molecules such as proteins are released into the medium. Measuring the absorbance at 280nm (A(280)) with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, an inverse correlation between the onset of the cell decline phase and A(280) was observed. This simple method can be applied to quickly determine the beginning of the decline phase of cultures of mammalian and insect cells in suspension.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224b","authors":["Michel PO","Degen C","Hubert M","Baldi L","Hacker DL","Wurm FM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ab.2012.08.028","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T16:02:23+00:00","issns":["0003-2697"],"issue":"","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1360176102,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22960013"],"pmid":"22960013","pubdate":"2012-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A NanoDrop-based method for rapid determination of viability decline in suspension cultures of animal cells.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanodropbased-method-rapid-determination-viability-decline-suspension-cultures-animal-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":1722825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1844125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281160,"mean":5.8319014436671,"rank":118110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":155014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281160,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":2.1603338683788,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
