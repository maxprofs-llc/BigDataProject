Intravitreal injection of saline has been shown potentially to lead to improved visual acuity compared with observation alone in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage. Therefore, it is important to determine if intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor can reduce vitrectomy rates (and risks associated with vitrectomy) compared with saline for vitreous hemorrhage from PDR that precludes placement or confirmation of complete panretinal photocoagulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53bd372b2a83eef6128b456a","authors":[" "],"doi":"10.1001\/jamaophthalmol.2013.2015","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T12:00:37+00:00","issns":["2168-6165"],"issue":"3","journal":"JAMA Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1367452800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23370902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1001\/jamaophthalmol.2013.2015"],"pmid":"23370902","pubdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"283","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Intravitreal Ranibizumab or Saline for Vitreous Hemorrhage From Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-clinical-trial-evaluating-intravitreal-ranibizumab-saline-vitreous-hemorrhage-proliferati-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2496404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289783,"mean":6.2836228682247,"rank":131346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":147880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289783,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1208,"mean":8.572289975145,"rank":833,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1208,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":4.5147393939394,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
