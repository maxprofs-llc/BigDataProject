PTEN is frequently found mutated in many pathological conditions highlighting its importance in normal physiological function. Unlike several cellular proteins which are activated by phosphorylation, PTEN is inactivated upon phosphorylation by specific kinases which phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in its C-terminal region. Therefore, development of therapeutic agents that specifically target kinases and kinase-domain-containing proteins affecting PTEN would lead to the treatment of PTEN-related diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c8","authors":["Chandra S Boosani","Devendra K Agrawal"],"doi":"10.1517\/13543776.2013.768985","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T04:28:39+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1354-3776","1744-7674"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents","last_mentioned_on":1391678623,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543776.2013.768985","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/full\/10.1517\/13543776.2013.768985","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543776.2013.768985?ai=rz&mi=3j7h3l&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1517\/13543776.2013.768985?ai=rz&mi=3jbj3f&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&"],"pmid":"23379765","pubdate":"2013-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","title":"PTEN modulators: a patent review.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pten-modulators-patent-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2670060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289864,"mean":6.2801233065274,"rank":143577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":113678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289864,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":361,"mean":1.4139333333333,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":361,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.29375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
