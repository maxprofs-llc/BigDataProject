GPR81, GPR109A, and GPR109B, formerly known as the nicotinic acid receptor family, are encoded by clustered genes and share a high degree of sequence homology. Recently, hydroxy-carboxylic acids were identified as endogenous ligands of GPR81, GPR109A, and GPR109B, and therefore these receptors have been placed into a novel receptor family of hydroxy-carboxylic acid (HCA) receptors. The HCA(1) receptor (GPR81) is activated by the glycolytic metabolite 2-hydroxy-propionic acid (lactate), the HCA(2) receptor is activated by the ketone body 3-hydroxy-butyric acid, and the HCA(3) receptor (GPR109B) is a receptor for the \u03b2-oxidation intermediate 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid. While HCA(1) and HCA(2) receptors are present in most mammalian species, the HCA(3) receptor is exclusively found in humans and higher primates. HCA receptors are expressed in adipose tissue and mediate anti-lipolytic effects in adipocytes through G(i)-type G protein-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. HCA(2) and HCA(3) inhibit lipolysis during conditions of increased \u03b2-oxidation such as prolonged fasting, whereas HCA(1) mediates the anti-lipolytic effects of insulin in the fed state. As HCA(2) is a receptor for the established anti-dyslipidemic drug nicotinic acid, HCA(1) and HCA(3) also represent promising drug targets and several synthetic ligands for HCA receptors have been developed. In this article, we will summarize the deorphanization and pharmacological characterization of HCA receptors. Moreover, we will discuss recent progress in elucidating the physiological and pathophysiological role to further evaluate the therapeutic potential of the HCA receptor family for the treatment of metabolic disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90c3cf058f61000cae8","authors":["Kashan Ahmed"],"doi":"10.3389\/fendo.2011.00051","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T18:16:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1664-2392"],"journal":"Frontiers in endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1373106531,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3356039\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3356039","pmid":"22654812","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers Media SA","title":"Biological Roles and Therapeutic Potential of Hydroxy-Carboxylic Acid Receptors","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-roles-therapeutic-potential-hydroxycarboxylic-acid-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4509149,"mean":5.2377591184699,"rank":2883055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1456508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4509149,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285682,"mean":6.1274280893725,"rank":173087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":97818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285682,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":2.079307277628,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":1.7665806451613,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
