Our previous studies demonstrated requirement of Rsf-1 for cell survival in cancer cells, which contributed to tumour progression; however, its role in tumourigenesis has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we co-immunoprecipitated proteins with Rsf-1 followed by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and identified cyclin E1, besides SNF2H, as one of the major Rsf-1 interacting proteins. Like RSF1, CCNE1 is frequently amplified in ovarian cancer, and both Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 were found co-up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues. Ectopic expression of Rsf-1 and cyclin E1 in non-tumourigenic TP53(mut) RK3E cells led to an increase in cellular proliferation and tumour formation by activating cyclin E1-associated kinase (CDK2). Tumourigenesis was not detected if either cyclin E1 or Rsf-1 was expressed, or they were expressed in a TP53(wt) background. Domain mapping showed that cyclin E1 interacted with the first 441 amino acids of Rsf-1. Ectopic expression of this truncated domain significantly suppressed G1\/S-phase transition, cellular proliferation, and tumour formation of RK3E-p53(R175H) \/Rsf-1\/cyclin E1 cells. The above findings suggest that Rsf-1 interacts and collaborates with cyclin E1 in neoplastic transformation and TP53 mutations are a prerequisite for tumour-promoting functions of the RSF\/cyclin E1 complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Sheu JJ","Choi JH","Guan B","Tsai FJ","Hua CH","Lai MT","Wang TL","Shih IM","Sheu, Jim Jinn\u2010Chyuan","Choi, Jung Hye","Guan, Bin","Tsai, Fuu\u2010Jen","Hua, Chun\u2010Hung","Lai, Ming\u2010Tsung","Wang, Tian\u2010Li","Shih, Ie\u2010Ming","Jim Jinn-Chyuan Sheu","Jung Hye Choi","Bin Guan","Fuu-Jen Tsai","Chun-Hung Hua","Ming-Tsung Lai","Tian-Li Wang","Ie-Ming Shih"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4147","endpage":"568","first_seen_on":"2013-02-06T14:09:38+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1096-9896","0022-3417","00223417"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1360159757,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4147\/abstract;jsessionid=2A7071B5030D18BD78AC6B510972AEC6.d02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4147\/pdf","pmid":"23378270","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"559","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Rsf\u00e2\u0080\u00901, a chromatin remodelling protein, interacts with cyclin E1 and promotes tumour development","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/path.4147","volume":"229","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rsf1-chromatin-remodelling-protein-interacts-cyclin-e1-promotes-tumour-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6509611,"mean":6.0311100496021,"rank":3083613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1945287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6509611,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291901,"mean":6.5452796505652,"rank":144255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":113067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291901,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":981,"mean":3.2899448979592,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":981,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":2.7013655172414,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
