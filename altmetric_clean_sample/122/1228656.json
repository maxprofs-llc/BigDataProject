Significant damage to DNA was observed for crotoxin and crotapotin (CA). Basic phospholipase A(2) (CB) and crotamine did not present any mutagenic potential when evaluated by the micronucleus test. C. d. terrificus crude venom was able to induce the formation of micronuclei, similarly to the mutagenic drug used as a positive control. In the comet assay, all the toxins tested (crotamine, crotoxin, CB and CA) and C. d. terrificus venom presented genotoxic activity. Studies on the cytogenetic toxicology of animal venoms and their isolated proteins are still very scarce in the literature, which emphasizes the importance of the present work for the identification and characterization of potential therapeutic agents, as well as for the better understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxins on the human body.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000821b","authors":["Marcussi S","Santos PR","Menaldo DL","Silveira LB","Santos-Filho NA","Mazzi MV","da Silva SL","St\u00e1beli RG","Antunes LM","Soares AM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mrgentox.2011.06.004","first_seen_on":"2013-02-09T01:06:49+00:00","issns":["0027-5107"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Mutation Research\/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis","last_mentioned_on":1360371994,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21723956"],"pmid":"21723956","pubdate":"2011-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Evaluation of the genotoxicity of Crotalus durissus terrificus snake venom and its isolated toxins on human lymphocytes.","type":"article","volume":"724","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-genotoxicity-crotalus-durissus-terrificus-snake-venom-isolated-toxins-human-lymphocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2901406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282041,"mean":5.8597576513968,"rank":225472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282041,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":610,"mean":3.0603743842365,"rank":476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":610,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":22.644,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
