Dental focus revolved around preventive and restorative considerations while the anthropological focus was a biological understanding related to human evolution, diet, environment, form, and function and included all the craniofacial structures. Introducing the anthropological perspective into modern dentistry gives an insight into the \"bigger picture\" of the nature and extent of tooth wear. By combining anthropological evidence with clinical knowledge and experience, it is most likely to provide the best-informed and biologically based approach to the management of tooth wear in modern societies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f53","authors":["Townsend, Grant C.","John A.
