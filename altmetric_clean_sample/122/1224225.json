In India, stigma has been cited as a barrier to NGO participation in HIV-prevention activities with high-risk populations. Our study undertook to characterize and contextualize HIV-related stigma within HIV NGOs in Delhi, India. We investigated psychometric characteristics and correlates of HIV-related stigma in a sample of youth NGO practitioners (N=122) working on peer HIV prevention. Factor analyses revealed a \"cultural inflection\" of stigma in this population: assignment of blame on people living with HIV (PLWH) factored along with individual behaviors and care-taking (Dharma, or Duty), distinct from the perception of HIV as God's punishment, which was connected to ostracism from society (Karma, or Destiny). Exposure to HIV-related messages in newspapers was associated with 55.7% lower levels of Dharma-related stigma (p=0.07) and 58% lower levels of Karma-related stigma scores (p=0.01), respectively, while recall of HIV-related messages on the radio was associated with 57.3% lower Dharma-related (p=0.03) and 34.1% lower Karma-related stigma scores (p=0.06), respectively. The strongest correlate of lower HIV-related stigma was social proximity to PLWH (~76% reduction on both stigma factors, p<0.03). Future research on HIV-related stigma should consider the unique cultural properties and correlates of stigma among young NGO practitioners.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Nambiar D","Rimal RN"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2011.648597","first_seen_on":"2013-02-07T03:41:00+00:00","issns":["0954-0121"],"issue":"","journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1361622704,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22292453"],"pmid":"22292453","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Duty and destiny: Psychometric properties and correlates of HIV-related stigma among youth NGO workers in Delhi, India.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/duty-destiny-psychometric-properties-correlates-hivrelated-stigma-among-youth-ngo-workers-delhi-indi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":2647541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2366427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289876,"mean":6.2812062509701,"rank":141844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":146310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289876,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":2.6050332187858,"rank":524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.9589285714286,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
