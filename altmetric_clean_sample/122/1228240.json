In this approach, the use of isocyanide is circumvented, known competing reactions are virtually eliminated, pure products are obtained by a non-chromatographic method, and therapeutically relevant and diverse N-fused 3-aminoimidazoles can be prepared from a wide variety of aldehydes and heterocyclic amidines. This reaction coupling with cascade cyclization provides various privileged tetracyclic heteroaromatic scaffolds.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Guchhait SK","Chaudhary V","Madaan C"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2ob26733k","first_seen_on":"2013-02-08T20:19:40+00:00","issns":["1477-0520","1477-0539"],"issue":"46","journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1360022400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23104509","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/c2ob26733k"],"pmid":"23104509","pubdate":"2012-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"A chemoselective Ugi-type reaction in water using TMSCN as a functional isonitrile equivalent: generation of heteroaromatic molecular diversity","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chemoselective-ugitype-reaction-water-using-tmscn-functional-isonitrile-equivalent-generation-hetero"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":2015408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":924674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281362,"mean":5.8776054890339,"rank":151347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":79055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281362,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":995,"mean":3.148,"rank":522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":995,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181,"mean":4.5158111111111,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
