The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal relations of tuna and dark fish, \u03b1-linolenic acid, and marine omega-3 fatty acid intake with incident major cardiovascular disease in women.\nThis was a prospective cohort study of U.S. women participating in the Women's Health Study from 1993 to 2014, during which the data were collected and analyzed. A total of 39,876 women who were aged \u226545 years and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline provided dietary data on food frequency questionnaires. Analyses used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the association between fish and energy-adjusted omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and the risk of major cardiovascular disease, defined as a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, in 38,392 women in the final analytic sample (96%).\nDuring 713,559 person years of follow-up, 1,941 cases of incident major cardiovascular disease were confirmed. Tuna and dark fish intake was not associated with the risk of incident major cardiovascular disease (p-trend >0.05). Neither \u03b1-linolenic acid nor marine omega-3 fatty acid intake was associated with major cardiovascular disease or with individual cardiovascular outcomes (all p-trend >0.05). There was no effect modification by age, BMI, or baseline history of hypertension.\nIn this cohort of women without history of cardiovascular disease, intakes of tuna and dark fish, \u03b1-linolenic acid, and marine omega-3 fatty acids were not associated with risk of major cardiovascular disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["Rhee, Jinnie J","Kim, Eunjung","Buring, Julie E","Kurth, Tobias"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amepre.2016.07.020","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T20:40:04+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["1873-2607","07493797"],"journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1475893030,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajpmonline.org\/article\/S0749-3797(16)30291-4\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27646568\/?from=women+health+study+fish&i=8"],"pmid":"27646568","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Fish Consumption, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fish-consumption-omega3-fatty-acids-risk-cardiovascular-disease-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":3320853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4112083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239845,"mean":12.490556786911,"rank":106832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239845,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2519,"mean":21.008007148531,"rank":2014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2519,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":83.748705882353,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
