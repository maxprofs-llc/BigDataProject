Laparoscopic evaluation was performed in dorsal recumbency under subarachnoid lumbosacral anesthesia and sedation. An open insertion technique with short 60 mm cannulas was used after creating 2 portals 10 cm cranial to the umbilicus (one 5 cm left of midline for the laparoscope and one 5 cm right of midline as an instrument portal). After laparoscopy, abnormal tissues were resected by laparotomy during the same anesthetic period.\nLaparoscopic evaluation of umbilical structures was performed quickly (mean surgery time 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5 minutes). Umbilical structures could be completely visualized in all calves without intraoperative complications. In addition to abnormalities previously detected on ultrasound, laparoscopy enabled detection of adhesions 7 calves that were not suspected on ultrasound, as well as focal enlargements of the umbilical arteries and urachus close to the bladder in 5 calves. Laparoscopy failed to detect abnormalities observed with ultrasound or laparotomy in 4 calves, including small hernias and omphalitis.\nLaparoscopic evaluation of umbilical structures was performed safely and quickly in young calves and allowed complete evaluation of intra-abdominal umbilical structures and may, therefore, be a useful adjunct to physical examination and ultrasound to fully assess the abdomen in calves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c73","authors":["Robert, Micka\u00ebl","Touzot\u2010Jourde, Gwenola","Nikolayenkova\u2010Topie, Olga","Cesbron, Nora","Fellah, Borhane","Tessier, Caroline","Gauthier, Olivier"],"doi":"10.1111\/vsu.12559","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T19:16:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-950X"],"issue":"8","journal":"Veterinary Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1475176554,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vsu.12559\/abstract;jsessionid=1F06975F139DA7858BA9A6D8C92AA65B.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vsu.12559\/pdf","pmid":"27685954","pubdate":"2016-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Laparoscopic Evaluation of Umbilical Disorders in Calves","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laparoscopic-evaluation-umbilical-disorders-calves"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252967,"mean":12.751406679158,"rank":207360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252967,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":1.0860868263473,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":0.80714285714286,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":3,"Student  > Ph.
