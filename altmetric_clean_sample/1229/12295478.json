In the present study, TMP and\/or ASG-IV were administrated to rats for 14 days after MI. Echocardiography revealed that the left ventricular (LV) dimensions and cardiac function was preserved in the MI rats with TMP and ASG-IV treatment, compared to untreated MI rats. Moreover, the LV dimensions and cardiac function in the MI rats with TMP and ASG-IV co-treatment were comparable to the sham-operated rats. In addition, TMP and ASG-IV synergistically inhibited LV fibrosis by attenuating MI-induced collagen deposition and elevation of transforming growth factor \u03b21. TMP and ASG-IV, alone or in synergy, enhanced angiogenesis in the infarcted myocardium and reduced cardiac hypertrophy of the remote myocardium following MI. Furthermore, TMP and ASG-IV mutually upregulated the expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smmothened (Smo) and Glioblastoma-2 (Gli2), the receptor and signal transducer of Shh signaling pathway, in the infarcted myocardium. In summary, in the circumstance of the irreversible ischemic injury, the anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic properties of TMP and ASG-IV on the non-affected tissues contributes to the cardio-protection in the healing phase post MI, and the cardio-protective effects are likely to be mediated via the Shh pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","authors":["Wang, Chuying","Li, Yumei","Yang, Xinxin","Bi, Shengnan","Zhang, Yajie","Han, Dong","Zhang, Dafang"],"doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0000000000000437","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T20:29:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4023","0160-2446"],"journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1475180943,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Tetramethylpyrazine_and_astragaloside_IV.98760.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/9000\/00000\/Tetramethylpyrazine_and_astragaloside_IV.98760.pdf","pmid":"27676326","pubdate":"2016-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"Tetramethylpyrazine and astragaloside IV synergistically ameliorate left ventricular remodeling and preserve cardiac function in a rat myocardial infarction model","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Tetramethylpyrazine_and_astragaloside_IV.98760.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tetramethylpyrazine-astragaloside-iv-synergistically-ameliorate-left-ventricular-remodeling-preserve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":6412514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252967,"mean":12.751392052686,"rank":176753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252967,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1182,"mean":2.0826909398815,"rank":451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1182,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JofCVPonline\/statuses\/781591644554440705","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12295478],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T20:29:03+00:00","author":{"name":"JofCVPharmacology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1611389347\/JCVPharma_Cover_-_Twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief: Michael R.
