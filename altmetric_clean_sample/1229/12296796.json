Anonymised individual-patient data were collected using a standard protocol and modified HIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol.\nOf 229 patients included, 142 (62%) had vertically-acquired infection. Median age at last follow-up was 16.2 years. Most children had HCV genotype 1\u200a(101\/184, 55%) or 3\u200a(57\/184, 31%). One-fifth (46\/214) had a previous AIDS diagnosis (data missing on prior AIDS diagnoses for 15). At their last clinic visit, 70% (145\/208) had no\/mild immunosuppression (CDC stage 1) and 131 of 179 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) had undetectable HIV RNA (assay thresholds varied from\u200a<\u200a20 to\u200a<\u200a150\u200acopies\/ml). Overall 42% (86\/204) had hepatomegaly in the previous year and 55% (116\/213) had ALT\u200a>\u200a40\u200aIU\/L at their last test. Of 97 patients with transient elastography, 12 had results\u200a>\u200a9 kPa; this was associated with duration of HCV infection (p\u200a=\u200a0.033), but not with CD4 count, ART use or gender in univariable analysis. Of 17 subjects with liver biopsies, 6 had bridging fibrosis and one cirrhosis. Twenty-five (11%) had been treated successfully for HCV.\nThe high proportion of patients with progressive liver disease underscores the need for close monitoring and earlier and more effective HCV treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Thorne, Claire","Turkova, Anna","Indolfi, Giuseppe","Venturini, Elisabetta","Giaquinto, Carlo",", ","The European Paediatric HIVHCV Co-infection Study Group in the European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) in EuroCoord"],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000001285","endpage":"135","first_seen_on":"2016-09-29T22:16:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1473-5571","0269-9370"],"issue":"1","journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1504098185,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27677164","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Co_infection_with_HIV_and_HCV_in_229_children_and.97666.aspx","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27898593"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/9000\/00000\/Co_infection_with_HIV_and_HCV_in_229_children_and.97666.pdf","pmid":"27677164","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Co-infection with HIV and HCV in 229 children and young adults living in Europe","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Co_infection_with_HIV_and_HCV_in_229_children_and.97666.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coinfection-hiv-hepatitis-c-virus-229-children-young-adults-living-europe-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.35,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":773967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7674871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252967,"mean":12.751149332321,"rank":36412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":216428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252967,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635,"mean":4.9364991744634,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":7.0825757575758,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hivguidelines\/statuses\/781618682204155904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12296796],"posted_on":"2016-09-29T22:16:30+00:00","author":{"name":"hivguidelines.org","url":"http:\/\/www.hivguidelines.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/823917288478900226\/8JWYALjT_normal.jpg","description":"NYSDOH AI HIV Clinical Guidelines Program.
