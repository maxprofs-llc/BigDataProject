Especially, persistent auditory hallucinations, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are difficult to treat symptoms. Several non-invasive brain stimulation techniques are increasingly being considered as new therapeutic add on options for the management of schizophrenia, targeting these symptom domains. The technique which has been available for the longest time and that is best established in clinical care is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). New stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allow a more pathophysiological-based approach. This review article introduces various non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and discusses recent treatment studies on schizophrenia. In total, the novel brain stimulation techniques discussed here can be considered relevant add on therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia. In this context, the best evidence is available for the application of rTMS for the treatment of negative symptoms and persistent auditory hallucinations; however, negative studies have also been published for both indications. Studies using other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques showed promising results but further research is needed to establish the clinical efficacy. Based on a growing pathophysiological knowledge, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques provide new treatment perspectives for patients with schizophrenia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003184","authors":["PD Dr. A.
