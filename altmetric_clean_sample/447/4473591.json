Targeted therapy could then entail possible overtreatment. We aimed to determine the flare prevalence in patients who are treated-to-target and to evaluate associations between flares and patient-reported outcomes and radiographic progression.\nIn the BeSt study, 508 patients were treated-to-target for 10 years. After initial treatment adjustments to achieve disease activity score \u22642.4, a flare was defined from the second year of follow-up onwards, according to three definitions. The first definition is a disease activity score >2.4 with an increase of \u22650.6 regardless of the previous disease activity score. The other definitions will be described in the manuscript.\nThe flare prevalence was 4-11 % per visit; 67 % of the patients experienced \u22651 flare during 9 years of treatment (median 0 per patient per year). During a flare, functional ability decreased with a mean difference of 0.25 in health assessment questionnaire (p < 0.001), and the odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for an increase in patients' assessment of disease activity, pain and morning stiffness of \u226520 mm on a visual analogue scale were 8.5 (7.3-9.8), 8.4 (7.2-9.7) and 5.6 (4.8-6.6), respectively, compared to the absence of a flare. The odds ratio for radiographic progression was 1.7 (1.1-2.8) in a year with a flare compared to a year without a flare. The more flares a patient experienced, the higher the health assessment questionnaire at year 10 (p < 0.001) and the more radiographic progression from baseline to year 10 (p = 0.005).\nFlares were associated with concurrent increase in patient's assessment of disease activity, pain and morning stiffness, functional deterioration and development of radiographic progression with a dose-response-effect, both during the flare and long term. This suggests that intensifying treatment during a flare outweighs the risk of possible overtreatment.\nDutch trial registry NTR262 (7 September 2005) and NTR265 (8 September 2005).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","authors":["Markusse, Iris M","Dirven, Linda","Gerards, Andreas H","van Groenendael, Johannes H L M","Ronday, H Karel","Kerstens, Pit J S M","Lems, Willem F","Huizinga, Tom W J","Allaart, Cornelia F","Iris M.
