Plasma-polymerized acrylic acid to have carboxyl group was deposited on CP-Ti surface and then ion-exchanged with Ag+ ions in 0.1 N AgNO3. In anti-adherent experiment, antibacterial activity was tested using broth culture methods. The biofilm formation assay was performed using semi-defined biofilm medium with sucrose. The silver coated CP-Ti completely inhibited the growth of S. mutans and S. sobrinus. In addition, the biofilm formation was significantly inhibited in silver-coated CP-Ti group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d84","authors":["Ko, Yeong-Mu","Myung, Sung-Woon","Kook, Joong-Ki","Jung, Sang-Chul","Kim, Byung-Hoon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T10:10:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-4880"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1441361439,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26328382?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26328382","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Nano Silver Ion Substituted Poly Acrylic Acid Films on Titanium by Plasma Polymerization.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-antibacterial-activity-nano-silver-ion-substituted-poly-acrylic-acid-films-titanium-plasma-pol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6251511,"mean":5.8319631004321,"rank":5317953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6251511,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194434,"mean":9.5594140397975,"rank":155752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194434,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":380,"mean":1.0737889182058,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":380,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.07,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/biofilmPapers\/statuses\/639742362038616064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4471920],"posted_on":"2015-09-04T10:10:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Biofilm Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585213267288653824\/evf5BSKg_normal.jpg","description":"Stay on top of all the latest publications on Biofilm research curated from PubMed. #biofilm #microbiology #antibioticresistance.
