The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and immunogenicity of combinations of such an immunomodulatory chemotherapeutic agent with immunotherapy, p53 synthetic long peptide (SLP) vaccine and Pegintron (IFN-\u03b1) in patients with platinum-resistant p53-positive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).\nThis is a phase 1\/2 trial in which patients sequential 6 cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg\/kg2 iv; n = 3), gemcitabine with Pegintron before and after the first gemcitabine cycle (Pegintron 1 \u03bcg\/kg sc; n = 6), and gemcitabine and Pegintron combined with p53 SLP vaccine (0.3 mg\/peptide, 9 peptides; n = 6). At baseline, 22 days after the 2nd and 6th cycle, blood was collected for immunomonitoring. Toxicity, CA-125, and radiologic response were evaluated after 3 and 6 cycles of chemotherapy.\nNone of the patients enrolled experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Predominant grade 3\/4 toxicities were nausea\/vomiting and dyspnea. Grade 1\/2 toxicities consisted of fatigue (78%) and Pegintron-related flu-like symptoms (72%). Gemcitabine reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells (p = 0.0005) and increased immune-supportive M1 macrophages (p = 0.04). Combination of gemcitabine and Pegintron stimulated higher frequencies of circulating proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells but not regulatory T-cells. All vaccinated patients showed strong vaccine-induced p53-specific T-cell responses.\nCombination of gemcitabine, the immune modulator Pegintron and therapeutic peptide vaccination is a viable approach in the development of combined chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens to treat cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Dijkgraaf, Eveline M","Santegoets, Saskia J A M","Reyners, An K L","Goedemans, Renske","Nijman, Hans W","van Poelgeest, Mari\u00ebtte I E","van Erkel, Arien R","Smit, Vincent T H B M","Daemen, Toos A H H","van der Hoeven, Jacobus J M","Melief, Cornelis J M","Welters, Marij J P","Kroep, Judith R","van der Burg, Sjoerd H"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.4772","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T10:26:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"31","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1470821068,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26334096?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4741673","pmid":"26334096","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:00:59+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A phase 1\/2 study combining gemcitabine, Pegintron and p53 SLP vaccine in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/4772","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-12-study-combining-gemcitabine-pegintron-p53-slp-vaccine-patients-platinumresistant-ovarian-ca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8192854,"mean":6.9262032168704,"rank":3295431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4872326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8192854,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232121,"mean":9.1402974065139,"rank":76521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":154413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232121,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8752,"mean":3.1423492172323,"rank":1092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8752,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":604,"mean":1.4903482587065,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":604,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Immunology and Microbiology":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"IR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumImmTx_papers\/statuses\/639746127345020930","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4472188],"posted_on":"2015-09-04T10:25:37+00:00","author":{"name":"TumImmTxpapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"TumImmTx_papers","tweeter_id":"2881001471","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":15},"tweet_id":"639746127345020930"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TumorImm_papers\/statuses\/639768136149893120","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4472188],"posted_on":"2015-09-04T11:53:04+00:00","author":{"name":"TumorImmunoPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/741322452093931520\/rQvFtFTA_normal.jpg","description":"A TwitterBot for Cancer Immunology and Tolerance papers on #PubMed.
