Mismatch of the probe is an especially critical issue in the case of high magnetic fields, polar or ionic solvents, or extreme thermal conditions. Careful tuning is particularly important for quantitative NMR measurements. Manual tuning and matching of the NMR probe is not possible in the case of automated or remotely controlled measurements. Spectrometer manufacturers offer modern probes equipped with automatic tuning\/matching mechanics, like Bruker ATM\u2122, suitable for these experiments. The disadvantages of probes with built-in ATM\u2122 are the significantly higher price, and the non-detachable and non-portable construction. Computer controlled tuning and matching is highly desirrable in solid state NMR since no industrial solution has been developed yet for MAS NMR probes. We present an alternative solution for computer controlled tuning and matching of existing Bruker probes. Building costs are significantly lower, since only commercially available components and ICs are used.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","authors":["Koczor, B\u00e1lint","Sedy\u00f3, Inez","Rohonczy, J\u00e1nos"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2015.08.017","first_seen_on":"2015-09-06T10:07:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10907807","1096-0856"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1441676731,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1090780715001913&_version=1&md5=7332de74f7494eb3a8296d47256d7770","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780715001913"],"pmid":"26363581","pubdate":"2015-09-14T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"An Alternative Solution for Computer Controlled Tuning and Matching of Existing NMR Probes ","type":"article","volume":"259","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-solution-computer-controlled-tuning-matching-existing-nmr-probes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311299,"mean":5.820165748155,"rank":2203465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4072624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311299,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195213,"mean":9.6282644714464,"rank":69699,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":123796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195213,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":470,"mean":1.4388528784648,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":470,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5431034482759,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
