In the present study, the role of miR\u201134a in colon cancer cell proliferation and metastasis was investigated. It was found that the expression of miR\u201134a in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was lower when compared with that of normal tissues and cells. Further research demonstrated that miR\u201134a inhibited cell proliferation, induced G1 phase arrest, and suppressed metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells. Bioinformatic prediction indicated that platelet\u2011derived growth factor receptor\u00a0\u03b1 (PDGFRA) was a potential target gene of miR\u201134a and a luciferase assay identified that PDGFRA was a novel direct target gene of miR\u201134a. In addition, assays of western blot analyses and quantitative reverse\u2011transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that miR\u201134a decreased PDGFRA mRNA expression and protein levels in colon cancer cells. Assessment of cellular function indicated that miR\u201134a inhibited colon cancer progression via PDGFRA. These findings demonstrate that miR\u201134a may act as a negative regulator in colon cancer by targeting PDGFRA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Li, Chunyan","Wang, Yulin","Lu, Shuming","Zhang, Zhuqing","Meng, Hua","Liang, Lina","Zhang, Yan","Song, Bo"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2015.4263","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T10:09:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1441361313,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26324236?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3892\/mmr.2015.4263"],"pmid":"26324236","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"miR\u201134a inhibits colon cancer proliferation and metastasis by inhibiting platelet\u2011derived growth factor receptor\u00a0\u03b1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir34a-inhibits-colon-cancer-proliferation-metastasis-inhibiting-plateletderived-growth-factor-recep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6251511,"mean":5.8319631004321,"rank":4605245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":933649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6251511,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194434,"mean":9.5594140397976,"rank":133988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194434,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1644,"mean":1.0872513694461,"rank":590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1644,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":1.0622269503546,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
