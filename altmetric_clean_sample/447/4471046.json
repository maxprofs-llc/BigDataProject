Called WHAT IF, it provides an intelligent and flexible environment for displaying, manipulating, and analyzing small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and their interactions. A relational protein structure database is incorporated to be queried. The program is suitable for most common crystallographic work. The menu-driven operation of WHAT IF, combined with the use of default values wherever user input is required, makes it very easy to use for a novice user while keeping full flexibility for more sophisticated studies. Although there are not too many unique features in WHAT IF, the fact that everything is integrated in one program makes it a unique tool for many purposes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d6e","authors":["Vriend, G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T05:24:04+00:00","issns":["0263-7855"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Molecular Graphics","last_mentioned_on":1503321870,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2268628","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2268628"],"pmid":"2268628","pubdate":"1990-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"WHAT IF: a molecular modeling and drug design program.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-modeling-drug-design-program"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":2159283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5101432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233282,"mean":9.1845991486662,"rank":68963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":160198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233282,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.713625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
