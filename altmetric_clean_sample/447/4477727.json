This review summarizes the current data on this possible role of PCSK9. A link between PCSK9 and TRL has been suggested through the demonstration of (1) a correlation between plasma PCSK9 and triglyceride (TG) levels in health and disease, (2) a correlation between plasma PCSK9 and markers of carbohydrate metabolism, which is closely related to TG metabolism, (3) an effect of TG-lowering fibrate therapy on plasma PCSK9 levels, (4) an effect of PCSK9 on postprandial lipemia, (5) an effect of PCSK9 on adipose tissue biology, (6) an effect of PCSK9 on apolipoprotein B production from the liver and intestines, (7) an effect of PCSK9 on receptors other than low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) that are involved in TRL metabolism, and (8) an effect of anti-PCSK9 therapy on serum TG levels. The underlying mechanisms are unclear but starting to emerge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007b9b","authors":["Druce, I","Abujrad, H","Ooi, T C","Irena Druce","Hussein Abujrad","Teik Chye Ooi"],"doi":"10.7555\/jbr.29.20150052","endpage":"436","first_seen_on":"2015-09-06T00:43:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1674-8301","16748301"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Biomedical Research","last_mentioned_on":1484536769,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26320603?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4662203\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4662203\/"],"pmid":"26320603","pubdate":"2015-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Education Department of Jiangsu Province","startpage":"429","title":"PCSK9 and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pcsk9-triglyceriderich-lipoprotein-metabolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076187,"mean":6.8570931149856,"rank":3330030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4702584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076187,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231956,"mean":9.1832130801231,"rank":80258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":149844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231956,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":1.4268333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
