This gene encodes a postsynaptic 78-amino acid protein kinase substrate that binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium, and that has been implicated in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity. In the rat brain RC3 is under thyroid hormone control in specific neuronal subsets in both developing and adult animals. To evaluate whether the human gene is also a target of thyroid hormone we have searched for T3-responsive elements in NRGN cloned genomic fragments spanning the whole gene. Labeled DNA fragments were incubated with T3 receptors (T3R) and 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors and immunoprecipitated using an anti T3R antibody. A receptor-binding site was localized in the first intron, 3000 bp downstream from the origin of transcription. Footprinting analysis revealed the sequence GGATTAAATGAGGTAA, closely related to the consensus T3-responsive element of the direct repeat (DR4) type. This sequence binds the T3R-9-cis-retinoic acid receptors heterodimers, but not T3R monomers or homodimers, and is able to confer regulation by T3R and T3 when fused upstream of the NRGN or thymidine kinase promoters. The data reported in this work suggest that NRGN is a direct target of thyroid hormone in human brain, and that control of expression of this gene could underlay many of the consequences ofhypothyroidism on mental states during development as well as in adult subjects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","authors":["Mart\u00ednez de Arrieta, C","Morte, B","Coloma, A","Bernal, J"],"doi":"10.1210\/endo.140.1.6461","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T19:49:09+00:00","issns":["0013-7227","1945-7170"],"issue":"1","journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1439387822,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9886843"],"pmid":"9886843","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"The human RC3 gene homolog, NRGN contains a thyroid hormone-responsive element located in the first intron.","type":"article","volume":"140","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-rc3-gene-homolog-nrgn-contains-thyroid-hormoneresponsive-element-located-first-intron"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5476581,"mean":6.3617485737435,"rank":1385640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3466591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5476581,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193260,"mean":9.5365293621512,"rank":59603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":131407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193260,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2372,"mean":3.7634036271615,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2372,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":8.02532,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
