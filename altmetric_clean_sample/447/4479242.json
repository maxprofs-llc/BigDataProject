This study was undertaken to translate into German, validate and test the reliability of the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS).\nRandomly selected women after childbirth (n = 110) underwent (on the fourth postpartum day) a semistructured interview after first having answered the translated EPDS questionnaire. The diagnosis of depressive disorder was made according to the the criteria for psychological disorders in the ICD-10. For validation the results of the EPDS were compared with the clinical diagnosis of depression. The calculation of sensitivity, specificity and positive prognostic value was related to the respective EPDS results. In addition the EPDS data were analyses as to their reliability.\nThe average age of the tested women was 28.6 years; 72% were married and 45% were primiparae. For an EPDS total score threshold value of 9.5 the sensitivity was 0.96, the specificity 1.0, and a positive prognostic value of 1.0. In the reliability analysis for EPDS the Guttmann split-half reliability was 0.82 and the alpha-coefficient 0.81.\nThe German version of the EPDS with ten questions is an \"application friendly\" as well as proven to be a valid and reliable method for supporting the diagnosis of postpartum depressive disorder. It is suitable for both clinical and research use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070e3","authors":["A. M. Bergant","T. Nguyen","K. Heim","H. Ulmer","O.
