In the latter, ROS were shown to modulate diverse physiological processes including the regulation of growth factor signaling, the hypoxic response, inflammation and the immune response. During the last 60-100 years the life style, at least in the Western world, has changed enormously. This became obvious with an increase in caloric intake, decreased energy expenditure as well as the appearance of alcoholism and smoking; These changes were shown to contribute to generation of ROS which are, at least in part, associated with the occurrence of several chronic diseases like adiposity, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and cancer. In this review we discuss aspects and problems on the role of intracellular ROS formation and nutrition with the link to diseases and their problematic therapeutical issues.","altmetric_jid":"5216115a3cf058827c000018","authors":["G\u00f6rlach, Agnes","Dimova, Elitsa Y","Petry, Andreas","Mart\u00ednez-Ruiz, Antonio","Hernansanz-Agust\u00edn, Pablo","Rolo, Anabela P","Palmeira, Carlos M","Kietzmann, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.redox.2015.08.016","first_seen_on":"2015-09-05T15:04:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2213-2317","22132317"],"journal":"Redox Biology","last_mentioned_on":1443777309,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26339717?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2213231715001068"],"pmid":"26339717","pubdate":"2015-09-05T22:00:27+00:00","title":"Reactive oxygen species, nutrition, hypoxia and diseases: Problems solved?
