Our goal was to investigate whether the repair of 8-oxoG DNA damage follow a circadian rhythm. In a group of 15 healthy volunteers, we found a daily variation of Ogg1 expression and activity with higher levels in the morning compared to the evening hours. Consistent with this, we also found lower levels of 8-oxoG in morning hours compared to those in the evening hours. Lymphocytes exposed to oxidative damage to DNA at 8:00 AM display lower accumulation of 8-oxoG than lymphocytes exposed at 8:00 PM. Furthermore, altered levels of Ogg1 expression were also observed in a group of shift workers experiencing a deregulation of circadian clock genes compared to a control group. Moreover, BMAL1 knockdown fibroblasts with a deregulated molecular clock showed an abolishment of circadian variation of Ogg1 expression and an increase of OGG1 activity. Our results suggest that the circadian modulation of 8-oxoG DNA damage repair, according to a variation of Ogg1 expression, could render humans less susceptible to accumulate 8-oxoG DNA damage in the morning hours.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Manzella, Nicola","Bracci, Massimo","Strafella, Elisabetta","Staffolani, Sara","Ciarapica, Veronica","Copertaro, Alfredo","Rapisarda, Venerando","Ledda, Caterina","Amati, Monica","Valentino, Matteo","Tomasetti, Marco","Stevens, Richard G","Santarelli, Lory","Nicola Manzella","Massimo Bracci","Elisabetta Strafella","Sara Staffolani","Veronica Ciarapica","Alfredo Copertaro","Venerando Rapisarda","Caterina Ledda","Monica Amati","Matteo Valentino","Marco Tomasetti","Richard G.
