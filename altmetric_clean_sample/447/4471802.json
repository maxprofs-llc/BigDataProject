A cohort of 31 mother and neonate pairs, including 25 at-term caesarean (CS) and 6 vaginally (V) delivered neonates (DNs), were included in this study and 121 meconium\/faecal samples were collected at days 1 through 30 following birth. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assessed in 69 stool samples by phylogenetic microarray HITChip and inter- and intra-individual distributions were established by inter-OTUs correlation matrices and OTUs co-occurrence or co-exclusion networks. 1H-NMR metabolites were determined in 70 stool samples, PCA analysis was performed on 55 CS DNs samples, and metabolome\/OTUs co-correlations were assessed in 45 CS samples, providing an integrated map of the early microbiota OTUs-metabolome. A microbiota \"core\" of OTUs was identified that was independent of delivery mode and lactation stage, suggesting highly specialized communities that act as seminal colonizers of microbial networks. Correlations among OTUs, metabolites, and OTUs-metabolites revealed metabolic profiles associated with early microbial ecological dynamics, maturation of milk components, and host physiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Del Chierico, Federica","Vernocchi, Pamela","Petrucca, Andrea","Paci, Paola","Fuentes, Susana","Pratic\u00f2, Giulia","Capuani, Giorgio","Masotti, Andrea","Reddel, Sofia","Russo, Alessandra","Vallone, Cristina","Salvatori, Guglielmo","Buffone, Elsa","Signore, Fabrizio","Rigon, Giuliano","Dotta, Andrea","Miccheli, Alfredo","de Vos, Willem M","Dallapiccola, Bruno","Putignani, Lorenza"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0137347","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T10:07:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1464174008,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26332837?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26332837?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0137347"],"pmid":"26332837","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:01:29+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Phylogenetic and Metabolic Tracking of Gut Microbiota during Perinatal Development","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogenetic-metabolic-tracking-gut-microbiota-during-perinatal-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":3459434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4220593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229724,"mean":8.9850505086561,"rank":93012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":132379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229724,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110063,"mean":10.283128600244,"rank":49550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":58024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110063,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6007,"mean":8.8471405261405,"rank":2666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6007,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
