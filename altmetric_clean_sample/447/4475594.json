Eleven adolescent patients with an average age of 12.2 years were treated arthroscopically between January 2005 and February 2007. At follow-up evaluation at 69 months, we did not find any instability. Only minimal differences were found in the functional outcomes (Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores: 95.7 and 94.3, respectively). None of the patients had a leg-length discrepancy defined at the time of the final follow-up. The advantages of this technique are as follows: (a) it is a simple and reliable arthroscopic technique with a direct view, (b) the fixation is stable,","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dd5","authors":["Memisoglu, Kaya","Muezzinoglu, Umit S","Atmaca, Halil","Sarman, Hakan","Kesemenli, Cumhur C"],"doi":"10.1097\/bpb.0000000000000223","first_seen_on":"2015-09-05T08:50:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1060-152X","1473-5865"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics: Part B","last_mentioned_on":1448946605,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/9000\/00000\/Arthroscopic_fixation_with_intra_articular_button.99299.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/Abstract\/2016\/01000\/Arthroscopic_fixation_with_intra_articular_button.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpo-b\/9000\/00000\/Arthroscopic_fixation_with_intra_articular_button.99299.pdf","pmid":"26340367","pubdate":"2015-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","pediatrics"],"title":"Arthroscopic fixation with intra-articular button for tibial intercondylar eminence fractures in skeletally immature patients","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arthroscopic-fixation-intraarticular-button-tibial-intercondylar-eminence-fractures-skeletally-immat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":4907237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":973480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199846,"mean":9.7033717531087,"rank":138530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199846,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":665,"mean":0.76728614457831,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":665,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.66904761904762,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
