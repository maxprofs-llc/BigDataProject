Renal dysfunction is a common condition in HF which is associated with a worse survival. The study aims at identifying in patients with advanced HF treated with CRT the effect of baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), GFR improvement and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) change, after 6-months of CRT implant, on survival.\nThe study population consisted of 375 advanced HF patients who received a CRT between 1999 and 2009, of these 277 received also an ICD implant. Clinical characteristics (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, ischemic vs. non-ischemic etiology, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, LVEF, QRS duration and GFR were recorded. The use of common used drugs was evaluated. Cox proportional hazards analysis was calculated in order to evaluate variables associated to mortality.\nDuring a median follow-up of 43.0 months, 93 (24.8%) patients died. Patients deceased during the study had at baseline higher NYHA class and lower LVEF and GFR. In Cox regression analysis, GFR predicts long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.983; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.969-0.998; p = 0.023) independently from the effect of others covariates. In addition, a positive GFR improvement 6 months after CRT implant is significantly associated with a lower hazard of mortality (for each 10 mL\/min of GFR improvement HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75-0.99; p = 0.038).\nGFR is a significant predictor of mortality in advanced HF patients who received CRT. A GFR improvement 6 months after CRT implant is significantly associated with a lower hazard of mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000cccd","authors":["Gronda, Edoardo","Genovese, Stefano","Padeletti, Luigi","Cacciatore, Francesco","Vitale, Dino Franco","Bragato, Renato","Innocenti, Lisa","Schiano, Concetta","Sommese, Linda","De Pascale, Maria Rosaria","Genovese, Luca","Abete, Pasquale","Donatelli, Francesco","Napoli, Claudio"],"doi":"10.5603\/cj.a2015.0019","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T09:31:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1897-5593"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cardiology journal","last_mentioned_on":1441366586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26325259?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26325259","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Renal function impairment predicts mortality in patients with chronic heart failure treated with resynchronization therapy.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-function-impairment-predicts-mortality-patients-chronic-heart-failure-treated-resynchronizatio-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230503,"mean":5.96748679288,"rank":2183663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4013574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230503,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185467,"mean":9.8241789977679,"rank":65608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":118284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185467,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":1.3368686868687,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
