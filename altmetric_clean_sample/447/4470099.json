A. Mayer. Since ancient times, ginseng has been used as one kind of treatment drug or tonic in China and even other eastern countries like Korea and Japan. Pharmacological active chemical ingredients and its extract of ginseng are a mixture of triterpenoid saponins, collectively called ginsenosides. Among them, ginsenoside Rg1 is the most pharmacological active one.\nBased on prior experimental results and the understanding of alcoholic hepatitis, the major aim of this study is to investigate whether Rg1 is beneficial in a rodent model mimic alcoholic hepatic injury associated with binge drinking and explore the underlying possible mechanisms.\nC57BL\/6 mice were given oral consumption of 6g\/kg alcohol 1h after treated with Rg1 (10, 20 and 40mg\/kg) or dexamethasone (1mg\/kg) for 9 consecutive days. Biochemical analyses were performed and liver fragments were processed for microscopy, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.\nAccording to our data, Rg1 treatment significantly reversed the high mortality rate induced by alcohol consumption and also alleviated liver impairment as evidenced by the decrease of serum parameters. Meanwhile, histological and ultrastructural analysis of alcoholic groups showed hepatocellular impairment but restored in Rg1-treated groups. Overproductive inflammatory cytokines were also suppressed by Rg1 in alcohol-intoxicated mouse livers. In addition, changes of GR related NF-\u03baB pathway, including phospho-I\u03baB-\u03b1, were also modulated to normal levels.\nThis study demonstrates that Rg1 might promote GR mediating the repression of NF-\u03baB and inhibit the inflammatory reactions in alcoholic hepatitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f23cf058f610002d8d","authors":["Gao, Yan","Chu, Shifeng","Li, Jingwei","Li, Jianping","Zhang, Zhao","Xia, Congyuan","Heng, Yang","Zhang, Meijin","Hu, Jinfeng","Wei, Guining","Li, Yueting","Chen, Naihong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2015.07.020","endpage":"240","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T00:10:39+00:00","issns":["1872-7573","03788741"],"journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1470741431,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378874115300374","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26196399?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26196399","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"231","subjects":["socialsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Anti-inflammatory function of ginsenoside Rg1 on alcoholic hepatitis through glucocorticoid receptor related nuclear factor-kappa B pathway ","type":"article","volume":"173","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiinflammatory-function-ginsenoside-rg1-alcoholic-hepatitis-through-glucocorticoid-receptor-relate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8187659,"mean":6.9230329122133,"rank":4339990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2274496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8187659,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232091,"mean":9.1410443793356,"rank":121311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":87526,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232091,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2677,"mean":4.0206718983558,"rank":1237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2677,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.292,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HerbExtractCo\/statuses\/639591297133637632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4470099],"posted_on":"2015-09-04T00:10:22+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"HerbExtractCo","tweeter_id":"275278974","geo":{"lt":-33.86785,"ln":151.20732,"country":"AU"}},"tweet_id":"639591297133637632"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/762970978699743232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4470099],"posted_on":"2016-08-09T11:17:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
