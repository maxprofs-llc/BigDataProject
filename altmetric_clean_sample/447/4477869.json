Vascular dementia\/vascular cognitive impairment is characterized by better verbal memory performance, worse quantitative executive functioning, and prominent depressed mood. Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia are equally contrasted with AD by defective processing of visual information, better performance on executively supported verbal learning tasks, greater attentional variability, poorer qualitative executive functioning, and the presence of mood-congruent visual hallucinations. The frontal variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (frontotemporal dementia) differs from AD by better multimodal retention on learning tasks, different patterns of generative word fluency, defective qualitative executive functioning, and by markedly impairment of comportment. For temporal variants of frontotemporal lobar degenerations, progressive aphasia and semantic dementia, worse language performance relative to AD is typically characteristic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000cac","authors":["Levy, James A","Chelune, Gordon J"],"doi":"10.1177\/0891988707308806","first_seen_on":"2015-09-06T02:36:19+00:00","issns":["0891-9887"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1441506961,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18004009"],"pmid":"18004009","pubdate":"2007-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics","psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"Cognitive-behavioral profiles of neurodegenerative dementias: beyond Alzheimer's disease.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitivebehavioral-profiles-neurodegenerative-dementias-beyond-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6298319,"mean":5.808944756679,"rank":4650024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":934656,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6298319,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195073,"mean":9.625439355725,"rank":134484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195073,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189,"mean":3.8184680851064,"rank":133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":6.5083333333333,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
