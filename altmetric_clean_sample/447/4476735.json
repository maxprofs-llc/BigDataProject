Recent studies have shed new light on the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness. The aim of this study was to evaluate arterial stiffness using pulse wave velocity (PWV) in adult CD patients without cardiovascular risk factors in comparison with a control group.\nA total of 58 patients with CD without cardiovascular risk factors and age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All patients completed a standard questionnaire form, and various laboratory parameters were assessed. Vascular measurements, including PWV, were carried out using a Mobil-O-Graph 24-h pulse wave analysis monitor, an automatic oscillometric device.\nAlthough cardiovascular risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, were significantly lower (P<0.05) in celiac patients than in controls, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homocysteine, and 24\u2009h, day, and night PWV values were higher in patients with CD than in controls (P<0.05). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that PWV was correlated positively with age and the duration of CD.\nThis study found increased arterial stiffness, homocysteine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in patients with CD and provides evidence for the potential contribution of these parameters and inflammation toward arterial stiffening, independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058ca","authors":["Korkmaz, H\u00fcseyin","Sozen, Mehmet","Kebapcilar, Levent"],"doi":"10.1097\/meg.0000000000000437","first_seen_on":"2015-09-05T14:43:10+00:00","issns":["1473-5687","0954-691X"],"issue":"10","journal":"European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1441496819,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/eurojgh\/Abstract\/2015\/10000\/Increased_arterial_stiffness_and_its_relationship.13.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/eurojgh\/2015\/10000\/Increased_arterial_stiffness_and_its_relationship.13.pdf","pmid":"26181110","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1193","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Increased arterial stiffness and its relationship with inflammation, insulin, and insulin resistance in celiac disease","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-arterial-stiffness-relationship-inflammation-insulin-insulin-resistance-celiac-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6288002,"mean":5.8074787723439,"rank":2312030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3884225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6288002,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194436,"mean":9.591830832926,"rank":75367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":115283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194436,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":729,"mean":2.3360796703297,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":527,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":729,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.77166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mistlavcarrillo\/statuses\/640310173714661376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4476735],"posted_on":"2015-09-05T23:46:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Mistlav Carrillo","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"mistlavcarrillo","tweeter_id":"23142751","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":113},"tweet_id":"640310173714661376"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/travismarcal\/statuses\/640310182631727105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4476735],"posted_on":"2015-09-05T23:46:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Travis Marcal","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","id_on_source":"travismarcal","tweeter_id":"23523288","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":534},"tweet_id":"640310182631727105"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/glutenfreealert\/statuses\/640310182120034304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4476735],"posted_on":"2015-09-05T23:46:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Mikhail Ramirez","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_1_normal.png","id_on_source":"glutenfreealert","tweeter_id":"41719819","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":553},"tweet_id":"640310182120034304"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MisterMcCeliac\/statuses\/640310184619802628","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4476735],"posted_on":"2015-09-05T23:46:59+00:00","author":{"name":"MisterMcCeliac","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"MisterMcCeliac","tweeter_id":"41728780","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":598},"tweet_id":"640310184619802628"}]}}
