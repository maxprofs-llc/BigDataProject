Recently, accumulating evidence has established that aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal transition activation plays a crucial role in the genesis, invasion, and metastasis of various cancers, including breast cancer. In this paper, we found that miR-137, which has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers, could significantly suppress the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells, which might be correlated with its suppressive effects on the EMT procedure. Upon transfection, the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, was up-regulated, and the mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin and Vimentin, were suppressed. Moreover, we also found that carboxyl-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) was a putative target gene of miR-137 in MCF-7 cells, and might be involved in the suppressive effects, which might provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for human breast cancer in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007676","authors":["Han, Yong","Bi, Yueyang","Bi, Haiyang","Diao, Caimei","Zhang, Guoqiang","Cheng, Kai","Yang, Zhenlin"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13577-015-0124-4","first_seen_on":"2015-09-05T10:05:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1749-0774"],"journal":"Human Cell","last_mentioned_on":1441447510,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26337822?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26337822","pubdate":"2015-09-05T22:01:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Culture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Embryology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Stem Cells","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"miR-137 suppresses the invasion and procedure of EMT of human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 through targeting CtBP1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir137-suppresses-invasion-procedure-emt-human-breast-cancer-cell-line-mcf7-through-targeting-ctbp1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6287862,"mean":5.8064798900589,"rank":5353771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6287862,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194422,"mean":9.5922764413307,"rank":155744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194422,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.6366111111111,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
