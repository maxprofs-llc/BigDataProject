PM","A Comparative Insight into Amprenavir Resistance of Mutations V32I, G48V, I50V, I54V, and I84V\u2026 #AMR #ABresistance"],"citation":{"abstract":"Drug resistance of mutations V32I, G48V, I50V, I54V and I84V in HIV-1 protease (PR) were found in clinical treatment of HIV patients with the drug Amprenavir (APV). In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of drug resistance associated with these mutations, thermodynamic integration (TI) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods were applied to calculate binding free energies of APV to these mutated and wild type PRs. The relative binding free energy difference from TI calculation reveals that the decrease in van der Waals interaction of APV with mutated PRs relative to the wild-type PR mainly drives the drug resistance. This result is in good agreement with the previous experimental results, and is also consistent with the result from MM-PBSA calculations. Analyses based on molecular dynamics trajectory show that these mutations can adjust the shape and conformation of the binding pocket, which provides main contributions to the decrease in the van der Waals interactions of APV with mutated PRs. The present study could provide important guidance for designing new potent inhibitors that could alleviate drug resistance of PR due to mutations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Jianzhong Chen","Chen, Jianzhong","Wang, Xingyu","Zhu, Tong","Zhang, Qinggang","Zhang, J Z H"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jcim.5b00173","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T17:15:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-960X","1549-9596"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Chemical Information & Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1468665936,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jcim.5b00173","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26317593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26317593?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26317593","pubdate":"2015-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Computation Theory And Mathematics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","medicalinformatics"],"title":"A Comparative Insight into Amprenavir Resistance of Mutations V32I, G48V, I50V, I54V, and I84V in HIV-1 Protease Based on Thermodynamic Integration and MM-PBSA Methods","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-insight-amprenavir-resistance-mutations-v32i-g48v-i50v-i54v-i84v-hiv1-protease-based-the"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8078414,"mean":6.8578859978971,"rank":4038188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3834521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8078414,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231494,"mean":9.1146365289661,"rank":110555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":111236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231494,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1388,"mean":3.940579668349,"rank":805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1388,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.4258064516129,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
