Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has recently been used to diagnosis HF. We evaluated CMR T2 mapping and MIBG scintigraphy in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Methods Consecutively, 22 DCM patients [aged 56.8\u00b113.4 years; 6 women and 16 men; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 31.9\u00b110.7%] who underwent T2 mapping and MIBG scintigraphy were retrospectively evaluated. Echocardiography results were recorded at baseline and the 6-month follow-up. Patients with an increased LVEF \u226515% between the 2 measures were considered to be responders. We measured each patient's T2 values and MIBG indices [the heart-to-mediastinum ratio (H\/M) in the early phase, H\/M in the delayed phase, and the washout rate (WOR)] at baseline. We compared these values between the 12 responders and 10 non-responders. Results The mean T2 value for all patients was 64.5\u00b16.6 ms. The mean values of early H\/M, delayed H\/M, and WOR were 2.06\u00b10.25, 1.94\u00b10.35, and 43.5\u00b111.8%, respectively. The T2 values were found to correlate with MIBG indices (p<0.05 for all) and were lower in the responders than non-responders (61.4 vs. 68.1 ms, p=0.013). MIBG indices were not significantly different. Conclusion Our study shows that the T2 values correlated with the MIBG indices and were increased in non-responders. T2 mapping may be useful in assessing the cardiac function and functional recovery in DCM patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077d5","authors":["Ito, Tatsuro","K Kono, Atsushi","Takamine, Sachiko","Shigeru, Mayumi","Mori, Shumpei","Takaya, Tomofumi","Fujiwara, Sei","Nishii, Tatsuya","Shiotani, Hideyuki","Sugimura, Kazuro","Hirata, Ken-Ichi"],"doi":"10.2169\/internalmedicine.54.4493","first_seen_on":"2015-09-04T20:40:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1349-7235"],"issue":"17","journal":"Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1441508400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26328635?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/internalmedicine\/54\/17\/54_54.4493\/_article"],"pmid":"26328635","pubdate":"2015-09-04T22:03:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"A Comparison of Quantitative T2 Mapping on Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging with Metaiodobenzylguanidine Scintigraphy and Left Ventricular Functional Recovery in Dilated Cardiomyopathy: A Retrospective Pilot Study","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-quantitative-t2-mapping-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging-metaiodobenzylguanidine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6288002,"mean":5.8074787723439,"rank":5353900,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6288002,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194533,"mean":9.5571797544876,"rank":155835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194533,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":778,"mean":1.765842985843,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":778,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.85789473684211,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
