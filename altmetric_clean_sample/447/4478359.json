Nevertheless, the precise role of unconventional subsets like the IL-22-producing NKp46(+) cells (NK22) remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of NK22 cells in IRI in transplantation, particularly with respect to regulation by the transcription factor ROR-gamma-t (ROR\u03b3t).\nTo explore the role of NK22 cells in IRI in the absence of adaptive immunity, B6.ROR\u03b3t-(gfp\/wt)-reporter and B6.ROR\u03b3t-(gfp\/gfp)-knockout (KO) mice on a Rag-KO background underwent 90 minutes partial warm ischemia, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion.\nRag-KO mice that possess fully functional NKp46(+) cells, and Rag-common-\u03b3-chain-double-KO (Rag-\u03b3c-DKO) mice that lack T, B and NKp46(+) cells, were used as controls. We found that Rag-\u03b3c-DKO mice lacking NK22 cells show more severe levels of hepatocellular damage (GPT, histological injury) when compared to both Rag-ROR\u03b3t-reporter and Rag-KO mice that posses NK22 cells. Importantly, Rag-ROR\u03b3t-reporter and Rag-KO mice undergoing IRI expressed high protein levels of both IL-22 and GFP(ROR\u03b3t), suggesting a protective role for ROR\u03b3t(+) NK22 cells in IRI. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ROR\u03b3t critically protects from IRI through the induction of hepatic NK22 cells by studying Rag-Ror\u03b3t-DKO mice under IRI conditions. We found that the lack of ROR\u03b3t(+) NK22 cells in Rag-Ror\u03b3t-DKO mice significantly enhanced IR-induced hepatocellular injury, a phenotype that could be reversed upon adoptive transfer of Rag-Ror\u03b3t-reporter NK22 cells into DKO mice.\nROR\u03b3t(+) NK22 cells play an important protective role in IRI in mice.","authors":["Eggenhofer, Elke","Sabet-Rashedi, Manije","Lantow, Margareta","Renner, Philipp","Rovira, Jordi","Koehl, Gudrun E","Schlitt, Hans J","Geissler, Edward K","Kroemer, Alexander"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhep.2015.08.023","first_seen_on":"2015-09-06T10:07:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0641"],"journal":"Journal of hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1441534743,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26341825?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26341825?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26341825","pubdate":"2015-09-06T22:00:12+00:00","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"ROR\u03b3t(+) IL-22-producing NKp46(+) cells protect from hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ror%CE%B3t-il22producing-nkp46-cells-protect-hepatic-ischemia-reperfusion-injury-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
