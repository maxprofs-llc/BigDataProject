Patients managed with ECMO were younger, had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and, in the 24 hours prior to the period of maximum sedative exposure, had a higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fraction of inspired oxygen and were more likely to receive renal replacement and high-dose fentanyl (\u2265 2000 mcg\/24 hours) therapy. An adjusted multivariable linear regression model using the natural logarithmic value of the maximum sedative exposure in a 6-hour period revealed that patient age (p=0.04) and administration of high-dose fentanyl in the 24 hours prior to the 6-hour period of maximum sedative use (p<0.0001) were each independently associated with the maximum 6-hour sedative requirement reached, but the use of ECMO was not (p=0.52).\nAlthough the application of ECMO during severe ARDS resulted in a period of maximum sedation exposure that was both greater and took longer to reach, factors other than ECMO, particularly high-dose opioid administration, appeared more likely to account for this maximum sedation use. Further research surrounding sedative requirements, clearance, and patient response during ECMO is required. This article is protected by copyright.
