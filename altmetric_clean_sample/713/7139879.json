However, a precarious understanding of how resistance emerges, and a lack of tractable experimental systems hinders progress. We evaluated the potential of primary RCC cultures (derived from tumors and tumorgrafts) to signal to endothelial cells (and fibroblasts) in vitro and to stimulate angiogenesis ex vivo in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. From 65 patients, 27 primary cultures were established including several from patients with sunitinib-resistant RCC. RCC cultures supported endothelial cell (EC) survival in coculture assays and induced angiogenesis in CAM assays. RCC-induced EC survival was sensitive to sunitinib in half of the tumors, and was refractory in tumors from resistant patients. Sunitinib sensitivity correlated with VEGF production. RCC caused paracrine ERK activation in EC which was inhibited by sunitinib in sensitive, but not resistant tumors. As determined by FRS2 phosphorylation in fibroblasts, RCC broadly induced low level FGFR signaling. Whereas ERK activation in EC was uniformly inhibited by combined VEGF\/PDGF\/FGF receptor inhibitors, paracrine ERK activation in fibroblasts was blocked in only a fraction of tumors. Our data show that RCC activates EC through VEGF-dependent and -independent pathways, that sunitinib sensitivity correlates with VEGF-mediated ERK activation, and that combined inhibition of VEGF\/PDGF\/FGF receptors is sufficient to inhibit mitogenic signaling in EC but not in fibroblasts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Tran, Tram Anh","Leong, Hon S","Pavia-Jimenez, Andrea","Fedyshyn, Slavic","Yang, Juan","Kucejova, Blanka","Sivanand, Sharanya","Spence, Patrick","Xie, Xian-Jin","Pe\u00f1a-Llopis, Samuel","Power, Nicholas","Brugarolas, James","Tram Anh Tran","Hon Sing Leong","Andrea Pavia-Jimenez","Slavic Fedyshyn","Juan Yang","Blanka Kucejova","Sharanya Sivanand","Patrick Spence","Xian-Jin Xie","Samuel Pe\u00f1a-Llopis","Nicholas Power","James Brugarolas"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.00189-16","endpage":"1855","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T10:13:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1098-5549","0270-7306"],"issue":"13","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1462356736,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27141054?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27141054","pubdate":"2016-05-04T22:00:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1836","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"FGFR-Dependent and -Independent Paracrine Signaling by Sunitinib-Resistant RCC.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1128\/MCB.00189-16","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fibroblast-growth-factor-receptordependent-independent-paracrine-signaling-sunitinibresistant-renal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":6621399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266362,"mean":11.378322937667,"rank":222909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266362,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3782,"mean":2.8980941549855,"rank":3533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3782,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":5.8345098039216,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
