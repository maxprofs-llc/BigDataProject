A large-scale short-rotation coppice (SRC) site with poplar (Populus) and willow (Salix) was established to examine the land-use transitions of arable and pasture to bioenergy. Soil C pools, output fluxes of soil CO 2, CH 4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and volatile organic compounds, as well as input fluxes from litter fall and from roots, were measured over a 4-year period, along with environmental parameters. Three approaches were used to estimate changes in the soil C. The largest C pool in the soil was the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and increased after four years of SRC from 10.9 to 13.9\u00a0kg\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2). The belowground woody biomass (coarse roots) represented the second largest C pool, followed by the fine roots (Fr). The annual leaf fall represented the largest C input to the soil, followed by weeds and Fr. After the first harvest, we observed a very large C input into the soil from high Fr mortality. The weed inputs decreased as trees grew older and bigger. Soil respiration averaged 568.9\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2)\u00a0yr(-1). Leaching of DOC increased over the three years from 7.9 to 14.5\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2). The pool-based approach indicated an increase of 3360\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2) in the SOC pool over the 4-year period, which was high when compared with the -27\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2) estimated by the flux-based approach and the -956\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m(-2) of the combined eddy-covariance\u00a0+\u00a0biometric approach. High uncertainties were associated to the pool-based approach. Our results suggest using the C flux approach for the assessment of the short-\/medium-term SOC balance at our site, while SOC pool changes can only be used for long-term C balance assessments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5253cf058f610003cb3","authors":["Berhongaray, G","Verlinden, M S","Broeckx, LS","Janssens, IA","Ceulemans, R","Berhongaray, Gonzalo","Verlinden, Melanie S.","Broeckx, Laura S.","Janssens, Ivan A.","Ceulemans, Reinhart"],"doi":"10.1111\/gcbb.12369","first_seen_on":"2016-05-04T07:34:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1757-1707","1757-1693"],"issue":"2","journal":"GCB Bioenergy","last_mentioned_on":1462347269,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/gcbb.12369&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcbb.12369\/pdf","pmid":"28261329","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Soil carbon and belowground carbon balance of a short\u2010rotation coppice: assessments from three different approaches","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soil-carbon-belowground-carbon-balance-shortrotation-coppice-assessments-three-different-approaches-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7651252,"mean":6.5763358914726,"rank":5787625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1029869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7651252,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266362,"mean":11.378361982422,"rank":186585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266362,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":416,"mean":5.8345831325301,"rank":303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":416,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":11.1016,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
