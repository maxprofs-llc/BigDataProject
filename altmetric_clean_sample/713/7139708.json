Patients with chronic pancreatitis are at an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer, which can also masquerade as acute or chronic pancreatitis, making the diagnosis challenging. Here we describe the first case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma developing in the liver of a patient after TPIAT for presumed benign chronic pancreatitis. Retrospective analysis of the patient's preoperative serum revealed normal carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, but elevated levels of microRNA-10b, -30c, and -106b compared to controls. Screening guidelines are important to reduce the risk of transplantation of malignant tissue. More sensitive screening tools, including the potential use of microRNAs, are needed to detect early, preclinical disease given the highly malignant nature of pancreatic cancer.
