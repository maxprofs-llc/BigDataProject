The main objective of this study was to develop multivariable NTCP models for these side effects.\nThe study sample was composed of 262 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (stage T1-3). Anorectal toxicity was prospectively assessed using a standardized follow-up program. Different anatomical subregions within and around the anorectum were delineated. A LASSO logistic regression analysis was used to analyze dose volume effects on toxicity.\nIn the univariable analysis, rectal bleeding, increase in stool frequency and fecal incontinence were significantly associated with a large number of dosimetric parameters. The collinearity between these predictors was high (VIF>5). In the multivariable model, rectal bleeding was associated with the anorectum (V70) and anticoagulant use, fecal incontinence was associated with the external sphincter (V15) and the iliococcygeal muscle (V55). Finally, increase in stool frequency was associated with the iliococcygeal muscle (V45) and the levator ani (V40). No significant associations were found for rectal pain.\nDifferent anorectal side effects are associated with different anatomical substructures within and around the anorectum. The dosimetric variables associated with these side effects can be used to optimize radiotherapy treatment planning aiming at prevention of specific side effects and to estimate the benefit of new radiation technologies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003423","authors":["Wouter Schaake","Arjen van der Schaaf","Lisanne V. van Dijk","Alfons H.H.
