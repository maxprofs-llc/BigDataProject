Tumors from 26 of these animals showed histopathological evidence of immunological attack as shown by marked necrosis or lymphocytic infiltration. Thirteen showed moderate to marked tumor necrosis or liquefaction. Twenty-one demonstrated lymphoid infiltration, and seven demonstrated encapsulation. Twelve animals showed obvious clinical improvement as assessed by tumor shrinkage, tumor necrosis, or prolonged survival; these included five of seven animals with fibrosarcomas. It is believed that acemannan exerts its antitumor activity through macrophage activation and the release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and interferon.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce75","authors":["Harris, C","Pierce, K","King, G","Yates, K M","Hall, J","Tizard, I"],"first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T17:49:55+00:00","issns":["0952-8172"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular biotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1479923392,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1768373"],"pmid":"1768373","pubdate":"1991-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Efficacy of acemannan in treatment of canine and feline spontaneous neoplasms.","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-acemannan-treatment-canine-feline-spontaneous-neoplasms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729992,"mean":6.6289680453638,"rank":1884762,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4817228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248095,"mean":12.164330100687,"rank":84040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":160544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248095,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
