Demographics, medical information, and clinical assessments from 175 evaluable patients with at least one follow-up from 09\/12 to 10\/14 were analyzed. The majority of patients were being treated for or had a history of breast (n\u00a0=\u00a090, 53\u00a0%), gynecologic (n\u00a0=\u00a054, 32\u00a0%), or colorectal\/anal (n\u00a0=\u00a015, 9\u00a0%) cancers. An assessment form included a clinician evaluation, Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS), Vulvar Assessment Scale (VuAS), and patient-reported outcomes. Compliance with treatment recommendations were summarized, and changes over time were compared for clinical outcomes.\nMean number of visits was 3.43. Mean age was 55.4\u00a0years; 92\u00a0% (n\u00a0=\u00a0155\/169) were in menopause. Treatment strategies included rationale and instruction for use of vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, pelvic floor exercises, and dilator therapy, in addition to psychosexual education regarding sexual changes (response, anatomy, and function) associated with cancer treatment and support. At last assessment, 89\u00a0% had complied with the clinical recommendation (moisturize 2-5+ times\/week). Vaginal pH scores >6.5 declined over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). VAS scores improved by last assessment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), as did VuAS scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Sexual function scores significantly improved (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), confidence about future sexual activity increased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and sexual\/vaginal health concerns decreased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00003).\nSignificant changes were observed in women using treatment strategies, with improvement in vulvovaginal symptoms, a decrease in elevated vaginal pH and pain with exams, enhanced sexual function, and increased\u00a0intimacy confidence.\nThese findings have high clinical relevance for symptom management with improvement of sexual function using simple strategies and clinical tools in the oncology setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb1","authors":["Carter, Jeanne","Stabile, Cara","Seidel, Barbara","Baser, Raymond E","Goldfarb, Shari","Goldfrank, Deborah J"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11764-016-0585-9","first_seen_on":"2016-11-23T15:25:26+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1932-2267","1932-2259"],"journal":"Journal of Cancer Survivorship","last_mentioned_on":1481598472,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27868156"],"pmid":"27868156","pubdate":"2016-11-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Vaginal and sexual health treatment strategies within a female sexual medicine program for cancer patients and survivors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vaginal-sexual-health-treatment-strategies-within-female-sexual-medicine-program-cancer-patients-sur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":5696109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1904360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253508,"mean":12.121564051485,"rank":163418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":78304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253508,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":371,"mean":7.7856108108108,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":371,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.645,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
