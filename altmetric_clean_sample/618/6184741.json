Receptor usage and envelope (env) sequence variation define 3 MLV host range subgroups in laboratory mice: ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic MLVs (E-, P-, X-MLVs). These exogenous MLVs derive from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that were acquired by the wild mouse progenitors of laboratory mice about 1 MYA. We analyzed the genomes of 7 MLVs isolated from Eurasian and American wild mice and 3 previously sequenced MLVs to describe their relationships and identify their possible ERV progenitors. The phylogenetic tree based on the receptor determining regions of env produced expected host range clusters, but these clusters are not maintained in trees generated from other virus regions. Colinear alignments of the viral genomes identified segmental homologies to ERVs of different host range subgroups. 6 MLVs show close relationships to a small xenotropic ERV subgroup largely confined to the inbred mouse Y Chromosome. Env variations define 3 E-MLV subtypes one of which carries duplications of varying size, sequence and location in the proline-rich region of env. Outside env, all E-MLVs are related to different nonecotropic MLVs. These results document the diversity in gammaretroviruses isolated from globally distributed Mus subspecies, provide insight into their origins and relationships, and indicate that recombination has had an important role in the evolution of these mutagenic and pathogenic agents.\nLaboratory mice carry mouse leukemia viruses (MLVs) of 3 host range groups which were acquired from their wild mouse progenitors. We sequenced the complete genomes of 7 infectious MLVs isolated from geographically separated Eurasian and American wild mice, and compared them with endogenous germline retroviruses (ERVs) acquired early in house mouse evolution. We did this because the laboratory mouse viruses derive directly from specific ERVs, or arise by recombination between different ERVs. The 6 distinctively different wild mouse viruses appear to be recombinants, often involving different host range subgroups, and most are related to a distinctive, largely Y-Chromosome-linked MLV ERV subtype. MLVs with ecotropic host range show the greatest variability with extensive inter- and intrasubtype envelope differences, and with homologies to other host range subgroups outside envelope. The sequence diversity among these wild mouse isolates helps define their relationships and origins, and emphasizes the importance of recombination in their evolution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Devinka Bamunusinghe","Zohreh Naghashfar","Alicia Buckler-White","Ronald Plishka","Surendranath Baliji","Qingping Liu","Joshua Kassner","Andrew Oler","Janet Hartley","Christine A.
