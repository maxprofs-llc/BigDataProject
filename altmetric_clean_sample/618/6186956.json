However, barriers made from materials of inhomogeneous impedance eliminate this drawback by altering the behavior of sound as it undergoes multiple reflections between the barriers. In this paper, a theoretical approach is carried out to estimate the performance of the proposed barriers. By combining the ray-tracing method and sound diffraction theory, the existence of different ray paths between the proposed barriers is revealed. Compared to conventional rigid-walled barriers, barriers having inhomogeneous surfaces may have the potential to be widely used in environmental noise control.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f2","authors":["Xu Wang","Xu Wang","Xiaonan Wang","Wuzhou Yu","Zaixiu Jiang","Dongxing Mao"],"doi":"10.1121\/1.4943771","endpage":"EL69","first_seen_on":"2016-03-15T20:31:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0001-4966","1520-8524"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","last_mentioned_on":1457968734,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/asa\/journal\/jasa\/139\/3\/10.1121\/1.4943771?TRACK=RSS&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27036289","pubdate":"2016-03-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Acoustical Society of America","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"EL63","subjects":["audiology","speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"A theoretical model of barriers having inhomogeneous impedance surfaces","type":"article","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theoretical-model-barriers-having-inhomogeneous-impedance-surfaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":6396736,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275989,"mean":10.894103801614,"rank":233501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2606,"mean":3.8110879078695,"rank":2182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2606,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127,"mean":3.9995079365079,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
