Hydrol was efficiently metabolized to l-lactic acid with optical purity of >97.5%, though hydrol contained mixed sugars such as glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltodextrin. Combined utilization of hydrol, SCR, and malt was enough to sustain lactic acid fermentation by E. faecalis RKY1. In order to reduce the amount of nitrogen sources and product inhibition, cell-recycle repeated-batch fermentation was employed, where a high cell mass (26.3g\/L) was obtained. Lactic acid productivity was improved by removal of lactic acid from fermentation broth by membrane filtration and by linearly increased cell density. When the total of 10 repeated-batch fermentations were carried out using 100g\/L hydrol, 150g\/L SCR hydrolyzate, and 20g\/L malt hydrolyzate as the main nutrients, lactic acid productivity was increased significantly from 3.20g\/L\/h to 6.37g\/L\/h.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Reddy, Lebaka Veeranjaneya","Kim, Young-Min","Yun, Jong-Sun","Ryu, Hwa-Won","Wee, Young-Jung"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2016.02.115","endpage":"194","first_seen_on":"2016-03-15T17:08:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2976","09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1457951316,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26970921?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26970921","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"187","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"l-Lactic acid production by combined utilization of agricultural bioresources as renewable and economical substrates through batch and repeated-batch fermentation of Enterococcus faecalis RKY1","type":"article","volume":"209","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/llactic-acid-production-combined-utilization-agricultural-bioresources-renewable-economical-substrat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7391940,"mean":6.4229753378604,"rank":6396701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7391940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275990,"mean":10.894038602987,"rank":233480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275990,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1756,"mean":2.1817720797721,"rank":1239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1756,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":2.0945555555556,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
