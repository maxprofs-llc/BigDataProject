We produced 2 S. pneumoniae serotype 3 (SP3) strains in which the pneumolysin gene (ply) was recoded with underrepresented codon pairs while retaining its amino acid sequence and determined their ply expression and pneumolysin production in vitro and their virulence in a mouse pulmonary infection model. Expression of ply and production of pneumolysin of the recoded SP3 strains were decreased, and the recoded SP3 strains were less virulent in mice than the wild-type SP3 strain or a \u0394ply SP3 strain. Further studies showed that the least virulent recoded strain induced a markedly reduced inflammatory response in the lungs compared with the wild-type or \u0394ply strain. These findings suggest that reducing pneumococcal virulence gene expression by altering codon-pair bias could hold promise for rational design of live-attenuated pneumococcal vaccines.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df6","authors":["Coleman JR","Papamichail D","Yano M","Garc\u00eda-Su\u00e1rez Mdel M","Pirofski LA"],"doi":"10.1093\/infdis\/jir010","first_seen_on":"2013-01-21T03:41:25+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["0022-1899"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1358742595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21343143"],"pmcid":"PMC3069727","pmid":"21343143","pubdate":"2011-02-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Designed reduction of Streptococcus pneumoniae pathogenicity via synthetic changes in virulence factor codon-pair bias.","type":"article","volume":"203","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/designed-reduction-streptococcus-pneumoniae-pathogenicity-via-synthetic-changes-virulence-factor-cod"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285338,"mean":6.0056064653374,"rank":193935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285338,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3380,"mean":5.2426546315478,"rank":2463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3380,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":11.855545126354,"rank":217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
