The initial Toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent phase is mediated by dendritic cell uptake of apoptotic cell debris and associated nucleic acids, whereas the subsequent TLR-dependent phase serves an amplification function and is mediated by uptake of TLR ligands derived from self-antigens (principally nucleic acids) complexed with autoantibodies. Both phases depend on elaboration of type I interferons (IFNs), and therapeutic interruption of induction or activity of these cytokines in predisposed individuals might have a substantial mitigating effect in lupus and other autoimmune diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003166","authors":["Baccala R","Hoebe K","Kono DH","Beutler B","Theofilopoulos AN"],"doi":"10.1038\/nm1590","first_seen_on":"2013-01-19T21:14:38+00:00","issns":["1078-8956"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1360956454,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17479100"],"pmid":"17479100","pubdate":"2007-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","medicine"],"title":"TLR-dependent and TLR-independent pathways of type I interferon induction in systemic autoimmunity.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tlrdependent-tlrindependent-pathways-type-i-interferon-induction-systemic-autoimmunity-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2749198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":719580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280489,"mean":5.7891300804314,"rank":207603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280489,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3430,"mean":14.306686497521,"rank":3148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3430,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":16.629626168224,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
