Here we show that colonies of the saprophytic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes undergo synchronized multicellular behaviour on agar plates, in response to oscillating light\/dark conditions, giving rise to alternating ring formation (opaque and translucent rings). On agar plates, bacteria from opaque rings survive increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as repeated cycles of light and dark, better than bacteria from translucent rings. The ring formation is strictly dependent on a blue-light receptor, Lmo0799, acting through the stress-sigma factor, \u03c3(B) . A transposon screening identified 48 mutants unable to form rings at alternating light conditions, with several of them showing a decreased \u03c3(B) activity\/level. However, some of the tested mutants displayed a varied \u03c3(B) activity depending on which of the two stress conditions tested (light or H(2) O(2) exposure). Intriguingly, the transcriptional regulator PrfA and the virulence factor ActA were shown to be required for ring formation by a mechanism involving activation of \u03c3(B) . All in all, this suggests a distinct pathway for Lmo0799 that converge into a common signalling pathway for \u03c3(B) activation. Our results show that night and day cycles co-ordinate a reversible differentiation of a L.\u2009monocytogenes colony at room temperature, by a process synchronized by a blue-light receptor and \u03c3(B) .","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["Tiensuu, Teresa","Andersson, Christopher","Ryd\u00e9n, Patrik","Johansson, J\u00f6rgen","Tiensuu T","Andersson C","Ryd\u00e9n P","Johansson J"],"doi":"10.1111\/mmi.12140","endpage":"924","first_seen_on":"2013-01-21T10:26:24+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2958","0950-382X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1358770575,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.12140\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.12140\/pdf","pmid":"23331346","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"909","subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Cycles of light and dark co\u00e2\u0080\u0090ordinate reversible colony differentiation in Listeria monocytogenes","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cycles-light-dark-coordinate-reversible-colony-differentiation-listeria-monocytogenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":2924333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3474239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":292707,"mean":6.4978900808321,"rank":132879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":149531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":292707,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2274,"mean":3.0066476022877,"rank":1346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2274,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85,"mean":2.3883095238095,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
