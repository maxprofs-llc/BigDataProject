In this study, we measured the duration mismatch negativity (dMMN), an event-related potential, and cognitive performance in subjects with at-risk mental state (ARMS), patients with first-episode or chronic schizophrenia, and healthy volunteers. The main interest was to determine if these neurocognitive measures predict progression to overt schizophrenia in ARMS subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yuko Higuchi","Tomiki Sumiyoshi","Tomonori Seo","Tomohiro Miyanishi","Yasuhiro Kawasaki","Michio Suzuki"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0054080","first_seen_on":"2013-01-18T18:59:41+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1374789663,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0054080"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0054080.pdf","pmid":"23349791","pubdate":"2013-01-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e54080","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Mismatch Negativity and Cognitive Performance for the Prediction of Psychosis in Subjects with At-Risk Mental State","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mismatch-negativity-cognitive-performance-prediction-psychosis-subjects-atrisk-mental-state"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8220311,"mean":6.9633572845728,"rank":2095983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5001577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8220311,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":300024,"mean":6.891991387327,"rank":86867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":204170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":300024,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114008,"mean":10.57921246941,"rank":38086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":73052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114008,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6354,"mean":8.6014796159295,"rank":1933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":4326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6354,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
