The genome is 16,626 bp in length, including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and 1 control region. Its gene arrangement and translation direction were identical to those of other typical vertebrates. The overall base composition is 30.7% A, 27.9% C, 16.7% G and 24.7% T, with the negative GC skew value ( - 0.251). In a long term, S. macrops was confused with Sinibrama wui, which was confirmed as an invalid species by recent morphological study. Therefore, the mitochondrial genome of S. macrops can contribute to the molecular identification of the species and further phylogenetic study of Cyprinidae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Weiming Ai","Xiao Chen","Dan Xiang","Yunyun Chen","Shaobo Chen"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2012.752475","first_seen_on":"2013-01-19T04:20:36+00:00","issns":["1940-1736","1940-1744"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1358569230,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2012.752475","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2012.752475?ai=1p04&mi=3e34ke&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=MDN&"],"pmid":"23327444","pubdate":"2013-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"130118022328001","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Complete mitochondrial genome of the Sinibrama macrops (Cyprinidae: Cultrinae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-mitochondrial-genome-sinibrama-macrops-cyprinidae-cultrinae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":2904870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280501,"mean":5.7809236720142,"rank":224418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280501,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":0.62233898305085,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":0.28088235294118,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/statuses\/292486669364494336","license":"public","citation_ids":[1185677],"posted_on":"2013-01-19T04:20:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"292486669364494336"}]}}
