Since the analyst's functions as facilitator and as internal object (often an obstacle to the patient's expressiveness) are sometimes in conflict with one another, it is important for the analyst to be able to work internally with this conflict as he works with his patient. Splitting processes between these two functions may provide the analyst with cues related to the patient's and the analyst's resistance to understanding the patient's communication of unconscious conflict and the patient's recruitment of the analyst into the patient's internalized world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079a0","authors":["Cooper S"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1745-8315.2012.00608.x","first_seen_on":"2013-01-18T11:13:13+00:00","issns":["0020-7578"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal of Psychoanalysis","last_mentioned_on":1358507582,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22900555?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22900555","pubdate":"2012-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Exploring a patient's shift from relative silence to verbal expressiveness: Observations on an element of the analyst's participation.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-patients-shift-relative-silence-verbal-expressiveness-observations-element-analysts-partic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":2310958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1579010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284971,"mean":5.972597789241,"rank":145252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":100974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284971,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":2.1514579439252,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.9909090909091,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
