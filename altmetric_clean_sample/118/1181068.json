METHODS: A group of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were interviewed and were asked about the period from first onset of symptoms to first medical consultation to indicate patient delay. This was studied in relation to patients' age, educational level, marital status, family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease, number of children and the nature of the first symptom seen. RESULTS: In all, 190 breast cancer patients were interviewed. Of these, 75% presented to physician within 3 months. Forty-two patients (25%) delayed more than 3 months. In multivariate regression analysis it was found that there was a risk for longer delay in widowed or divorced women (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.5-9.7), women with a positive family history of breast cancer (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.7), and less educated patients (illiterate: OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.5-17.7; primary schooling: OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.4-14.7). Significant associations also were found between delay presentation and the late stage disease (P = 0.01) and bigger tumor size (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that one in four women with breast cancer present late and this has significant effect on their disease prognosis. To reduce patient delay health education programs regarding breast cancer should be implemented and target women who are at higher risk of delay.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007dd","authors":["Montazeri, Ali","Ebrahimi, Mandana","Mehrdad, Neda","Ansari, Mariam","Sajadian, Akram","Ali Montazeri","Mandana Ebrahimi","Neda Mehrdad","Mariam Ansari","Akram Sajadian"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6874-3-4","first_seen_on":"2013-01-17T08:36:39+00:00","issns":["1472-6874","14726874"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1463506159,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6874\/3\/4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC166160\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1472-6874-3-4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12846932","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC166160"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/bmcwomenshealth\/content\/pdf\/1472-6874-3-4.pdf","pmcid":"PMC166160","pmid":"12846932","pubdate":"2003-07-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"4","title":"Delayed presentation in breast cancer: a study in Iranian women","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delayed-presentation-breast-cancer-study-iranian-women-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":1606198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6052324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":296799,"mean":6.6405078942578,"rank":70394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":224837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":296799,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":4.1265149425287,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.378,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
