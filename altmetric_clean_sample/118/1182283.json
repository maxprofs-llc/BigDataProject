We generated a transgenic medaka fish in which the lymphatic vessels and some blood vessels are visible in vivo by transferring the promoter of medaka flt4 driving the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) using a see-through medaka line. To do this, we identified and cloned medaka flt4 and generated a construct in which the promoter was the 4-kb region upstream of the translation initiation site. The fluorescent signal of EGFP could be observed with little background, and the expression pattern correlated well with that of flt4 determined by whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization. Because a see-through medaka line is transparent until adult, the model is useful for visualizing the lymphatic vessels not only in embryo and fry but also in adult. This model will be a useful tool for analyzing lymphatic development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751b","authors":["Deguchi T","Fujimori KE","Kawasaki T","Maruyama K","Yuba S"],"doi":"10.1002\/dvg.22018","first_seen_on":"2013-01-17T17:00:58+00:00","issns":["1526-954X"],"issue":"","journal":"Genesis: The Journal of Genetics and Development","last_mentioned_on":1358442050,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22334443?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22334443","pubdate":"2012-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"In vivo visualization of the lymphatic vessels in pFLT4-EGFP transgenic medaka.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-visualization-lymphatic-vessels-pflt4egfp-transgenic-medaka"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4202403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288991,"mean":6.2014966607839,"rank":238818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288991,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":2.5121605839416,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.78125,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
