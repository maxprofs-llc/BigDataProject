However, in a variety of tumor cells, B7-H4 was detected predominantly in intracellular compartments with unknown mechanism and functions. In this study, we analyzed B7-H4 expression and subcellular distribution by immunohistochemistry in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues. B7-H4 protein was detected on the membrane, in the cytosol and\/or in the nucleus in tumor tissues. The membrane and nuclear expression of B7-H4 was significantly correlated with the tumor stages of RCC. Moreover, the membrane localization of B7-H4 was inversely correlated with the intensity of tumor infiltrates lymphocyte (TILs), whereas no association was observed between nuclear expression of B7-H4 and the density of TILs status. We further identified that B7-H4 is a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein containing a functional nuclear localization sequence (NLS) motif. A point mutation of B7-H4 NLS motif blocked the leptomycin B -induced nuclear accumulation of B7-H4. HEK293 cells stably expressing B7-H4 NLS mutant exhibited more potent inhibition in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production through increasing its surface expression compared with wild-type B7-H4 transfected cells owing to their increased surface expression. Most importantly, overexpression of wild-type B7-H4 in HEK293 cells enhanced tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, promoted G1\/S phase transition. The regulation of cell cycle by wild-type B7-H4 was partialy due to upregulation of Cyclin D 1 and Cyclin E. A mutation of B7-H4 NLS motif abolished the B7-H4-mediated cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. Furthermore, B7-H4 wild-type confers chemoresistance activity to RCC cell lines including Caki-1 and ACHN. Our study provides a new insight into the functional implication of B7-H4 in its subcellular localization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","doi":"10.1038\/onc.2012.600","first_seen_on":"2013-01-17T23:25:43+00:00","issns":["1476-5594"],"journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1358465134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23318460?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"23318460","pubdate":"2013-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"The costimulatory molecule B7-H4 promote tumor progression and cell proliferation through translocating into nucleus.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costimulatory-molecule-b7h4-promote-tumor-progression-cell-proliferation-through-translocating-nucle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284844,"mean":5.9664814160784,"rank":195862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":56378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284844,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3688,"mean":2.6105473284513,"rank":2662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3688,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.3857037037037,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
