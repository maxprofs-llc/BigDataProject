The accepted proton pumping stoichiometry was 4 protons per 2 electrons transferred (4H(+)\/2e(-)) but it has been suggested that stoichiometry may be 3H(+)\/2e(-) based on the identification of only 3 proton pumping units in the crystal structure and a revision of the previous experimental data. Measurement of proton pumping stoichiometry is challenging because, even in isolated mitochondria, it is difficult to measure the proton motive force while simultaneously measuring the redox potentials of the NADH\/NAD(+) and ubiquinol\/ubiquinone pools. Here we employ a new method to quantify the proton motive force in living cells from the redox poise of the bc(1) complex measured using multiwavelength cell spectroscopy and show that the correct stoichiometry for complex I is 4H(+)\/2e(-) in mouse and human cells at high and physiological proton motive force.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Roger Springett"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m112.438945","first_seen_on":"2013-01-16T23:10:22+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1358377818,"links":["http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/10\/jbc.M112.438945.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/10\/jbc.M112.438945.full.pdf","pmid":"23306206","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mammalian Complex I pumps 4 protons per 2 electrons at high and physiological proton motive force in living cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mammalian-complex-i-pumps-4-protons-per-2-electrons-high-physiological-proton-motive-force-living-ce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284859,"mean":5.9783539307303,"rank":192787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":54070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284859,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30238,"mean":2.4916665674505,"rank":23213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":5532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30238,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1576,"mean":2.6963923809524,"rank":1072,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1576,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
