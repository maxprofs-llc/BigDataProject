None of the 55 samples contained these phages at concentrations greater than 10 g(-1) (the limit of detection). Spiking and recovery experiments indicated that the method was efficient at detecting coliphage T4 added to the food, and so it was concluded that phage titres were not being falsely underestimated. In addition 51 samples of chicken skin from retail portions were tested for the presence and numbers of coliphages and for presence only of Campylobacter jejuni phages. Coliphages were isolated from 46 samples (90.2% positive), at up to 2570 PFU 10 g sample(-1) but no C. jejuni phages were isolated. Several other methods were used to isolate C. jejuni phages from retail chicken but none was successful. However, when pooled whole chicken rinses from 39 flocks were tested for the presence of C. jejuni phages, 11 (28.2%) of the flocks were positive. It is possible that phages present on birds at the start of processing were either inactivated or simply diluted out during spin chilling. These data add to the body of information indicating that phages can readily be isolated from certain foods and indicate that consumers are exposed to them on a regular basis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Tsuei AC","Carey-Smith GV","Hudson JA","Billington C","Heinemann JA"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.12.028","first_seen_on":"2013-01-17T15:17:08+00:00","issns":["0168-1605","01681605"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1358434213,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016816050700058X"],"pmid":"17276534","pubdate":"2007-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Prevalence and numbers of coliphages and Campylobacter jejuni bacteriophages in New Zealand foods ","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-numbers-coliphages-campylobacter-jejuni-bacteriophages-new-zealand-foods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632209,"mean":4.9245852853192,"rank":2898286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632209,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280282,"mean":5.7517510427036,"rank":223504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":756,"mean":2.121901986755,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":756,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.71375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
