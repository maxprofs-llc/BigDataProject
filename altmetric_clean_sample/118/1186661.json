The method was used to select homes for ethnographic and water quality research in a region of rural Haiti located within 9 km of a local hospital and source of health education in Deschapelles, Haiti. The technique does not require access to governmental records or ground based surveys to collect household location data and can be performed in a rapid, cost-effective manner.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000083b","authors":["Peter J Wampler","Peter J Wampler","Richard R Rediske","Azizur R Molla"],"doi":"10.1186\/1476-072x-12-3","first_seen_on":"2013-01-19T21:05:55+00:00","issns":["1476-072X"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Health Geographics","last_mentioned_on":1448993796,"links":["http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/12\/1\/3\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/12\/1\/3","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1476-072X-12-3","http:\/\/ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1476-072X-12-3"],"pmid":"23331997","pubdate":"2013-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Geography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Business, Management and Accounting","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["publichealth","epidemiology"],"title":"Using ArcMap, Google Earth, and Global Positioning Systems to select and locate random households in rural Haiti","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-arcmap-google-earth-global-positioning-systems-select-locate-random-households-rural-haiti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6632903,"mean":6.1476115477016,"rank":2288622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4294460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6632903,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":293097,"mean":6.4920730340911,"rank":92299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":198048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":293097,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":4.7550290697674,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":3.3985,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
