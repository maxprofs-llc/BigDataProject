Antioxidant activity was assessed by oxidation of the aliphatic aldehyde hexanal to the carboxylic acid. The lowest and highest antioxidant activities were exhibited by grapefruit and clove bud essential oils, respectively. Mixtures containing clove bud essential oil also strongly inhibited oxidation of hexanal. Changes in the composition of essential oils and their mixtures in the course of long-term storage in the light were studied. The stability of components of lemon and coriander essential oils in mixtures increased compared to individual essential oils.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce55","authors":["Misharina, T A","Samusenko, A L"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-19T05:31:08+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0555-1099"],"issue":"4","journal":"Prikladnaia biokhimiia i mikrobiologiia","last_mentioned_on":1358573458,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18924419"],"pmid":"18924419","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"[Antioxidant properties of essential oils from lemon, grapefruit, coriander, clove, and their mixtures].","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioxidant-properties-essential-oils-lemon-grapefruit-coriander-clove-mixtures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2930640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1430734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285138,"mean":5.9869809039163,"rank":181921,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":91307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285138,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":0.90172413793103,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
