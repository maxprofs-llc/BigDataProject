The mechanisms that link actin alterations to the autoimmune phenotype are still poorly understood. We show that chronic activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and elevated type-I interferon (IFN) levels play a role in WAS autoimmunity. WAS patients display increased expression of type-I IFN genes and their inducible targets, alteration in pDCs numbers, and hyperresponsiveness to TLR9. Importantly, ablating IFN-I signaling in WASp null mice rescued chronic activation of conventional DCs, splenomegaly, and colitis. Using WASp-deficient mice, we demonstrated that WASp null pDCs are intrinsically more responsive to multimeric agonist of TLR9 and constitutively secrete type-I IFN but become progressively tolerant to further stimulation. By acute silencing of WASp and actin inhibitors, we show that WASp-mediated actin polymerization controls intracellular trafficking and compartmentalization of TLR9 ligands in pDCs restraining exaggerated activation of the TLR9-IFN-\u03b1 pathway. Together, these data highlight the role of actin dynamics in pDC innate functions and imply the pDC-IFN-\u03b1 axis as a player in the onset of autoimmune phenomena in WAS disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Federica Benvenuti"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20120363","first_seen_on":"2013-01-22T11:37:36+00:00","funders":["mrc","nhlbi"],"issns":["1540-9538"],"journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1374568101,"links":["http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/15\/jem.20120363"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/15\/jem.20120363.full.pdf","pmid":"23337808","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein\u2013mediated actin dynamics control type-I interferon production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wiskottaldrich-syndrome-proteinmediated-actin-dynamics-control-typei-interferon-production-plasmacyt-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":2737980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3327437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270357,"mean":6.7100928331535,"rank":123189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":137638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270357,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3006,"mean":5.5940053244592,"rank":1724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3006,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":6.7213552631579,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
