Intracellular \u03b2-catenin, through interaction with other proteins, has been reported to be able to regulate the size of cutaneous wounds. Higher expression of \u03b2-catenin is associated with larger sized wounds. However, the identification of serum \u03b2-catenin complex is difficult and has been rarely reported. The exploitation of more binding partners can contribute to uncovering the exact mechanisms behind serum \u03b2-catenin mediated biological effects. Here, we describe a method that consists of immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion, and nanoLC coupled to LCMS-IT-TOF for the investigation of serum \u03b2-catenin complex in mice scald model. Among selected gel bands obtained from the protein gels, a total of 31 peptides were identified and sequenced with high statistical significance (p<0.01). Three proteins (alpha-2-marcoglobulin, serine protease inhibitor A3K, and serine protease inhibitor A1A) were identified and validated with high reliability and high reproducibility. It was inferred that these proteins might interact with serum \u03b2-catenin, which could affect the wound healing resulting from burn shock. Our study demonstrated that the on-line coupling of nano-LC with a LCMS-IT-TOF mass spectrometer was capable of sensitive and automated characterization of the serum \u03b2-catenin complex in mice scald model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Cheng-cai Huang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0046530","first_seen_on":"2013-01-21T21:55:26+00:00","issns":["","1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1358868103,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0046530"],"pmid":"23056334","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Application of On-Line nanoLC-IT-TOF in the Identification of Serum \u03b2-Catenin Complex in Mice Scald Model","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-online-nanolcittof-identification-serum-catenin-complex-mice-scald-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":1635810,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1940426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280704,"mean":5.7904992180346,"rank":108467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":167317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280704,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64072,"mean":8.2946541805186,"rank":26433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":36963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64072,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6464,"mean":6.7079183041931,"rank":2341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6464,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
