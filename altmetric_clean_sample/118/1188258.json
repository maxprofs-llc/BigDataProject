Both clones originated from the same virus isolation, but the virus used to clone DxS was propagated extensively in a host of a different family prior to cloning whereas that used to clone x4 was not. Differences in the amino acid sequence inferred from the DNA sequences occurred in two clusters. An N-terminal conserved region preceded two regions of variation separated by a central conserved region. Variation in cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) gene VI sequences, all of which were derived from virus isolates from hosts from one host family, was similar to that seen in the FMV comparison, though the extent of variation was less. Alignment of gene VI domains from FMV and CaMV revealed regions of amino acid sequence identical in both viruses within the conserved regions. The similarity in the pattern of conserved and variable domains of these two viruses suggests common host-interactive functions in caulimovirus gene VI homologues, and possibly an analogy between caulimoviruses and certain animal viruses in the influence of the host on sequence variability of viral genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003769","authors":["Sanger, M","Daubert, S","Goodman, R M"],"first_seen_on":"2013-01-21T09:17:58+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0042-6822"],"issue":"2","journal":"Virology","last_mentioned_on":1358759265,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2024500"],"pmid":"2024500","pubdate":"1991-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"The regions of sequence variation in caulimovirus gene VI.","type":"article","volume":"182","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regions-sequence-variation-caulimovirus-gene-vi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2670061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289461,"mean":6.2278505492985,"rank":143367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":113626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289461,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1669,"mean":3.2901810551559,"rank":1031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1669,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.1418666666667,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Ph.D. Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/MadeleineLove\/status\/293283732071264256","citation_ids":[1188258],"posted_on":"2013-01-21T09:07:45+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"MadeleineLove","tweeter_id":"21707930"},"tweet_id":"293283732071264256"}]}}
