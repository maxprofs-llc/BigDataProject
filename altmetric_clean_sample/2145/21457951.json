The Demographic and Health Surveys of 1989, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2009 were used to investigate trends over time, and factors associated with single motherhood in Kenya. Urban residence, older age, and poorer economic status were associated with single motherhood over time. Women with more than one child, and those with children under 15\u00a0years living at home, were less likely to be single mothers. As women become single mothers at different stages, targeted and supportive strategies are required to mitigate associated risks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000147f","authors":["Stella K.
