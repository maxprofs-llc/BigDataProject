Here, the use of cadmium ions as a suitable anomalous scatterer at the standard wavelength of 1\u2005\u00c5 is demonstrated. The structures of three different proteins were determined using cadmium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing. Owing to the strong anomalous signal, the structure of lysozyme could be automatically phased and built using a very low anomalous multiplicity (1.1) and low-completeness (77%) data set. Additionally, it is shown that cadmium ions can easily substitute divalent ions in ATP-divalent cation complexes. This property could be generally applied for phasing experiments of a wide range of nucleotide-binding proteins. Improvements in crystal growth and quality, good anomalous signal at standard wavelengths (i.e. no need to change photon energy) and rapid phasing and refinement using a single data set are benefits that should allow cadmium ions to be widely used for experimental phasing.","authors":["Panneerselvam, S.","Kumpula, E.-P.","Kursula, I.","Burkhardt, A.","Meents, A.","Panneerselvam, S.","Kumpula, E.-P.","Kursula, I.","Burkhardt, A.","Meents, A.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2059798317006970","first_seen_on":"2017-07-01T00:00:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2059-7983"],"issue":"Pt 7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1505315283,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2059798317006970"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/d\/issues\/2017\/07\/00\/di5009\/di5009.pdf","pmid":"28695858","pubdate":"2017-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Rapid cadmium SAD phasing at the standard wavelength (1\u2005\u00c5)","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-cadmium-sad-phasing-standard-wavelength-1-%C3%A5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
