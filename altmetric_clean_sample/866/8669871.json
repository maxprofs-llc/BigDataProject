Their detailed histories were recorded and cutaneous and systemic examinations were performed. Patch testing was done in all the patients and photo-patch testing was carried out in 86 patients.\nAltogether 101 patients were included (69 males, 32 females). The most common presentation was lichenified hyperpigmented plaques on the photo-exposed sites. Photosensitivity was recorded in 64 (63%) patients and summer exacerbation in 52 (52%). Exposure to the Parthenium hysterophorus weed was recorded in 70 (69%) patients, 27 (26.7%) had a history of hair dye application and 20 (20%) had a history of atopy. Photo-patch test was positive in 11 (12.8%) patients and patch testing was positive in 71 (70%). Parthenium hysterophorus was the most common allergen implicated and was positive in three (4%) photo-patch and 52 (52%) patch tests. Other positive photo-patch test allergens were perfume mix, balsam of Peru, thiuram mix, Compositae mix and promethazine hydrochloride. Other common patch test allergens were parthenolide, colophony, fragrance mix and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) base.\nIn the Indian population parthenium and perfume mix are the most common photoallergens in patients with dermatitis over photo-exposed areas, while parthenium, colophony, fragrance mix and PPD are the common positive allergens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002358","authors":["Sharma, Vinod Kumar","Bhari, Neetu","Wadhwani, Ashok Roopchand","Bhatia, Riti"],"doi":"10.1111\/ajd.12504","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T15:38:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-0960"],"journal":"Australasian Journal of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1465645636,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajd.12504\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajd.12504\/pdf","pmid":"27282531","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Photo-patch and patch tests in patients with dermatitis over the photo-exposed areas: A study of 101 cases from a tertiary care centre in India","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/photopatch-patch-tests-patients-dermatitis-photoexposed-areas-study-101-cases-tertiary-care-centre-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267965,"mean":11.413994782881,"rank":223361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267965,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":3.3884078212291,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.1944444444444,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Chimienaturels\/statuses\/741597667508244480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8669871],"posted_on":"2016-06-11T11:47:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Ga\u00eblle Queignec","url":"https:\/\/fr.linkedin.com\/in\/gaellequeignec","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793009376206487552\/OVI-EP8s_normal.jpg","description":"Enchant\u00e9s par #cosm\u00e9tiques #cosmetics #parfums #ingredients  #biotech #chimie  ?Partageons inspirations #innovations #veille  #r\u00e9glementations Compte personnel","id_on_source":"Chimienaturels","tweeter_id":"40194332","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":602},"tweet_id":"741597667508244480"}]}}
