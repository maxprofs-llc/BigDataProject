DEVD-S-DOX, DOX linked to a peptide moiety (DEVD), is a prodrug that is cleaved into free DOX by caspase-3 upon apoptosis. DEVD-S-DOX has no therapeutic efficacy, but it changes into free DOX with the expression of caspase-3. With the accumulation of the composite NPs in the tumor tissue by the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, a small exposure of DOX in the tumor cells initiated apoptosis in a localized area of the tumor tissue, which induced caspase-3 activation. Cleavage of DEVD-S-DOX into free DOX by caspase-3 continued with repetitive activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DEVD-S-DOX at the tumor site. The composite NPs were characterized with transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) and particle size analyzer. We then evaluated the nanoparticle drug release, therapeutic efficacy, and in\u00a0vivo biodistribution for tumor targeting using a non-invasive live animal imaging technology and the quantification of DOX with high performance liquid chromatography. DOX-induced apoptosis-targeted chemotherapy (DIATC) was verified by in\u00a0vitro\/in\u00a0vivo DEVD-S-DOX response to free DOX and cellular uptake behavior of the composite NPs with flow cytometry analysis. Significant antitumor efficacy with minimal cardiotoxicity was also observed, which supported DIATC for improved chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Khaliq, Nisar Ul","Sandra, Febrina Carolina","Park, Dal Yong","Lee, Jae Young","Oh, Keun Sang","Kim, Dongkyu","Byun, Youngro","Kim, In-San","Kwon, Ick Chan","Kim, Sang Yoon","Yuk, Soon Hong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2016.05.056","endpage":"142","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T13:33:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5905","01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1465639391,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27286189?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27286189","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"131","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Doxorubicin\/heparin composite nanoparticles for caspase-activated prodrug chemotherapy","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/doxorubicinheparin-composite-nanoparticles-caspaseactivated-prodrug-chemotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":6824852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267966,"mean":11.414009657977,"rank":223383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267966,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2336,"mean":6.4856496788009,"rank":1768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2336,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":6.1362173913043,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
