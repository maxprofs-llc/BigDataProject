We utilized a novel methodology among individuals with ASD and matched controls, combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG) recording (TMS-EEG) to explore cortical function and connectivity in three sites implicated in the neuropathophysiology of ASD (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, and temporoparietal junction). As there is evidence for neurobiological gender differences in ASD, we also examined the influence of biological sex.\nTMS pulses were applied to each of the three sites (right lateralized) during 20-channel EEG recording.\nWe did not identify any differences in the EEG response to TMS between ASD and control groups. This finding remained when data were stratified by sex. Nevertheless, traits and characteristics associated with ASD were correlated with the neurophysiological response to TMS.\nWhile TMS-EEG did not appear to clarify the neuropathophysiology of ASD, the relationships identified between the neurophysiological response to TMS and clinical characteristics warrant further investigation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf1","authors":["KirkovskiMelissa"],"doi":"10.1089\/cap.2015.0181","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T10:00:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1044-5463","1557-8992"],"journal":"Journal of Child & Adolescent Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1465964684,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/cap.2015.0181"],"pmid":"27284688","pubdate":"2016-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","pediatrics"],"title":"Single Pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Electroencephalogram Reveals No Electrophysiological Abnormality in Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-pulse-transcranial-magnetic-stimulationelectroencephalogram-reveals-electrophysiological-abno"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7969435,"mean":6.7304812193633,"rank":3108836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4835006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7969435,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268875,"mean":11.426373431421,"rank":92163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":175273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268875,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":6.7932567049808,"rank":206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":11.952833333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
