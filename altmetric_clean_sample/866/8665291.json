We investigated whether increased water consumption replaced sugar-containing beverages and whether changes in water or sugar-containing beverages influenced body weight outcomes. In a secondary analysis of the intervention study in Germany, we analysed combined longitudinal data from the intervention and control groups. Body weight and height were measured and beverage consumption was self-reported by a 24-h recall questionnaire at the beginning and end of the school year 2006\/2007. The effect of a change in water consumption on change in sugar-containing beverage (soft drinks and juices) consumption, change in BMI (kg\/m2) and prevalence of overweight and obesity at follow-up was analysed using regression analyses. Of 3220 enroled children, 1987 children (mean age 8\u00b73 (sd 0\u00b77) years) from thirty-two schools were analysed. Increased water consumption by 1 glass\/d was associated with a reduced consumption of sugar-containing beverages by 0\u00b712 glasses\/d (95 % CI -0\u00b716, -0\u00b708) but was not associated with changes in BMI (P=0\u00b763). Increased consumption of sugar-containing beverages by 1 glass\/d was associated with an increased BMI by 0\u00b702 (95 % CI 0\u00b700, 0\u00b703) kg\/m2 and increased prevalence of obesity (OR 1\u00b722; 95 % CI 1\u00b704, 1\u00b744) but not with overweight (P=0\u00b783). In conclusion, an increase in water consumption can replace sugar-containing beverages. As sugar-containing beverages were associated with weight gain, this replacement might explain the prevention of obesity through the promotion of water consumption.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Rebecca\u00a0Muckelbauer","Steven L.\u00a0Gortmaker","Lars\u00a0Libuda","Mathilde\u00a0Kersting","Kerstin\u00a0Clausen","Bettina\u00a0Adelberger","Jacqueline\u00a0M\u00fcller-Nordhorn","Muckelbauer, Rebecca","Gortmaker, Steven L","Libuda, Lars","Kersting, Mathilde","Clausen, Kerstin","Adelberger, Bettina","M\u00fcller-Nordhorn, Jacqueline"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007114516001136","endpage":"2066","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T12:31:39+00:00","issns":["1475-2662","0007-1145"],"issue":"11","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1494422764,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/S0007114516001136","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27040694"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0007114516001136","pmid":"27040694","pubdate":"2016-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"2057","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Changes in water and sugar-containing beverage consumption and body weight outcomes in children","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-water-sugarcontaining-beverage-consumption-body-weight-outcomes-children-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":3290457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4867564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270346,"mean":11.561757776174,"rank":95483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":173384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270346,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3552,"mean":12.352733877781,"rank":2223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3552,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":12.548829268293,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=631628226992613&id=152534768235297","license":"public","citation_ids":[8665291],"posted_on":"2016-06-10T10:32:04+00:00","summary":"De l'EAU pour perdre du poids ?\n\nVous ne perdez pas du poids directement gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'eau que vous consommez, mais bien parce que vous buvez DE L'EAU A LA PLACE DES BOISSONS SUCR\u00c9ES.
