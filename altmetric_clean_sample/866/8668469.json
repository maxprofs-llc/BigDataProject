However, how mitotic spindles sense and control their size, position and movement inside the cell still remains unclear. In this paper, we focus on the size effects of mitotic spindles, i.e., how cell size controls various interesting phenomena in the metaphase, such as oscillation, positioning and size limit of mitotic spindles. We systematically studied the frequency doubling phenomenon during chromosome oscillation and found that cell size can regulate the period and amplitude of chromosome oscillation. We found that the relaxation time of the positioning process increases exponentially with cell size. We also showed that the stabler microtubule-kinetochore attachments alone can directly lead to an upper limit of spindle size. Our work not only explains the existing experimental observations, but also provides some interesting predictions that can be verified or rejected by further experiments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jiang, Hongyuan"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep10504","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T14:08:12+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1465641440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26015263?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26015263"],"pmid":"26015263","pubdate":"2015-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Computational biophysics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"10504","subjects":["science"],"title":"Cell Size Modulates Oscillation, Positioning and Length of Mitotic Spindles","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-size-modulates-oscillation-positioning-length-mitotic-spindles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":5977216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1056697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267966,"mean":11.413982229022,"rank":187315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267966,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31263,"mean":14.950462478408,"rank":23011,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31263,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3167,"mean":15.004842072015,"rank":2274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3167,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
