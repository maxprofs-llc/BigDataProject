It is unknown, however, if MAP is equally challenged during the post-exercise period, and whether regular endurance exercise training can provide any benefit to its regulation. We examined MAP (Finometer) in eight trained (T) and eight untrained (UT) individuals prior to, and following, 120\u2009min of cycling at 42\u2009\u00b0C with (HYD) and without (DEHY) fluid replacement. Exercise during DEHY induced significant hyperthermia (T: 39.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52\u2009\u00b0C vs UT: 38.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u2009\u00b0C, P\u2009=\u20090.941) and body weight losses (T: 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2% vs UT: 2.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9%, P\u2009=\u20090.332), which did not differ between groups. Although MAP was equally reduced 5\u2009min into the post-exercise period of DEHY (T: -20\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u2009mmHg vs UT: -22\u2009\u00b1\u200913\u2009mmHg, P\u2009=\u20090.800), its subsequent recovery was significantly different between groups (P\u2009=\u20090.037). While MAP returned to pre-exercise values in UT (-1\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mmHg), it remained reduced in T (-9\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u2009mmHg, P\u2009=\u20090.028). No differences in MAP post-exercise were observed between groups during HYD. These data suggest that trained men exhibit a greater level of post-exercise hypotension following prolonged exercise in the heat without fluid replacement. Furthermore, fluid replacement reverses the sustained post-exercise hypotension observed in trained individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c5","authors":["Gagnon, D.","Lynn, A.
