We structurally characterized the hexanuclear clusters, and their magnetic properties have been fully analyzed. DFT calculations have been performed as a supplementary tool. All results evidence a weak antiferromagnetic interaction through the bridging ligands between isolated spin ground states arising from intra-Fe(2)MO core exchange couplings. Together with the pioneer 2,2'-bipyrimidine bridged systems, the new complexes reported constitute a family of complexes where the exchange interaction can be tuned by the selection of the bridging LL type ligand.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Pablo Albor\u00e9s","Christian Plenk","Eva Rentschler"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300911j","first_seen_on":"2012-07-25T21:48:58+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1343252882,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic300911j"],"pmid":"22830386","pubdate":"2012-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120725104642007","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tailoring the Exchange Interaction in Covalently Linked Basic Carboxylate Clusters through Bridging Ligand Selection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tailoring-exchange-interaction-covalently-linked-basic-carboxylate-clusters-through-bridging-ligand"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3531506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75384,"mean":5.259678442089,"rank":58043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75384,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.5816162054018,"rank":5319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":336,"mean":1.085223880597,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":336,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":8}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/228245247757545472","license":"public","citation_ids":[856651],"posted_on":"2012-07-25T21:48:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"228245247757545472"}]}}
