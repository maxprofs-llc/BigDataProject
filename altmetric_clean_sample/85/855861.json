However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input\/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a65","authors":["Y. Bengio","P.
