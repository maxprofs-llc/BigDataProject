We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who developed severe aortic insufficiency after insertion of a 5-L Impella device 16 weeks after heart transplantation. After joint evaluation by the transcatheter valve team, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was planned because of associated comorbid conditions. A 29-mm CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was inserted percutaneously. At 6 months after prosthesis implantation, the patient was asymptomatic in New York Heart Association functional class II, and the echocardiogram showed a mean transvalvular gradient of 1 mm Hg, an aortic valve area of 1.5 cm2, and no paravalvular aortic insufficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Chandola R","Cusimano R","Osten M","Horlick E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2011.12.025","first_seen_on":"2012-07-27T10:12:10+00:00","issns":["0003-4975"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1343383862,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22632535?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22632535","pubdate":"2012-05-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Postcardiac transplant transcatheter core valve implantation for aortic insufficiency secondary to impella device placement.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postcardiac-transplant-transcatheter-core-valve-implantation-aortic-insufficiency-secondary-impella"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":2897936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72179,"mean":4.9676602565878,"rank":52946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72179,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1682,"mean":1.6771409875074,"rank":814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1682,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":0.609375,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
