We describe a generative probabilistic model that composites the output of a bank of object detectors in order to define shape masks and explain the appearance, depth ordering, and labels of all pixels in an image. Notably, our system estimates both class labels and object instance labels. Building on previous benchmark criteria for object detection and image segmentation, we define a novel score that evaluates both class and instance segmentation. We evaluate our system on the PASCAL 2009 and 2010 segmentation challenge data sets and show good test results with state-of-the-art performance in several categories, including segmenting humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a67","authors":["Yang Y","Hallman S","Ramanan D","Fowlkes CC"],"doi":"10.1109\/tpami.2011.208","endpage":"1743","first_seen_on":"2012-07-21T13:34:19+00:00","issns":["1939-3539","0162-8828","2160-9292"],"issue":"9","journal":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","last_mentioned_on":1342877627,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22813957?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m&tool=cdl&otool=cdlotool"],"pmid":"22813957","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IEEE","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer Software","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Computer Science"],"startpage":"1731","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Layered object models for image segmentation.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/layered-object-models-image-segmentation-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6959674,"mean":6.2323251402732,"rank":5197000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":989700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6959674,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90398,"mean":5.5106183169796,"rank":58488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90398,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1263,"mean":1.7970491283677,"rank":844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1263,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.95454545454545,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
