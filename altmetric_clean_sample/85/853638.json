The current study was designed to evaluate the awareness and skills of orthopedic surgeons (OS) regarding FMS diagnosis and treatment. For the examination of awareness and familiarity of OS in Israel to Fibromyalgia, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted. Two hundred and nineteen OS, residents and specialists, were asked anonymously about awareness, knowledge, and treatment of FM. Multivariable statistical analysis was performed. 91 % (199) of responders reported that they recognized the disease. Notwithstanding, the mean knowledge score was 7.6 out of 17. In addition, OS who were trained in the south of Israel were found to have a better degree of knowledge about FM (9.7 vs. 7.4; p < 0.03). The awareness and knowledge among OS regarding FM needs to be improved. OS who were trained in the south of Israel were found to have better degree of knowledge regarding FM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000349a","doi":"10.1007\/s00296-012-2488-z","first_seen_on":"2012-07-24T10:02:42+00:00","issns":["1437-160X"],"journal":"Rheumatology International","last_mentioned_on":1365459906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22821335?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22821335","pubdate":"2012-07-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Awareness of diagnostic and clinical features of fibromyalgia among orthopedic surgeons.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/awareness-diagnostic-clinical-features-fibromyalgia-among-orthopedic-surgeons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":2216238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3972966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81806,"mean":5.7082940896033,"rank":26830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":54294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81806,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":673,"mean":3.142568452381,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":673,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
