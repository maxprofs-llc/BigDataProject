In this subanalysis study, we compared the prognostic effects of 3 calcium channel blockers (benidipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine) on the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with VSA in our cohort study, where 527 patients (318 men and 209 women) enrolled after 1990 (from January 1990 to December 2002) were followed-up for a mean period of 5.2 years. There was no significant difference in the clinical characteristics among the 3 calcium channel blocker groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that 4 factors, including smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, were significant risk factors for cardiovascular events. Among the 3 calcium channel blockers examined, benidipine (n = 148) tended to be associated with a lower incidence of total events, cardiovascular events, and cerebral infarction, compared with diltiazem (n = 313) and amlodipine (n = 111). Furthermore, benidipine significantly reduced the incidence of vascular infarction events, a possible indicator of atherosclerosis, as compared with diltiazem. These results suggest that benidipine may be more useful for the treatment of VSA as compared with diltiazem and amlodipine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bb9","doi":"10.1097\/fjc.0b013e3181624b05","first_seen_on":"2012-07-26T23:57:38+00:00","issns":["0160-2446"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1343347007,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/Fulltext\/2008\/03000\/Prognostic_Effects_of_Benidipine_in_Patients_With.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/cardiovascularpharm\/2008\/03000\/Prognostic_Effects_of_Benidipine_in_Patients_With.6.pdf","pmid":"18356689","pubdate":"2008-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"253","subjects":["pharmacology","cardiology"],"title":"Prognostic Effects of Benidipine in Patients With Vasospastic Angina: Comparison With Diltiazem and Amlodipine","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-effects-benidipine-patients-vasospastic-angina-comparison-diltiazem-amlodipine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107559,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":975328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75143,"mean":5.2747100423198,"rank":48882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75143,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1013,"mean":1.7153300395257,"rank":659,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1013,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
