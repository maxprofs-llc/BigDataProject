We aimed to assess whether genetic variants in SLC1A1 and life stress at onset of the disorder interact and modulate pharmacological resistance in OCD. A single-marker association study of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SLC1A1 genomic region was performed in a sample of 238 OCD patients. For the most strongly associated SNP (rs3087879), one copy of the risk allele increased the probability of higher treatment resistance (odds ratio=2.42; 95% confidence interval=1.39-4.21; P=0.0018), but only in OCD patients without life stress at onset of the disorder. These results suggest a gene-by-environment interaction effect on treatment resistance in OCD and strengthen the existing evidence of the role of the glutamatergic system in the phenomenology of OCD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032de","authors":["E Real","M Gratac|[ograve]|s","J Labad","P Alonso","G Escaram|[iacute]|s","C Segal|[agrave]|s","M Subir|[agrave]|","C L|[oacute]|pez-Sol|[agrave]|","X Estivill","J M Mench|[oacute]|n"],"doi":"10.1038\/tpj.2012.30","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-07-23T05:48:57+00:00","issns":["1470-269X","1473-1150"],"journal":"Pharmacogenomics Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343022502,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/tpj\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/tpj201230a.html"],"pmid":"22776887","pubdate":"2012-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Interaction of SLC1A1 gene variants and life stress on pharmacological resistance in obsessive|[ndash]|compulsive disorder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-slc1a1-gene-variants-life-stress-pharmacological-resistance-obsessivecompulsive-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":974000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75064,"mean":5.2613862488842,"rank":48713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75064,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":2.2418526315789,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.2416666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
