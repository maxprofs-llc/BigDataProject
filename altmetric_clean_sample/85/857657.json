Although new molecular targeting agents against MM have been developed based on the better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis, MM still remains an incurable disease. We previously demonstrated that \u03b2-catenin, a downstream effector in the Wnt pathway, is a potential target in MM using RNA interference in an in vivo experimental mouse model. In this study, we have screened a library of more than 100\u2009000 small-molecule chemical compounds for novel Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitors using a high-throughput transcriptional screening technology. We identified AV-65, which diminished \u03b2-catenin protein levels and T-cell factor transcriptional activity. AV-65 then decreased c-myc, cyclin D1 and survivin expression, resulting in the inhibition of MM cell proliferation through the apoptotic pathway. AV-65 treatment prolonged the survival of MM-bearing mice. These findings indicate that this compound represents a novel and attractive therapeutic agent against MM. This study also illustrates the potential of high-throughput transcriptional screening to identify candidates for anticancer drug discovery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbdb","authors":["H Yao","E Ashihara","J W Strovel","Y Nakagawa","J Kuroda","R Nagao","R Tanaka","A Yokota","M Takeuchi","Y Hayashi","C Shimazaki","M Taniwaki","K Strand","J Padia","H Hirai","S Kimura","T Maekawa"],"doi":"10.1038\/bcj.2011.41","first_seen_on":"2012-07-26T12:37:47+00:00","issns":["2044-5385"],"issue":"11","journal":"Blood Cancer Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343306331,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22829079"],"pmcid":"PMC3256754","pmid":"22829079","pubdate":"2011-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"AV-65, a novel Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signal inhibitor, successfully suppresses progression of multiple myeloma in a mouse model.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/bcj.2011.41","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/av65-novel-wnt%CE%B2catenin-signal-inhibitor-successfully-suppresses-progression-multiple-myeloma-mouse-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419766,"mean":6.4517840672812,"rank":3788372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3605493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419766,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92240,"mean":5.632495148473,"rank":43648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":48120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92240,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265,"mean":4.3148484848485,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
