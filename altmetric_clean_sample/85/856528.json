X-ray crystallographic analyses and UV\/Vis absorption\/fluorescence measurements have revealed that the degree of \u03c0-conjugation, the packing motif, the electron-accepting ability, and the thermal stability of the acenaphtho[c]phosphole \u03c0-systems are finely tunable with the \u03b1-aryl substituents. All the P=O and P=S derivatives exhibited high stability in their electrochemically reduced state. To use this class of arene-fused phosphole \u03c0-systems as n-type semiconducting materials, we evaluated device performances of the bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPV) that consist of poly(3-hexylthiophene), an indene-C(70) bisadduct, and a cathode buffer layer. The insertion of the diarylacenaphtho[c]phosphole P-oxides as the buffer layer was found to improve the power conversion efficiency of the polymer-based OPV devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Matano, Yoshihiro","Saito, Arihiro","Suzuki, Yuto","Miyajima, Tooru","Akiyama, Seiji","Otsubo, Saika","Nakamoto, Emi","Aramaki, Shinji","Imahori, Hiroshi"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201200492","endpage":"2312","first_seen_on":"2012-07-25T19:56:23+00:00","issns":["1861-471X","1861-4728"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343246134,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201200492\/abstract;jsessionid=4771B5A159B6CC66A226C1F7C179557A.d03t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201200492\/pdf","pmid":"22833378","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2305","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":",\u00e2\u0080\u0090Diarylacenaphtho[1,2\u00e2\u0080\u0090c]phosphole P\u00e2\u0080\u0090Oxides: Divergent Synthesis and Application to Cathode Buffer Layers in Organic Photovoltaics","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1%CE%B1diarylacenaphtho12cphosphole-poxides-divergent-synthesis-application-cathode-buffer-layers-organic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6279205,"mean":5.9864315817751,"rank":4643724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":940466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6279205,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82003,"mean":5.7243969659276,"rank":54052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82003,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1211,"mean":1.3661388429752,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1211,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.2668,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
