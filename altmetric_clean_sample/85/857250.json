Synthesis of reduced steviol glycosides was performed using straightforward chemistry and their structures were characterized on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR spectral data and chemical studies. Also, we report herewith the sensory evaluation of all the reduced compounds against their corresponding original steviol glycosides and sucrose for the sweetness property of these molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Indra Prakash"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules17088908","first_seen_on":"2012-07-26T08:53:06+00:00","issns":["1420-3049",""],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1343292734,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/17\/8\/8908"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/17\/8\/8908\/pdf","pmid":"22836210","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Molecular Diversity Preservation International","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Synthesis and Sensory Evaluation of ent-Kaurane Diterpene Glycosides","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-sensory-evaluation-entkaurane-diterpene-glycosides"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282925,"mean":5.0205658482736,"rank":3398059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":123819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282925,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74232,"mean":5.0273516724818,"rank":54737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1428,"mean":1.7168114926419,"rank":572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1428,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.85,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
