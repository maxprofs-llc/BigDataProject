The primary goal is to study the evidence-based medicine (EBM) coverage that SemFYC recommends regional virtual libraries. The regional health virtual libraries were identified and the access provided to health professionals, Internet presence, remote access and resources were studied. The results suggest there is ample coverage in 8 Autonomous Regions. At the top of the list was, Health Sciences Virtual Library of Navarre, the Balearic Islands Health Sciences Virtual Library, and Virtual Library of the Andalusian Public Health System. The present study needs to be extended to the other biomedical sciences, in order to obtain more accurate results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b89","doi":"10.1016\/j.aprim.2012.05.013","first_seen_on":"2012-07-25T10:07:38+00:00","issns":["1578-1275"],"journal":"Atenci\u00f3n Primaria (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1366988904,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22824151?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22824151","pubdate":"2012-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"[Primary care resources available in digital libraries in Spanish Autonomous Regions.]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recursos-bibliogr%C3%A1ficos-para-atenci%C3%B3n-primaria-en-las-bibliotecas-virtuales-salud-las-comunidades-au"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2308138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1586124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75386,"mean":5.3090561782848,"rank":35154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":29905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75386,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":2.5160981595092,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.3416666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Social Sciences":3,"Computer Science":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"CU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RevistaMFSamfyc\/statuses\/327800921381806080","license":"public","citation_ids":[855483],"posted_on":"2013-04-26T15:06:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Revista MFAndalucia","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2159845648\/logo_BUENO_RevistaRGB_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"RevistaMFSamfyc","tweeter_id":"559316806","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":502},"tweet_id":"327800921381806080"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/4MeLOW\/statuses\/228068786924843008","license":"public","citation_ids":[855483],"posted_on":"2012-07-25T10:06:50+00:00","author":{"name":"MeLOW","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/117079728374234431856","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2387653297\/earth_globe_org_normal.jpg","description":"This MeLOW stands for Medical Librarians Of the World, an initiative to discover and explore new Worlds & new ways information can travel, like Google+","id_on_source":"4MeLOW","tweeter_id":"632750407","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":93},"tweet_id":"228068786924843008"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/amango30\/statuses\/327801338731831296","license":"public","rt":["RevistaMFSamfyc"],"citation_ids":[855483],"posted_on":"2013-04-26T15:08:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Antonio Manteca","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000095310075\/e3761435f8f78dcd6c84ed7f7c2c8ac3_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"amango30","tweeter_id":"332317568","geo":{"lt":36.77262,"ln":-4.10045,"country":"ES"},"followers":102},"tweet_id":"327801338731831296"}]}}
