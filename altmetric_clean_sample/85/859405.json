Using a novel approach, we provide evidence for aquaporin facilitated CO\u2082 diffusion. Plant aquaporins obtained from heterologous expression were inserted into triblock copolymer membranes. These were employed to separate a chamber with a solution maintaining high CO\u2082 concentrations from one with depleted CO\u2082 concentrations. CO\u2082 diffusion was detected by measuring the pH change resulting from membrane CO\u2082 diffusion from one chamber to the other. An up to 21 fold increase in diffusion rate was determined. Besides the supply of this proof of principle, we could provide additional arguments in favour of protein facilitated CO\u2082 diffusion to the vivid on-going debate about the principles of membrane gas diffusion in living cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatSR...2E.538U","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Norbert Uehlein","Beate Otto","Adrian Eilingsfeld","Fabian Itel","Wolfgang Meier","Ralf Kaldenhoff"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep00538","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2012-07-27T12:35:00+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1377280816,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2012\/120727\/srep00538\/full\/srep00538.html"],"pmid":"22844579","pubdate":"2012-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Gas-tight triblock-copolymer membranes are converted to CO2 permeable by insertion of plant aquaporins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gastight-triblockcopolymer-membranes-converted-co2-permeable-insertion-plant-aquaporins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77761,"mean":5.6000179269548,"rank":47540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77761,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15809,"mean":13.305467737854,"rank":10844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15809,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":33.172649999999,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
