Patients whose tumour cells express cyclin D2, with the translocation t(4;14) or t(14;16), generally have more proliferative disease and inferior outcomes. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a major regulator of D-type cyclin expression and cell cycle entry. We evaluated the effect of PI3K pathway blockade on cell cycle behaviour in MM cells, investigating differences between cyclin D2- and cyclin D1-expressing tumours. MM cell lines and primary bone marrow CD138(+) MM cells were exposed to the pan-PI3K\/mTOR inhibitor, PI-103, and assessed for cell cycle profiles, [(3)H]-thymidine uptake and cell cycle proteins. We report, in both cell lines and primary MM cells, that PI-103 induced cell cycle arrest with downregulation of cyclin D2 and CDK4\/6 in MM cells expressing cyclin D2 via t(4;14) or t(14;16) translocations. Cells expressing cyclin D1 via t(11;14) were insensitive to PI-103, despite exhibiting inhibition of downstream signalling targets. In primary MM cells, PI-103 enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of anti-MM agents. Treatment paradigms including blockade of the PI3K\/mTOR pathway should be targeted at patients with IgH translocations associated with cyclin D2 overexpression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbdb","doi":"10.1038\/bcj.2011.44","first_seen_on":"2012-07-26T12:46:37+00:00","issns":["2044-5385"],"issue":"1","journal":"Blood Cancer Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343306916,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22829234"],"pmid":"22829234","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","title":"Inhibition of cell cycle progression by dual phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mTOR blockade in cyclin D2 positive multiple myeloma bearing IgH translocations.","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-cell-cycle-progression-dual-phosphatidylinositol3kinase-mtor-blockade-cyclin-d2-positive"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":3352726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1480591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77661,"mean":5.5755473860417,"rank":47615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77661,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":3.6641463414634,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.83333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
