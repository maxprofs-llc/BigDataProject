Two N,O-chelate ligands coordinate to the copper(II) atom in distorted square-planar mode, and induce metal-centered \u0394\/\u039b-chirality at the copper atom in the C2-symmetric complexes. In the solid state, the R-L1 (or R-L4) ligand chirality diastereoselectively induces a \u039b-Cu configuration in \u039b-Cu-R-L1 (or \u039b-Cu-R-L4), the S-L1 ligand a \u0394-Cu configuration in \u0394-Cu-S-L1, forming enantiopure crystals upon crystallization. Conversely, the R-L2 ligand combines both \u039b\/\u0394-Cu-R-L2 as a diastereomeric pair in the crystals. In solution, electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra show full or partial diastereoselectivity towards \u039b-Cu for R ligands and towards \u0394-Cu for S ligands. The electronic CD spectra measured on all complexes obtained from R ligands (or S ligands), e.g. Cu-R-L1, Cu-R-L2, Cu-R-L3, and Cu-R-L4 (or Cu-S-L1, Cu-S-L3, and Cu-S-L4), show consistent spectral features. TDDFT calculations of the electronic CD spectra for the diastereomers \u039b-Cu-R-L1 and \u0394-Cu-R-L1 suggest that the CD spectra are largely dominated by the configuration at the metal center (\u039b vs. \u0394). The experimental CD spectrum of Cu-R-L1 agrees well with the one calculated for the \u039b-Cu-R-L1 configuration. Cyclic voltammetry of Cu-R-L1 reveals a quasi-reversible redox wave corresponding to one-electron transfer for the [Cu(II)L2](0)\/[Cu(I)L2](-1) couple in acetonitrile. DSC analyses for the complexes show an exothermic peak between 377 and 478 K (\u0394H = -12 to -43 kJ mol(-1)), corresponding to a phase transformation from distorted square-planar\/tetrahedral to regular tetrahedral geometry on heating.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Mohammed Enamullah","AKM Royhan Uddin","Gennaro Pescitelli","Roberto Berardozzi","Gamall Makhloufi","Vera Vasylyeva","Anne-Christine Chamayou","Christoph Janiak","A.
