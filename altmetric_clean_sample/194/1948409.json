Participants (N = 278, 53% male; mean age 17 years) were recruited from a vocational college situated in an area in the most deprived national quintile (England). Participants completed measures of behavioural, normative and control beliefs, plus intention to test regularly for chlamydia. The behavioural, normative and control beliefs most strongly correlated with intentions to test regularly for chlamydia were beliefs about stopping the spread of infection, partners' behaviour and the availability of testing. These beliefs represent potential targets for interventions to increase chlamydia testing among young people living in deprived areas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Amy R Booth","Paul Norman","Peter R Harris","Elizabeth Goyder","Booth AR","Norman P","Harris PR","Goyder E"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105313510335","endpage":"1239","first_seen_on":"2013-12-02T14:46:59+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1440520534,"links":["http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/24\/1359105313510335.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/20\/9\/1229.long","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/1359105313510335"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hpq.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/24\/1359105313510335.full.pdf","pmid":"24287801","pubdate":"2013-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1229","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Using the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify key beliefs underlying chlamydia testing intentions in a sample of young people living in deprived areas.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/1359105313510335","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/using-theory-planned-behavior-identify-key-beliefs-underlying-chlamydia-testing-intentions-sample-yo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7407288,"mean":6.4395325519274,"rank":2937693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4429155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7407288,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172455,"mean":6.6982367587881,"rank":52445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":118755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172455,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1215,"mean":5.6761136738056,"rank":440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1215,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.60756,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Psychology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Newhealthpsych\/statuses\/636215082674991104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[1948409],"posted_on":"2015-08-25T16:34:30+00:00","author":{"name":"David F Marks","url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/-\/e\/B0048WASRQ","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/852965565379612672\/FGDeR5zk_normal.jpg","description":"Skeptical commentary on clinical trials, health psychology and current events.
