An electronic literature search identified 6241 citations. From these, nine original studies (10 references) relating to 858 patients were selected for inclusion in the review. Four studies compared home telemonitoring with usual care, and six randomized controlled trials compared telephone support with usual care. Clinical heterogeneity was present in many of the outcomes measured. Home telehealth (home telemonitoring and telephone support) was found to reduce rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits, while findings for hospital bed days of care varied between studies. However, the mortality rate was greater in the telephone-support group compared with usual care (risk ratio = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.75). Home telehealth interventions were similar or better than usual care for quality of life and patient satisfaction outcomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f50","authors":["J.
