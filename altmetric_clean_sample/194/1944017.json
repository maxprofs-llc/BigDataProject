In such a bacterial biofilm, cells adhere to each other and are embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM). Bacillus substilis bacteria utilize localized cell-death patterns which focuses mechanical forces to form wrinkled sheet-like structures in three dimensions. A most intriguing feature underlying this biofilm formation is that vertical buckling and ridge location is biased to occur in region of high cell-death. Here we present a spatially extended model to investigate the role of the bacterial secreted ECM during the biofilm formation and the self-organization of cell-death. Using this reaction-diffusion model we show that the interaction between the cell's motion and the ECM concentration gives rise to a self-trapping instability, leading to variety of cell-death patterns. The resultant spot patterns generated by our model are shown to be in semi-quantitative agreement with recent experimental observation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008512","authors":["Pushpita Ghosh","Eshel Ben-Jacob","Herbert Levine"],"doi":"10.1088\/1478-3975\/10\/6\/066006","first_seen_on":"2013-11-29T18:31:49+00:00","issns":["1478-3975"],"issue":"6","journal":"Physical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1385749893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/24275528\/"],"pmid":"24275528","pubdate":"2013-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Modeling cell-death patterning during biofilm formation.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modeling-celldeath-patterning-during-biofilm-formation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3562697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137587,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121043,"mean":7.1544680358886,"rank":93825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121043,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":5.6639078947368,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.9357142857143,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
