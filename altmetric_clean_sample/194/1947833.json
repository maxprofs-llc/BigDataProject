Development of bioinformatics tools that are capable of accurately detecting perfect IRs can enable genome-wide studies of IR patterns in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Different from conventional string-comparison approaches, we propose a novel algorithm that uses a cumulative score system based on a prime number representation of nucleotide bases. We then implemented this algorithm as a MATLAB-based program for perfect IR detection. In comparison with other existing tools, our program demonstrates a high accuracy in detecting nested and overlapping IRs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Chun Liang"],"doi":"10.1093\/bioinformatics\/btt651","first_seen_on":"2013-12-02T09:42:58+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1460-2059"],"journal":"Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1395780100,"links":["http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/30\/bioinformatics.btt651.short?rss=1","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/30\/bioinformatics.btt651.short","http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/30\/6\/887.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/30\/bioinformatics.btt651.full.pdf","pmid":"24215021","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"A MATLAB-based tool for accurate detection of perfect overlapping and nested inverted repeats in DNA sequences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matlabbased-tool-accurate-detection-perfect-overlapping-nested-inverted-repeats-dna-sequences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1987805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121647,"mean":7.2400525459122,"rank":47311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":71098,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121647,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4311,"mean":5.2695851508121,"rank":2891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4311,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.7583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
