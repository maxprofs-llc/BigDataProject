We here present a case of a 50-year-old female patient with metastatic bronchial carcinoid. She underwent 68Ga-DOTANOC PET\/CT and 18F-FDG PET\/CT which suggested a diagnosis of poorly differentiated NET. Biopsy of the lesion, however, revealed a second malignancy in the form of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, very rarely, other primary tumors can mimic NETs on dual-tracer PET\/CT, and biopsy is advised in doubtful cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Sachin Jain","Punit Sharma","Varun Singh Dhull","Chandrasekhar Bal","Rakesh Kumar"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e31828e98c5","first_seen_on":"2013-11-28T14:14:52+00:00","issns":["1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1385648065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24217543"],"pmid":"24217543","pubdate":"2013-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Lymphoma as a Second Malignancy in a Patient With Neuroendocrine Tumor: Mimicking Dedifferentiation on Dual-Tracer PET\/CT With 68Ga-DOTANOC and 18F-FDG.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lymphoma-second-malignancy-patient-neuroendocrine-tumor-mimicking-dedifferentiation-dualtracer-petct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943754,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121094,"mean":7.1263169629957,"rank":79144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121094,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1805,"mean":0.82966851441242,"rank":804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1805,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":0.55588235294118,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Sports and Recreations":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_carcinoid_news\/status\/406063535202902017","license":"public","citation_ids":[1941332],"posted_on":"2013-11-28T14:14:25+00:00","author":{"name":"_carcinoid_news","image":"http:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"_carcinoid_news","tweeter_id":"2209654909","followers":6},"tweet_id":"406063535202902017"}]}}
