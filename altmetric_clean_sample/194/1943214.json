Herein we describe a novel Cu(I) -catalyzed highly chemo- and enantioselective synthesis of chiral tetrahydroisoquinoline-alkaloid derivatives from readily available unsubstituted tetrahydroisoquinolines, aldehydes, and terminal alkynes in the presence of the ligand (R,R)-N-pinap. This synthetic operation installs two substituents in the 1- and 2-positions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Lin, Weilong","Cao, Tao","Fan, Wu","Han, Yulin","Kuang, Jinqiang","Luo, Hongwen","Miao, Bukeyan","Tang, Xinjun","Yu, Qiong","Yuan, Weiming","Zhang, Jiasheng","Zhu, Can","Ma, Shengming"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201308699","endpage":"281","first_seen_on":"2013-11-29T11:02:16+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"1","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
