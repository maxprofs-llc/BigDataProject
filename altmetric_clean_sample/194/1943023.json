Establishing causality from observed associations requires evidence from a variety of different scientific perspectives. The authors of these studies do not consider the complex relationship among depression, immune system function, and infectious disease, nor do they consider the antimicrobial or immune-modulating effects of antidepressant drugs. The methodology of these three CDI studies\u2014and their various sources of bias\u2014make it impossible to assess the causal validity of the association between CDI and depression or antidepressant drug exposure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a97","authors":["Robert H Howland"],"doi":"10.3928\/02793695-20130903-02","first_seen_on":"2013-11-29T09:21:35+00:00","issns":["0279-3695"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of psychosocial nursing and mental health services","last_mentioned_on":1385716867,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24278963?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24278963","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","psychology"],"title":"More on antidepressant drugs and infectious disease.","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/more-antidepressant-drugs-infectious-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":4201156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130321,"mean":7.2929266574588,"rank":105524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130321,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223,"mean":2.1975405405405,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CDifficile1\/status\/406352111622832128","license":"public","citation_ids":[1943023],"posted_on":"2013-11-29T09:21:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.cdifficile.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1633637124\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"CDifficile1","tweeter_id":"324789063","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":163},"tweet_id":"406352111622832128"}]}}
