Exploiting the time and geographical exogenous variation in compulsory schooling laws across 6 European countries this paper shows evidence of large and positive effects of the additional year of schooling induced by these policies only on men's self reported health, depression and memory in old age. Furthermore, results suggest that these effects come mainly through an improvement in men's working conditions with small or no role played by income and health related behaviors. On the other hand, since women affected by compulsory school reforms show a very low labor force attachment, they do not show similar spillovers. These policies only have mixed effects on women's health related behaviors. In particular, affected women show a lower probability of being overweight, but also a higher probability of having ever smoked.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008969","authors":["Fabrizio Mazzonna"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2013.10.042","first_seen_on":"2013-11-28T14:53:02+00:00","funders":["phs"],"issns":["02779536"],"journal":"Social Science & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1387350345,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0277953613006047"],"pmid":"24560233","pubdate":"2013-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"title":"The long lasting effects of education on old age health: evidence of gender differences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/long-lasting-effects-education-old-age-health-evidence-gender-differences-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7729567,"mean":6.6279453423321,"rank":5845168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1042819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7729567,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173086,"mean":6.6400713753361,"rank":110100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":33337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173086,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5409,"mean":9.3199485946746,"rank":5029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5409,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":7.2007272727273,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
