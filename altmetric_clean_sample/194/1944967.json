The aims of the current study were to test whether the relationship between housing type and depressive symptoms was mediated by a sense of belonging and whether housing type and sense of belonging interact to influence the depressive symptoms among older adults (moderation model).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f610001785","authors":["Suzanne McLaren","Jayne Turner","Rapson Gomez","Angus J.
