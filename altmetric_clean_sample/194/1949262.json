In cases where humeral size is limited, however, dual small-fragment locking plate constructs may serve as an alternative. The mechanical effects of different possible plate configurations around the humeral diaphysis may be important, but to our knowledge, have yet to be investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","authors":["Victor Kosmopoulos","Arvind D.
