The authors prospectively evaluated the relationship between health status at enrollment and subsequent incidence of TMD in 2,722 men and women. Participants aged 18 to 44 years had no history of TMD and were clinically free of TMD when enrolled in 2006 to 2008 at 4 U.S. study sites in the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) prospective cohort study. First-onset examiner-classified TMD developed in 260 people over a median 2.8 years of follow-up. Cox regression estimated the association between health conditions and TMD incidence while accounting for potential confounders. Incidence of first-onset TMD was 50% higher for people with low back pain (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.50, 95% confidence limits [CLs]: 1.08, 2.10) and 75% higher for people with genital pain symptoms (AHR = 1.75, 95% CLs = 1.04, 2.93) than people without a history of these pain disorders. Digit ratio, a marker of intrauterine exposure to sex hormones, was significantly associated with TMD incidence. Other independent predictors of first-onset TMD were sleep disturbance and cigarette smoking. These findings reveal multiple influences of health status on incidence of first-onset TMD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a84","authors":["Sanders, Anne E.","Slade, Gary D.","Bair, Eric","Fillingim, Roger B.","Knott, Charles","Dubner, Ronald","Greenspan, Joel D.","Maixner, William","Ohrbach, Richard","Sanders AE","Slade GD","Bair E","Fillingim RB","Knott C","Dubner R","Greenspan JD","Maixner W","Ohrbach R","Anne E.
