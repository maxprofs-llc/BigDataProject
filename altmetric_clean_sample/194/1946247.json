Here we report a novel approach to substantially enhance electrocatalytic oxygen reduction on NG electrode by the implantation of nitrogen active sites with mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4). Electrochemical characterization revealed that in neutral electrolyte the resulting NG (I-NG) exhibited super electrocatalytic activity (completely 100% of four-electron ORR pathway) and durability (nearly no activity change after 100,000 potential cyclings). When I-NG was used as cathode catalyst in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), power density and its drop percentage were also much better than the NG and Pt\/C ones, demonstrating that the current I-NG was a perfect alternative to Pt\/C and offered a new potential for constructing high-performance and less expensive cathode which is crucial for large-scale application of MFC technology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Leiyu Feng","Lanqin Yang","Zujing Huang","Jingyang Luo","Mu Li","Dongbo Wang","Yinguang Chen"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep03306","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-12-01T13:58:31+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1385906276,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/131122\/srep03306\/full\/srep03306.html"],"pmid":"24264379","pubdate":"2013-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Electrocatalysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Fuel cells","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Enhancing Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction on Nitrogen-Doped Graphene by Active Sites Implantation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancing-electrocatalytic-oxygen-reduction-nitrogendoped-graphene-active-sites-implantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3065046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120960,"mean":7.2339006936237,"rank":79137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":26965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120960,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10918,"mean":11.16184299716,"rank":7466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10918,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":704,"mean":8.5965149359886,"rank":463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":704,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
