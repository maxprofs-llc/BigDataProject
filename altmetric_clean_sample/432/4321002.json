The cell viability, the cellular malondialdehyde content (MDA) as a marker of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as markers of injury were detected. The production and gene expression of OPN were also examined. CaOx crystals attachment to cells was accomplished by measuring the calcium concentration of the cell lysates with atomic absorption analysis.\nExposure to calcium produced signs of cell injury and ROS-induced lipid peroxidation. The mRNA expression and production of OPN increased significantly. OPN knockdown can significantly decrease the amount of CaOx crystals attachment to NRK cells.\nIn response to exposure to high concentration of calcium, renal tubular epithelial NRK cells increase the production of OPN, which may have a promoting role in CaOx crystals adhesion to NRK cells by calcium stimulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Xi, Qilin","Ouyang, Jun","Pu, Jinxian","Hou, Jianquan","Wang, Shaogang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2015.07.018","first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T00:21:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0090-4295","1527-9995"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1437784566,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(15)00699-8\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429515006998\/pdf","pmid":"26216642","pubdate":"2015-07-29T22:00:48+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"High concentration of calcium stimulates calcium oxalate crystals attachment to rat tubular epithelial NRK cells through osteopontin","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/high-concentration-calcium-stimulates-calcium-oxalate-crystal-attachment-rat-tubular-epithelial-nrk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5398474,"mean":6.2979748977163,"rank":3798616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":907200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5398474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189142,"mean":8.7319611401019,"rank":131247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":37187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189142,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2138,"mean":3.1769255966308,"rank":1601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2138,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":166,"mean":2.0669696969697,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":166,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
