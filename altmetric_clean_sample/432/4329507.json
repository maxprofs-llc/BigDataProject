Compared to men, women with peripheral arterial disease have a higher rate of mobility loss with peripheral arterial disease due to poorer lower extremity functioning. This study evaluates the effect of supervised pain-free treadmill exercise on improving performance in women with intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease in comparison to men. A total of 26 participants (women, n\u2009=\u20099, 34.62%; mean age\u2009=\u200967.58\u2009\u00b1\u20095.59 years; averaging 23.46\u2009\u00b1\u20093.91 visits and 10.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.99 weeks in the program) diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease, with symptoms of intermittent claudication, partook in a 45\u2009min treadmill walk, twice per week, below the participant's minimal pain threshold. Female participants' change scores showed 752%, 278% and 115% improvement in mean walking distance, duration and rate, respectively. Men improved 334%, 149% and 80%, respectively. Significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in pre and post measurements within each group support positive outcomes. No significant differences between groups were observed (Cohen's d effect size\u2009>\u20090.80). Our results suggest that women reap similar benefits from this low-intensity treadmill program in comparison to men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c54","authors":["Dipnarine, Krishna","Barak, Sharon","Martinez, Coleen A","Carmeli, Eliezer","Stopka, Christine B"],"doi":"10.1177\/1708538115592800","first_seen_on":"2015-07-26T12:05:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1708-5381"],"journal":"Vascular","last_mentioned_on":1437907344,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26209234?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26209234","pubdate":"2015-07-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Pain-free treadmill exercise for patients with intermittent claudication: Are there gender differences?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/painfree-treadmill-exercise-patients-intermittent-claudication-gender-differences-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5402352,"mean":6.3008881422194,"rank":4494451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5402352,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189215,"mean":8.731158814887,"rank":151920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189215,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":0.98259259259259,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.50909090909091,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OMTVenezuela\/status\/625254838708744193","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4329507],"posted_on":"2015-07-26T10:42:24+00:00","author":{"name":"OMT Venezuela","url":"http:\/\/www.terapiamanual.com.ve","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3357508130\/7490ea3137e7b05c0726d0d0d0940a2a_normal.jpeg","description":"Fisioterapia Manual-Manipulativa Ortop\u00e9dica Venezuela promueve la formaci\u00f3n del fisioterapeuta o terapeuta f\u00edsico","id_on_source":"OMTVenezuela","tweeter_id":"570778564","geo":{"lt":10.48801,"ln":-66.87919,"country":"VE"},"followers":419},"tweet_id":"625254838708744193"}]}}
