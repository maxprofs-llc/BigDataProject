Type 3 resembled the endogenous depressions and Type 2 the neurotic depressions. Type 3 patients responded well to both imipramine and chlorpromazine and did poorly on a placebo. Type 2 patients showed the greatest overall improvement at three weeks irrespective of treatment received, including a placebo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","authors":["Raskin, A","Crook, T H"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T10:35:46+00:00","issns":["0033-2917"],"issue":"1","journal":"Psychological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1294392000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/935298"],"pmid":"935298","pubdate":"1976-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The endogenous--neurotic distinction as a predictor of response to antidepressant drugs.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endogenousneurotic-distinction-predictor-response-antidepressant-drugs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4071434,"mean":5.0752537679981,"rank":381749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3662015,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4071434,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70502,"mean":6.9620936737589,"rank":8956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":61418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70502,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1697,"mean":6.1309280660377,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1697,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.4928571428571,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Antidepressants Still Don&#39;t Work In Mild Depression","url":"http:\/\/neuroskeptic.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/antidepressants-still-dont-work-in-mild.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[217955,4325964,102396,4325966,4325967,4325968,4325969,2412951,217955],"posted_on":"2011-01-07T09:20:00+00:00","summary":"A new paper has added to the growing ranks of studies finding that antidepressant drugs don't work in people with milder forms of depression: Efficacy of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in minor depression.It's in the British Journal of Psychiatry and","author":{"name":"Neuroskeptic","url":"http:\/\/neuroskeptic.blogspot.com\/","description":"Back In White (Matter)"}}]}}
