Ten female control Beagles were similarly inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline solution. Prior to the start of the study, all females and 3 males used for breeding were seronegative for B burgdorferi on the basis of results of the indirect fluorescent antibody test and immunoblot (western analysis. Similarly, results of culture of blood for B burgdorferi were negative. All 20 of the females were bred naturally. Blood samples were collected weekly for serologic testing and culture. Blood samples were obtained from live pups on day 1 of life, then weekly until pups were 6 weeks old when they were euthanatized. Tissues were obtained for culture and testing by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of 10 spirochete-inoculated (SI) females, 8 became infected with B burgdorferi as evidenced by spirochete culture results and\/or PCR-detected B burgdorferi DNA in the tissues of females or their pups. Of the 10 SI females, 8 delivered litters (3 to 7 pups) that had at least 1 neonatal or 6-week-old pup with B burgdorferi DNA-positive tissues (by PCR), and spirochetes were cultured from tissues from pups of 2 litters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002221","authors":["Gustafson, J M","Burgess, E C","Wachal, M D","Steinberg, H"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-26T04:55:28+00:00","issns":["0002-9645"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1437846713,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8323057"],"pmid":"8323057","pubdate":"1993-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Intrauterine transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi in dogs.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrauterine-transmission-borrelia-burgdorferi-dogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5398474,"mean":6.2979748977163,"rank":2679144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2556966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5398474,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189160,"mean":8.7305507535989,"rank":94018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":86828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189160,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":729,"mean":2.2364285714286,"rank":282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":729,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.1230769230769,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
