Growing evidence highlights the safety and possible efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new therapeutic tool for this condition. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of bone marrow-derived MSCs on pathogenic T cells with a view to clinical application.\nT-cell lines from both inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosal specimens of CD patients and from healthy mucosa of control subjects were grown with the antigen muramyl-dipeptide in the absence or presence of donors' MSCs. The MSC effects were evaluated in terms of T-cell viability, apoptotic rate, proliferative response, immunophenotype, and cytokine profile. The role of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) was established by adding a specific inhibitor, the 1-methyl-DL-tryptophan, and by using MSCs transfected with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting IDO. The relevance of cell-cell contact was evaluated by applying transwell membranes.\nA significant reduction in both cell viability and proliferative response to muramyl-dipeptide, with simultaneous increase in the apoptotic rate, was found in T cells from both inflamed and non-inflamed CD mucosa when co-cultured with MSCs and was reverted by inhibiting IDO activity and expression. A reduction of the activated CD4(+)CD25(+) subset and increase of the CD3(+)CD69(+) population were also observed when T-cell lines from CD mucosa were co-cultured with MSCs. In parallel, an inhibitory effect was evident on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-17A and -21, whereas that of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and interleukin-6 were increased, and production of the tolerogenic molecule soluble HLA-G was high. These latter effects were almost completely eliminated by blocking the IDO, whose activity was upregulated in MSCs co-cultured with CD T cells. The use of a semipermeable membrane partially inhibited the MSC immunosuppressive effects. Finally, hardly any effects of MSCs were observed when T cells obtained from control subjects were used.\nMSCs exert potent immunomodulant effects on antigen-specific T cells in CD through a complex paracrine and cell-cell contact-mediated action, which may be exploited for widespread therapeutic use.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b6","authors":["Ciccocioppo, Rachele","Cangemi, Giuseppina C","Kruzliak, Peter","Gallia, Alessandra","Betti, Elena","Badulli, Carla","Martinetti, Miryam","Cervio, Marila","Pecci, Alessandro","Bozzi, Valeria","Dionigi, Paolo","Visai, Livia","Gurrado, Antonella","Alvisi, Costanza","Picone, Cristina","Monti, Manuela","Bernardo, Maria E","Gobbi, Paolo","Corazza, Gino R"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13287-015-0122-1","first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T11:35:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-6512"],"issue":"1","journal":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1458338556,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26206376?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/beta.stemcellres.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13287-015-0122-1","http:\/\/stemcellres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13287-015-0122-1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26206376?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pmid":"26206376","pubdate":"2015-07-25T22:05:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Ex vivo immunosuppressive effects of mesenchymal stem cells on Crohn\u2019s disease mucosal T cells are largely dependent on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and cell-cell contact","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ex-vivo-immunosuppressive-effects-mesenchymal-stem-cells-crohns-disease-mucosal-t-cells-largely-depe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":1398751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6004320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":225426,"mean":8.2362135965399,"rank":51094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":174018,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":225426,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":563,"mean":5.1005693950178,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":563,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.633,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
