Herein, we integrate LCA into our investigations of a new route to produce drop-in diesel\/jet fuel by combining furfural, obtained from the catalytic dehydration of lignocellulosic pentose sugars, with alcohols that can be derived from a variety of bio- or petroleum-based feedstocks. As a key innovation, we developed recyclable transition-metal-free hydrotalcite catalysts to promote the dehydrogenative cross-coupling reaction of furfural and alcohols to give high molecular weight adducts via a transfer hydrogenation-aldol condensation pathway. Subsequent hydrodeoxygenation of adducts over Pt\/NbOPO4 yields alkanes. Implemented in a Brazilian sugarcane biorefinery such a process could result in a 53-79\u2009% reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions relative to conventional petroleum fuels and provide a sustainable source of low carbon diesel\/jet fuel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e64","authors":["Sreekumar, Sanil","Balakrishnan, Madhesan","Goulas, Konstantinos","Gunbas, Gorkem","Gokhale, Amit A.","Louie, Lin","Grippo, Adam","Scown, Corinne D.","Bell, Alexis T.","Toste, F.
