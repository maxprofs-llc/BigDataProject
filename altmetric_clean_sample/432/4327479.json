This report describes a patient who developed profound sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo after an acute left labyrinthitis. Ten months later, she developed vertigo with apogeotropic positional nystagmus involving the left horizontal semicircular canal. Particle repositioning maneuvers and vestibular physical therapy were unsuccessful. In addition, she developed intermittent positional vertigo affecting the ipsilateral vertical semicircular canals. Given the persistence of her vertigo, multiple canal involvement, and patient preference for definitive treatment, a transmastoid labyrinthectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, the ampulla of the horizontal canal as well as that of the other canals was grossly abnormal as later confirmed on histology. After surgery, her apogeotropic nystagmus and vertigo resolved, and her balance ability gradually improved to a highly functional level.\nThis case illustrates a unique form of positional vertigo that developed and persisted after acute labyrinthitis. Conservative measures were unsuccessful and a transmastoid labyrinthectomy documented dense inflammatory tissue involving all three ampullae. We postulate that the post-labyrinthitic inflammatory changes resulted in mass loading of the membranous ampullae, causing abnormal nystagmus patterns and positional vertigo, which resolved after the labyrinthectomy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000841d","authors":["Ahmed, Sameer","Heidenreich, Katherine D","McHugh, Jonathan B","Altschuler, Richard A","Carender, Wendy J","Telian, Steven A"],"doi":"10.1097\/mao.0000000000000820","first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T13:47:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1537-4505","1531-7129"],"issue":"8","journal":"Otology & Neurotology","last_mentioned_on":1441840356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26208126?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Refractory_Positional_Vertigo_with_Apogeotropic.97515.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/otology-neurotology\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Refractory_Positional_Vertigo_With_Apogeotropic.22.aspx"],"pmid":"26208126","pubdate":"2015-07-25T22:00:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","neurology"],"title":"Refractory Positional Vertigo With Apogeotropic Horizontal Nystagmus After Labyrinthitis: Surgical Treatment and Identification of Dysmorphic Ampullae","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/refractory-positional-vertigo-apogeotropic-horizontal-nystagmus-after-labyrinthitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6315239,"mean":5.8222232064737,"rank":2240170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4034008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6315239,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193574,"mean":8.7117147019471,"rank":72117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":119154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193574,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2079,"mean":1.424781520693,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2079,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.975,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
