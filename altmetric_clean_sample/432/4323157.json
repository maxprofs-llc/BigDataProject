Research is needed to better understand the experiences of these children; however, such research is hindered by the dearth of empirical evidence to guide researchers in how best to recruit and collect data about and from IPV-exposed children whose families are mandated to services. From a qualitative study with 21 CPS- and\/or court-involved mothers, this article reports findings about participants' perspectives regarding research with their IPV-exposed children. Our analyses determined three key findings: (a) mothers' reasons or motivations for allowing their children to participate in research, (b) mothers' reasons for refusing consent for their children to participate, and (c) strategies for increasing research participation among this population. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for enhancing research participation among IPV-exposed children from CPS- and\/or court-involved families mandated to services, including specific recruitment and data collection strategies. These recommendations and strategies also hold value for research with other vulnerable families and children struggling with violence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Cynthia F.
