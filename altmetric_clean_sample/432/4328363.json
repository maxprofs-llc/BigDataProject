The Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR) are strongly involved in the fatty acid cell signalling, as many of the natural lypophylic compounds are PPAR ligands. We have previously shown that PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 is the main isotype present in cortical neuron primary cultures and that during neuronal maturation, PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 is gradually increased and activated. To get more insight into the molecular mechanism by which PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 may be involved in neuronal maturation processes, in this work a specific PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 agonist, GW0742 was used administered alone or in association with a specific PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 antagonist, the GSK0660 and the parameters involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation were assayed. The data obtained demonstrated the strong involvement of PPAR\u03b2\/\u03b4 in neuronal maturation, triggering the agonist an anticipation of neuronal differentiation and the antagonist abolishing the observed effects. These effects appear to be mediated by the activation of both BDNF canonical (BDNF7TrkB) pathway. This article is protected by copyright.
