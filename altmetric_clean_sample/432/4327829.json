In addition, the intervention group (n=43) performed very early mobilisation consisting of early and frequent out of bed activities which started within 24 hours of stroke onset for 5 to 30 minutes at least twice a day, for seven days.\nFunctional status was measured with Barthel ADL Index on admission, discharge and three months follow up.\nIntervention group showed a significant improvement in Barthel Index change scores (discharge - admission) (median=35, IQR=30-38.75 versus median=17.50, IQR=10-30) than the standard care group. Intervention group showed a significant improvement in Barthel Index change scores (three month follow up - admission) (median=42.50, IQR=35-55) versus (median=30, IQR=20-35) than the standard care group. The Intervention group reported statistically significant improvement in functional status at discharge (P<0.001) and at three months follow up (P<0.001) compared with the Standard care group.\nThe results indicate that very early mobilisation in addition to the standard care may be effective in improving the functional status following acute stroke.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002578","authors":["Chippala, Purusotham","Sharma, Raghava","Purusotham Chippala","Raghava Sharma"],"doi":"10.1177\/0269215515596054","first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T17:20:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1477-0873"],"issue":"7","journal":"Clinical Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1467955662,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198890","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26198890?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0269215515596054"],"pmid":"26198890","pubdate":"2015-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Effect of very early mobilisation on functional status in patients with acute stroke: A single-blind, randomized controlled trail.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-very-early-mobilisation-functional-status-patients-acute-stroke-singleblind-randomized-contro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029085,"mean":6.8046097213542,"rank":3153303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4850099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029085,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229138,"mean":8.4062103370474,"rank":74492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":153180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229138,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":838,"mean":6.2183345280765,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":838,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":9.1309523809524,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
