The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a dietary supplement of soy protein, isoflavones, and cotyledon fiber (Abalon) affects cardiovascular risk markers, blood glucose, and insulin levels in type 2 diabetic subjects.\nTwenty type 2 diabetic subjects participated in a crossover trial. They were randomized to double-blind supplementation for 6 weeks with Abalon (soy protein [50 g\/day] with high levels of isoflavones [minimum 165 mg\/day] and cotyledon fiber [20 g\/day]) or placebo (casein [50 g\/day] and cellulose [20 g\/day]), separated by a 3-week wash-out period.\nThe results are expressed as means +\/- SD. The percentage mean treatment difference between Abalon and placebo demonstrated significantly lower mean values after Abalon for LDL cholesterol (10 +\/- 15%, P < 0.05), LDL\/UHDL ratio (12 +\/- 18%, P < 0.05), apolipoprotein (apo) B100 (30 +\/- 38%, P < 0.01), triglycerides (22 +\/- 10%, P < 0.05), and homocysteine (14 +\/- 21%, P < 0.01), whereas the total cholesterol value tended to be less significant but still lower (8 +\/- 15%, P < 0.08). No change occurred in HDL cholesterol, apo B100\/apo A1 ratio, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, factor VIIc, von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, lipoprotein(a), glucose, HbA1c, or 24-h blood pressure.\nThese results indicate beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with Abalon on cardiovascular risk markers in type 2 diabetic subjects. This improvement is seen even in individuals with near-normal lipid values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Kjeld Hermansen","Mette S\u00f8ndergaard","Lars H\u00f8ie","Marius Carstensen","Birgitte Brock"],"doi":"10.2337\/diacare.24.2.228","first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T05:37:44+00:00","issns":["0149-5992","1935-5548"],"issue":"2","journal":"Diabetes Care","last_mentioned_on":1311811200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2337\/diacare.24.2.228"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/care.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/24\/2\/228.full.pdf","pmid":"11213870","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Beneficial Effects of a Soy-Based Dietary Supplement on Lipid Levels and Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Type 2 Diabetic Subjects","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beneficial-effects-soybased-dietary-supplement-lipid-levels-cardiovascular-risk-markers-type-2-diabe-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4069133,"mean":5.074064369123,"rank":940875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2564571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4069133,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70413,"mean":6.9570214597151,"rank":19180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":50030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70413,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3793,"mean":7.4691904008439,"rank":1500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3793,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":9.6326551724138,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
