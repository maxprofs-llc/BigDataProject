The ability of this yeast species to adapt to various environmental conditions (including extremophilic), to grow on various substrates, and to synthesize useful products makes this strain very promising for biotechnological applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce55","authors":["Sekova, V Yu","Isakova, E P","Deryabina, Yu I"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-25T15:59:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0555-1099"],"issue":"3","journal":"Prikladnaia biokhimiia i mikrobiologiia","last_mentioned_on":1437839897,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26204773?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26204773","pubdate":"2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"[Biotechnological Applications of the Extremophilic Yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (Review)].","type":"article","volume":"51","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biotechnological-applications-extremophilic-yeast-yarrowia-lipolytica-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5398474,"mean":6.2979748977163,"rank":4491376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5398474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189143,"mean":8.7319252836494,"rank":151953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189143,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.07166,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
