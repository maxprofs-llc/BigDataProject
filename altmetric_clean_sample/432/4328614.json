In this study, we synthesized four (18)F sulfonamide derivatives and evaluated their potential for imaging CA-IX expression with positron emission tomography (PET).\nAzide derivatives of two carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (AEBS) and 4-aminobenzensulfonamide (ABS) were coupled to radiosynthons with either one or three alkynes and a pendent ammoniomethyltrifluoroborate (AmBF3) to generate monovalent or trivalent enzyme inhibitors. Binding affinity to CA-IX and other CA isoforms were determined via a stopped-flow, CA catalyzed CO2 hydration assay. Tracers were radiolabeled via (18)F-(19)F isotope exchange reactions. Imaging\/biodistribution studies were performed using HT-29 tumor-bearing immunocompromised mice.\nMonomeric AmBF3-AEBS and AmBF3-ABS were obtained in 41 and 40% yields, while trimeric AmBF3-(AEBS)3 and AmBF3-(ABS)3 were obtained in 47 and 55 % yields, respectively. Derivatives bound CA-I, -II, -IX and -XII with good affinity (0.49 - 100.3 nM). (18)F-labeled sulfonamides were obtained in 16.3 - 36.8% nondecay-corrected radiochemical yields with 40 - 207 GBq\/\u00b5mol specific activity and > 95% radiochemical purity. Biodistribution\/imaging studies showed the tracers were excreted through both renal and hepatobiliary pathways. At 1 h post-injection, HT-29 tumor xenografts were clearly visualized in PET images with modest contrast for all four tracers. Tumor uptake was two-folds higher for monovalent tracers (~ 0.60 %ID\/g) compared to trivalent tracers (~ 0.30 %ID\/g); however, tumor-to-background ratios were significantly better for (18)F-AmBF3-(ABS)3. Pre-blocking with acetazolamide reduced > 80% uptake of (18)F-AmBF3-(ABS)3 in HT-29 tumors.\nOur data suggests that trimerization of an otherwise nonspecific CA inhibitor greatly enhances the selectivity for CA-IX in vivo and represents a promising strategy for creating multivalent enzyme inhibitors for selectively imaging extracellular enzyme activity by PET.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da6","authors":["Lau, Joseph","Liu, Zhibo","Lin, Kuo-Shyan","Pan, Jinhe","Zhang, Zhengxing","Vullo, Daniela","Supuran, Claudiu T","Perrin, David M","Benard, Francois"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.114.153288","first_seen_on":"2015-07-26T01:06:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1535-5667"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438018686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26205302?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26205302?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26205302","pubdate":"2015-07-26T22:02:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Trimeric radiofluorinated sulfonamide derivatives to achieve in vivo selectivity for carbonic anhydrase IX-targeted PET imaging.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trimeric-radiofluorinated-sulfonamide-derivatives-achieve-vivo-selectivity-carbonic-anhydrase-ixtarg"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5407305,"mean":6.305638961301,"rank":2495560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2776036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5407305,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189264,"mean":8.7321715919119,"rank":85709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":97054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189264,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1810,"mean":2.8459933665008,"rank":552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1810,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":2.9053333333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
