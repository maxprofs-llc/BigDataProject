Retinopathy changes over time were determined by DRSS step differences from baseline to month 36. Pairwise comparisons between the 3 treatment groups were performed using a log-rank test without adjustment for covariates, with the primary comparison between sham control and 0.2 \u03bcg\/day FAc.\nStudy eye progression to PDR based on a composite clinical outcome of (1)\u00a0progression from nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) to PDR based on graded fundus photographs, (2)\u00a0panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), or (3) pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for PDR; and study eye changes on the DRSS.\nIn the integrated FAME data set, compared with sham control-treated subjects, time to first PDR event was significantly delayed in subjects treated with FAc (P < 0.001), and this effect was confirmed in subgroups with more severe DR and chronic DME at baseline. In addition, subjects with retinal nonperfusion at baseline showed greater reduction in progression to PDR with FAc treatment. Both FAc dosages demonstrated statistically significant improvements in mean DR severity compared with sham treatment at months 6, 12, and 18. Numerically more subjects who received FAc experienced 2-or-more- or 3-or-more-step improvements in DR severity compared with subjects who received sham; conversely, fewer subjects treated with FAc experienced 2-or-more- or 3-or-more-step worsening in DR severity. The 3-or-more-step improvement with 0.5 \u03bcg\/day FAc was statistically significantly different from sham control.\nIn subjects with DME, sustained intraocular delivery of FAc slows development of PDR and slows progression of diabetic retinopathy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Charles C.
