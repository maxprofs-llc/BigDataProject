Primary care attenders were more likely than accident and emergency patients to be young adults, to have symptoms with a duration of longer than 24 hours, and to present problems not related to injury (all P < 0.001). Accident and emergency patients were considerably more likely to be referred to on call teams and to be admitted. Even so, 9.7% of primary care patients were referred to on call teams and a further 8.9% were referred to the fracture clinic or advised to return to the accident and emergency department for follow up.\nAccident and emergency triage can be developed to identify patients with problems that are more likely to be of a primary care type, and these patients are less likely to receive an investigation, minor surgical procedure, or referral. Many patients in this category, however, receive interventions likely to support their decision to attend accident and emergency rather than general practice. This may reflect limitations in the sensitivity of triage practice or a clinical approach of junior medical staff that includes a propensity to intervene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["Jeremy Dale","Judith Green","Fiona Reid","Edward Glucksman"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.311.7002.423","endpage":"426","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T17:11:22+00:00","issns":["0959-8138","1468-5833"],"issue":"7002","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.311.7002.423"],"pmcid":"PMC2550493","pmid":"7640591","pubdate":"1995-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"423","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Primary care in the accident and emergency department: I.
