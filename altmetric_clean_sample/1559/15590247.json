Drastic softening in C_{11}, C_{33}, C_{12}, and C_{13} elastic moduli associated with the compressive stress component and stiffening in C_{44} and C_{14} moduli associated with the shear stress component are observed to occur within the spin transition between \u223c42.4 and \u223c46.5\u2009\u2009GPa. Negative values of C_{12} and C_{13} are also observed within the spin transition region. The Born criteria constants for the crystal remain positive within the spin transition, indicating that the mixed-spin state remains mechanically stable. Significant auxeticity can be related to the electronic spin transition-induced elastic anomalies based on the analysis of Poisson's ratio. These elastic anomalies are explained using a thermoelastic model for the rhombohedral system. Finally, we conclude that mixed-spin state ferromagnesite, which is potentially a major deep-carbon carrier, is expected to exhibit abnormal elasticity, including a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.6 and drastically reduced V_{P} by 10%, in Earth's midlower mantle.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Suyu Fu","Jing Yang","Jung-Fu Lin"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.118.036402","first_seen_on":"2017-01-19T16:12:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"3","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1484915016,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.036402?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.036402"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.118.036402","pmid":"28157335","pubdate":"2017-01-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Abnormal Elasticity of Single-Crystal Magnesiosiderite across the Spin Transition in Earth\u2019s Lower Mantle","type":"article","volume":"118","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/abnormal-elasticity-singlecrystal-magnesiosiderite-across-spin-transition-earths-lower-mantle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":3332884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4712440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259517,"mean":12.826361126096,"rank":104170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":153073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259517,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16163,"mean":11.121285855711,"rank":8682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":7426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16163,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":385,"mean":22.384817708333,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":385,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
