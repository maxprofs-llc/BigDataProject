An enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation\/pyranoside ring-contraction reaction leads from UDP-\u03b1-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) to the Api precursor UDP-\u03b1-d-apiose (UDP-Api). We examined the mechanism of UDP-Api\/UDP-\u03b1-d-xylose synthase (UAXS) with site-selectively (2) H-labeled and deoxygenated substrates. The analogue UDP-2-deoxy-GlcA, which prevents C-2\/C-3 aldol cleavage as the plausible initiating step of pyranoside-to-furanoside conversion, did not give the corresponding Api product. Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) support an UAXS mechanism in which substrate oxidation by enzyme-NAD(+) and retro-aldol sugar ring-opening occur coupled in a single rate-limiting step leading to decarboxylation. Rearrangement and ring-contracting aldol addition in an open-chain intermediate then give the UDP-Api aldehyde, which is intercepted via reduction by enzyme-NADH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Eixelsberger, Thomas","Horvat, Doroteja","Gutmann, Alexander","Weber, Hansj\u00f6rg","Nidetzky, Bernd"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201609288","first_seen_on":"2017-01-20T02:02:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-7851","1521-3773","14337851"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
