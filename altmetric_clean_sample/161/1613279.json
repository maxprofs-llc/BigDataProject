Simian virus 40 (SV40), a DNA virus, was introduced inadvertently to human populations through contaminated polio vaccine during the years 1956-1963. It has been associated with various types of malignancy in animal experiments. There have been suggestions that SV40 might play a role in the pathogenesis of DMM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064dc","authors":["Mohammad-Taheri Z","Nadji SA","Raisi F","Mohammadi F","Bahadori M","Mark EJ","Mohammad\u2010Taheri, Zohreh","Nadji, Seyed Alireza","Raisi, Farshid","Mohammadi, Forouzan","Bahadori, Moslem","Mark, Eugene Jerome"],"doi":"10.1002\/ajim.22160","endpage":"1225","first_seen_on":"2013-07-09T18:54:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0271-3586","1097-0274"],"issue":"10","journal":"American Journal of Industrial Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1379256183,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23828611","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ajim.22160\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ajim.22160\/pdf","pmid":"23828611","pubdate":"2013-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1221","subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"title":"No association between simian virus 40 and diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura in Iranian patients: A molecular and epidemiologic case\u2013control study of 60 patients","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-simian-virus-40-diffuse-malignant-mesothelioma-pleura-iranian-patients-molecular"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7088931,"mean":6.2940412843656,"rank":3108606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3820359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7088931,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120862,"mean":6.7310982037217,"rank":45744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":71409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120862,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1043,"mean":5.4261535508637,"rank":796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1043,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.915,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
