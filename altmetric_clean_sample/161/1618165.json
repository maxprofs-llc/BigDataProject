Given the growing availability of complete vertebrate genomes, comparative genomics represents a promising approach to address this question. Here we used genomics and molecular approaches to study how ion channel genes influence the properties of the brain circuitry that regulates birdsong, a learned vocal behavior with important similarities to human speech acquisition. We focused on potassium (K-)Channels, which are major determinants of neuronal cell excitability.Starting with the human gene set of K-Channels, we used cross-species mRNA\/protein alignments, and syntenic analysis to define the full complement of orthologs, paralogs, allelic variants, as well as novel loci not previously predicted in the genome of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). We also compared protein coding domains in chicken and zebra finch orthologs to identify genes under positive selective pressure, and those that contained lineage-specific insertions\/deletions in functional domains. Finally, we conducted comprehensive in situ hybridizations to determine the extent of brain expression, and identify K-Channel gene enrichments in nuclei of the avian song system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-14-470","first_seen_on":"2013-07-11T10:25:45+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1375209001,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/14\/470\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-14-470.pdf","pmid":"23845108","pubdate":"2013-07-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"470","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Genomics analysis of potassium channel genes in songbirds reveals molecular specializations of brain circuits for the maintenance and production of learned vocalizations","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomics-analysis-potassium-channel-genes-songbirds-reveals-molecular-specializations-brain-circuits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":855631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3648078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89102,"mean":7.5830169582834,"rank":19872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":69077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89102,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4128,"mean":3.6174417252241,"rank":841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4128,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":5.2304161073826,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
