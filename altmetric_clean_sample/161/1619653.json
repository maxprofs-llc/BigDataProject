The results revealed that all participants had a higher mental rotation accuracy for human figures compared to cubed figures, that the gender difference was reduced with human figures, and that gymnasts demonstrated a better mental rotation performance than non-athletes. The results are discussed against the background of the existing literature on motor experts, mental rotation performance as well as the importance of the testing situation and the test construction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5183cf058f61000382c","authors":["Petra Jansen","Jennifer Lehmann"],"doi":"10.2478\/v10053-008-0135-8","first_seen_on":"2013-07-11T23:46:24+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"2","journal":"Advances in Cognitive Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1375417235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3700661\/?report=classic"],"pmcid":"PMC3700661","pmid":"23833695","pubdate":"2013-07-12T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Versita","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"92","title":"Mental rotation performance in soccer players and gymnasts in an object-based mental rotation task","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mental-rotation-performance-soccer-players-gymnasts-objectbased-mental-rotation-task"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":4606485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99022,"mean":7.5973476939236,"rank":66982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99022,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":3.7679285714286,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.3666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
