The first one tests the simplest task for which quantum mechanics provides an advantage with respect to classical physics. The quantum advantage is certified by the violation of Wright's inequality, the simplest classical inequality violated by quantum mechanics. In the second experiment, we obtain contextual correlations by sequentially measuring pairs of compatible observables on a qutrit, and show the violation of Klyachko et al.'s inequality, the most fundamental noncontextuality inequality violated by qutrits. Our experiment tests exactly Klyachko et al.'s inequality, uses the same measurement procedure for each observable in every context, and implements the sequential measurements in any possible order.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Johan Ahrens","Elias Amselem","Ad\u00c3\u00a1n Cabello","Mohamed Bourennane","Ahrens J","Amselem E","Cabello A","Bourennane M","Ad\u00e1n Cabello"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep02170","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-07-10T12:31:21+00:00","issns":["xxxx-xxxx","2045-2322",""],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1425510013,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep02170","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2013\/130710\/srep02170\/full\/srep02170.html"],"pmcid":"PMC3707040","pmid":"23838749","pubdate":"2013-07-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Quantum mechanics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Quantum information","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Other photonics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Information theory and computation","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"","subjects":["science"],"title":"Two Fundamental Experimental Tests of Nonclassicality with Qutrits","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/urn.kb.se\/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-92626","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-fundamental-experimental-tests-nonclassicality-qutrits"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4833580,"mean":5.7669729527574,"rank":3230577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1411000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4833580,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91549,"mean":7.6444627517805,"rank":58709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":29049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91549,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14331,"mean":12.974633775297,"rank":9845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14331,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":9.3459808429119,"rank":367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
