Treatment options for fractures of the condyles consist of either the closed method or by open reduction with fixation. Complications may be associated with either treatment option; for the closed approach these can include malocclusion, particularly open bites, reduced posterior facial height and facial asymmetry in addition to chronic pain and reduced mobility. A cutaneous scar and temporary paralysis of the facial nerve are not infrequent complications associated with the open approach. There is a lack of consensus currently surrounding the indications for either surgical or non-surgical treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Sharif MO","Fedorowicz Z","Drews P","Nasser M","Dorri M","Newton T","Oliver R"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd006538.pub2","first_seen_on":"2013-07-11T20:34:59+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1465-1858",""],"issue":"4","journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1433607103,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20393948","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2;jsessionid=80C5A8343C5374104941C459A38109A3.f04t02?identityKey=d99fc8e3-856b-4683-a6da-f03bd627f186&isReportingDone=true&regionCode=GB-EN","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2;jsessionid=5BE93AF5CEE7292CA8351086B32C54AB.f03t02?identityKey=bd1c6e07-c56d-4e28-ac49-cbaf50fb5bda&isReportingDone=true&regionCode=GB-EN","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2;jsessionid=33FB0956C45D8473162A2CC8DB70F051.f03t04?identityKey=9a3800f2-690c-46bb-9ad9-71932d8cd3f6&isReportingDone=true&regionCode=GB-EN"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD006538.pub2\/pdf","pmid":"20393948","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Interventions for the treatment of fractures of the mandibular condyle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interventions-treatment-fractures-mandibular-condyle-11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6374069,"mean":5.9861712915517,"rank":2137037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4215605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6374069,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100596,"mean":7.5380474775088,"rank":31391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":68759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100596,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7630,"mean":13.056098571241,"rank":5394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7630,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":15.869459459459,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/monalisa1n\/statuses\/355424783799816192","license":"public","citation_ids":[1611487,1619419],"posted_on":"2013-07-11T20:34:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Mona Nasser","url":"https:\/\/monanasser.wordpress.com\/about\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902675605686280192\/9UerNAaL_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor in Evidence Based Dentistry @pupsmd \/pilot\/skydiver\/yoga teacher\/ amateur artist & aerialist \/wannabe astronaut @capsmg @astro_mona","id_on_source":"monalisa1n","tweeter_id":"41491084","geo":{"lt":50.37153,"ln":-4.14305,"country":"GB"},"followers":2551},"tweet_id":"355424783799816192"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CochraneOHG\/status\/491553847840866304","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1619419],"posted_on":"2014-07-22T12:02:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Cochrane Oral Health","url":"http:\/\/www.oralhealth.cochrane.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763373644059934720\/nC86TQrA_normal.jpg","description":"Preparing, maintaining and disseminating systematic reviews of clinical trials in the field of oral health.
