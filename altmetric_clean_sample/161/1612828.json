Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop targeted therapies capable of eliminating the MDS-initiating clones. We identified that IRAK1, an immune-modulating kinase, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in MDSs. MDS clones treated with a small molecule IRAK1 inhibitor (IRAK1\/4-Inh) exhibited impaired expansion and increased apoptosis, which coincided with TRAF6\/NF-\u03baB inhibition. Suppression of IRAK1, either by RNAi or with IRAK1\/4-Inh, is detrimental to MDS cells, while sparing normal CD34(+) cells. Based on an integrative gene expression analysis, we combined IRAK1 and BCL2 inhibitors and found that cotreatment more effectively eliminated MDS clones. In summary, these findings implicate IRAK1 as a drugable target in MDSs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Garrett\u00a0W.
