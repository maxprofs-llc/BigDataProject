The purpose of such a facility would be to take delivery of the flight hardware that lands on Earth, open the spacecraft and extract the sample container and samples, and conduct an agreed-upon test protocol, while ensuring strict containment and contamination control of the samples while in the SRF. Any samples that are found to be non-hazardous (or are rendered non-hazardous by sterilization) would then be transferred to long-term curation. Although the general concept of an SRF is relatively straightforward, there has been considerable discussion about implementation planning. The Mars Exploration Program carried out an analysis of the attributes of an SRF to establish its scope, including minimum size and functionality, budgetary requirements (capital cost, operating costs, cost profile), and development schedule. The approach was to arrange for three independent design studies, each led by an architectural design firm, and compare the results. While there were many design elements in common identified by each study team, there were significant differences in the way human operators were to interact with the systems. In aggregate, the design studies provided insight into the attributes of a future SRF and the complex factors to consider for future programmatic planning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009AsBio...9..745B","altmetric_jid":"ads","authors":["Beaty DW","Allen CC","Bass DS","Buxbaum KL","Campbell JK","Lindstrom DJ","Miller SL","Papanastassiou DA"],"doi":"10.1089\/ast.2009.0339","first_seen_on":"2013-07-10T16:10:46+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Astrophysics Data System (ADS)","last_mentioned_on":1373451180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19845446?report=abstract"],"pmid":"19845446","pubdate":"2009-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Astronomical And Space Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geochemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Geology","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Planning considerations for a Mars Sample Receiving Facility: summary and interpretation of three design studies.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/planning-considerations-mars-sample-receiving-facility-summary-interpretation-three-design-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.296,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.296},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":566434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3119166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85054,"mean":7.2824779372861,"rank":16182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":68870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85054,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":16.192888372093,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":25.4775,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
