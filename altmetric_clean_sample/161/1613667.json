The specimens of Proisocrinus ruberrimus, here termed \"Moulin rouge\" as a pseudonym due to its conspicuous red color, were collected from depths of approximately 1,800 m and are characterized by a long, slender stalk. The proximal columnals are pentalobate in cross section, with isocrinid-like articular facets; several bear rudimentary cirri. The following columnals lose the cirri and rapidly become almost circular; their facets bear radiating crenulations similar to those of Millericrinida. The characters observed in the proximal stalk indicate that the 'Moulin Rouge' (P. ruberrimus) belongs to the order Isocrinida rather than to the order Millericrinida. Naumachocrinus hawaiiensis was collected at a depth of 1,440 m. The long, cylindrical crown and number of arms indicate that Naumachocrinus should be classified in the Bathycrinidae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f610003761","authors":["Oji T","Kitazawa
