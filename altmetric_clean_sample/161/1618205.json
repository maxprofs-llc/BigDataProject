Studies in Drosophila and vertebrate systems have revealed several important chromatin barrier elements and their respective binding factors. However, epigenomic data indicate that the binding of these factors are not exclusive to chromatin boundaries. To gain a comprehensive understanding of facultative heterochromatin boundaries, we developed a two-tiered method to identify the Chromatin Transitional Region (CTR), i.e. the nucleosomal region that shows the greatest transition rate of the H3K27me3 modification as revealed by ChIP-Seq. This approach was applied to identify CTRs in Drosophila S2 cells and human HeLa cells. Although many insulator proteins have been characterized in Drosophila, less than half of the CTRs in S2 cells are associated with known insulator proteins, indicating unknown mechanisms remain to be characterized. Our analysis also revealed that the peak binding of insulator proteins are usually 1-2 nucleosomes away from the CTR. Comparison of CTR-associated insulator protein binding sites vs. those in heterochromatic region revealed that boundary-associated binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significant decreased nucleosome density and increased binding intensities of co-factors. Interestingly, several subgroups of boundaries have enhanced H3.3 incorporation but reduced nucleosome turnover rate. Our genome-wide study reveals that diverse mechanisms are employed to define the boundaries of facultative heterochromatin. In both Drosophila and mammalian systems, only a small fraction of insulator protein binding sites co-localize with H3K27me3 boundaries. However, boundary-associated insulator binding sites are distinctively flanked by nucleosome destabilizing sequences, which correlates with significantly decreased nucleosome density and increased binding of co-factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0067156","first_seen_on":"2013-07-11T10:44:45+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1373972586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23840609?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23840609","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Genome-wide identification of chromatin transitional regions reveals diverse mechanisms defining the boundary of facultative heterochromatin.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-identification-chromatin-transitional-regions-reveals-diverse-mechanisms-defining-boundar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89090,"mean":7.4887256339168,"rank":36542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":50019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89090,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":34768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3705,"mean":12.128480561555,"rank":1703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3705,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
