Recent progress in understanding the force-generating mechanism of dynein using x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and single molecule studies has provided key insight into the structure and mechanism of action of this complex motor protein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Masahide Kikkawa"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.201304099","first_seen_on":"2013-07-09T02:12:48+00:00","issns":["1540-8140","0021-9525"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1496839500,"links":["http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/202\/1\/15.abstract","http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/202\/1\/15.full","http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/202\/1\/15#ref-17"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jcb.rupress.org\/content\/202\/1\/15.full.pdf","pmid":"23836927","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Big steps toward understanding dynein","type":"article","volume":"202","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/big-steps-toward-understanding-dynein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.35,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":641881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7687485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125998,"mean":7.0588447820188,"rank":10879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":115092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125998,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5229,"mean":5.4291801836266,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5229,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.587037037037,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
