The C-terminal domain is identical in fold to the equivalent region of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow pol I). Although the N-terminal domain of Klentaq1 differs greatly in sequence from its counterpart in Klenow pol I, it has clearly evolved from a common ancestor. The structure of Klentaq1 reveals the strategy utilized by this protein to maintain activity at high temperatures and provides the structural basis for future improvements of the enzyme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["S Korolev","M Nayal","W M Barnes","E Di Cera","G Waksman"],"first_seen_on":"2013-07-09T00:34:04+00:00","issns":["1091-6490"],"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1373330031,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/92\/20\/9264.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/92\/20\/9264.full.pdf","pmid":"7568114","pubdate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Crystal structure of the large fragment of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase I at 2.5-A resolution: structural basis for thermostability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-large-fragment-thermus-aquaticus-dna-polymerase-i-25a-resolution-structural-basis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2903792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84607,"mean":7.3027772498406,"rank":67383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33578,"mean":13.651509783483,"rank":30312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33578,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":882,"mean":30.211461975028,"rank":816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":882,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
