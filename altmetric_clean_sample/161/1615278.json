However, aggrecan itself is also susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Here, the use of a biomimetic proteoglycan (mAGC) is presented, which functionally mimics aggrecan but lacks the known cleavage sites, protecting the molecule from proteolytic degradation. The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of this molecule in ex vivo (human OA synovial fluid) and in vivo (Sprague-Dawley rats) osteoarthritic models. These results indicate that mAGC's may protect articular cartilage against the loss of key ECM components, and lower catabolic protein and gene expression in both models. This suppression of matrix degradation has the potential to provide a healthy environment for tissue repair.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Sharma, Shaili","Lee, Aeju","Choi, Kuiwon","Kim, Kwangmeyung","Youn, Inchan","Trippel, Stephen B.","Panitch, Alyssa"],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201300112","endpage":"1237","first_seen_on":"2013-07-10T14:02:01+00:00","issns":["1616-5195","1616-5187"],"issue":"9","journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1373464897,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300112\/abstract;jsessionid=49737A7CE6AD5EFCD4465196993CE8F8.d03t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fmabi.201300112&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201300112\/pdf","pmid":"23836445","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1228","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Biomimetic Aggrecan Reduces Cartilage Extracellular Matrix From Degradation and Lowers Catabolic Activity in Ex Vivo and In Vivo Models","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomimetic-aggrecan-reduces-cartilage-extracellular-matrix-degradation-lowers-catabolic-activity-ex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330725,"mean":5.9768190153299,"rank":4448962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1652729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330725,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100140,"mean":7.5468952156503,"rank":63471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":32418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100140,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":629,"mean":1.8292292993631,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":629,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.6875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
