Isaridin F (3) possesses a cyclodepsipeptide ring with N-methylbutyric acid, which is rare in natural peptides. Absolute configurations of the new cyclodepsipeptides were achieved by Marfey's method. The anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compounds was investigated through evaluating their effect on superoxide anion production and elastase release by FMLP-induced human neutrophils. Among the tested compounds, desmethylisaridin E (1) inhibited superoxide anion production and desmethylisaridin C2 (2) inhibited elastase release, with IC50 values of 10.00 \u00b1 0.80 and 10.01 \u00b1 0.46 \u03bcM, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8b","authors":["Yu-Ming Chung","Mohamed El-Shazly","Da-Wei Chuang","Tsong-Long Hwang","Teigo Asai","Yoshiteru Oshima","Mohamed L.
