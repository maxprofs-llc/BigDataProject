Previous studies of transcriptional profiling have revealed biologically relevant GBM subtypes associated with specific mutations and dysregulated pathways. Here, we applied a modified proteome to uncover abnormal protein expression profile in a MRI-classified group I GBM (GBM1), which has a spatial relationship with one of the adult neural stem cell niches, subventricular zone (SVZ). Most importantly, we identified molecular characteristics in this type of GBM that include up-regulation of metabolic enzymes, ribosomal proteins, and heat shock proteins. As GBM1 often recurs at great distances from the initial lesion, the rewiring of metabolism, and ribosomal biogenesis may facilitate cancer cells' growth and survival during tumor progression. The intimate contact between GBM1 and the SVZ raises the possibility that tumor cells in GBM1 may be most related to SVZ cells. In support of this notion, we found that markers representing SVZ cells are highly expressed in GBM1. Emerged findings from our study provide a specific protein expression profile in GBM1 and offer better prediction or therapeutic implication for this multifocal GBM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc4f","authors":["William E.
