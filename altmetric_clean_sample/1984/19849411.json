Glaucoma patients annually spend only a few hours in an eye clinic but spend more than 5000 waking hours engaged in everything else. We propose that patients could self-monitor changes in visual symptoms providing valuable between clinic information; we test the hypothesis that this is feasible using a web-based diary tool. Methods. Ten glaucoma patients with a range of visual field loss took part in an eight-week pilot study. After completing a series of baseline tests, volunteers were prompted to monitor symptoms every three days and complete a diary about their vision during daily life using a bespoke web-based diary tool. Response to an end of a study questionnaire about the usefulness of the exercise was a main outcome measure. Results. Eight of the 10 patients rated the monitoring scheme to be \"valuable\" or \"very valuable.\" Completion rate to items was excellent (96%). Themes from a qualitative synthesis of the diary entries related to behavioural aspects of glaucoma. One patient concluded that a constant focus on monitoring symptoms led to negative feelings. Conclusions. A web-based diary tool for monitoring self-reported glaucoma symptoms is practically feasible. The tool must be carefully designed to ensure participants are benefitting, and it is not increasing anxiety.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004087","authors":["McDonald, Leanne"],"doi":"10.1155\/2017\/8452840","first_seen_on":"2017-05-04T12:43:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2090-004X","2090-0058"],"journal":"Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1506065408,"links":["https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840\/?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840\/","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840\/?utm_content=buffer1d8f9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840\/?utm_content=bufferd8781&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840\/cta\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/joph\/2017\/8452840.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5435987","pmid":"28546876","pubdate":"2017-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Self-Monitoring Symptoms in Glaucoma: A Feasibility Study of a Web-Based Diary Tool","type":"article","volume":"2017","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfmonitoring-symptoms-glaucoma-feasibility-study-webbased-diary-tool"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.65,"score_history":{"1y":9.65,"6m":9.65,"3m":1.85,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.65},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":927242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7522654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249582,"mean":12.696100961211,"rank":42023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":207472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249582,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":1.8854658634538,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.1092857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":6,"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
