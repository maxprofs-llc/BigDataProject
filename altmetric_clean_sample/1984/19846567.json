This study aimed to analyse the cases reported in institutional data recording systems to estimate the burden of invasive meningococcal diseases (IMDs) and assess the effectiveness of surveillance in Veneto region (Italy).\nAnalysis was performed from 2007 to 2014 on data recorded in different systems: Mandatory Notification System, National Surveillance of Invasive Bacterial Diseases System and Laboratories Surveillance System (LSS), which were pooled into a combined surveillance system (CSS) and hospital discharge records (HDRs). A capture-recapture method was used and completeness of each source estimated. Number of cases with IMD by source of information and year, incidence of IMD by age group, case fatality rate (CFR) and distribution of meningococcal serogroups by year were also analysed.\nCombining the four data systems enabled the identification of 179 confirmed cases with IMD, achieving an overall sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 90.8% to 98.8%), while it was 76.7% (95% CI: 73.6% to 80.1%) for CSS and 77.2% (95% CI: 74.1% to 80.6%) for HDRs. Typing of isolates was done in 80% of cases, and 95.2% of the typed cases were provided by LSS. Serogroup B was confirmed in 50.3% of cases. The estimated IMD notification rate (cases with IMD diagnosed and reported to the surveillance systems) was 0.48\/100 000 population, and incidence peaked at 6.2\/100 000 in children aged <1\u2009year old (60.9% due to MenB), and increased slightly in the age group between 15 and 19 years (1.1\/100 000). A CFR of 14% was recorded (8.7% in paediatric age).\nQuality of surveillance systems relies on case ascertainment based on serological characterisation of the circulating strains by microbiology laboratories. All available sources should be routinely combined to improve the epidemiology of IMD and the information used by public health departments to conduct timely preventive measures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Tatjana Baldovin","Roberta Lazzari","Silvia Cocchio","Patrizia Furlan","Chiara Bertoncello","Mario Saia","Francesca Russo","Vincenzo Baldo"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-012478","first_seen_on":"2017-05-04T10:19:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"4","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1493892971,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28465304?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-012478"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/bmjopen\/7\/4\/e012478.full.pdf","pmid":"28465304","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e012478","title":"Invasive meningococcal disease in the Veneto region of Italy: a capture-recapture analysis for assessing the effectiveness of an integrated surveillance system","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invasive-meningococcal-disease-veneto-region-italy-capturerecapture-analysis-assessing-effectiveness"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155745,"mean":6.9068271228166,"rank":7058895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155745,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236149,"mean":12.562587047106,"rank":192014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236149,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5920,"mean":16.91429565805,"rank":5468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5920,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":444,"mean":13.057291196388,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":444,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medicineupdate\/statuses\/860075574961868800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19846567],"posted_on":"2017-05-04T10:16:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1K3w","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3388626222\/3c70af58befec0257424ebde88c5f261_normal.png","description":"The top 5 internal medicine journals","id_on_source":"medicineupdate","tweeter_id":"174988635","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3335},"tweet_id":"860075574961868800"}]}}
