One way to understand the neural basis of object representation is to estimate the number of neural dimensions that are needed for veridical representation of object categories. In this study, the characteristics of the match between physical-shape and neural representational spaces in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex have been evaluated. Specifically, we examined how the number of neural dimensions, stimulus behavioral saliency and stimulus category selectivity of neurons affect the correlation between shape and neural representational spaces in IT cortex. Single unit recordings from monkey IT revealed that there was a significant match between face space and its neural representation at lower neural dimensions while the optimal match for the non-face objects was observed at higher neural dimensions. There was a statistically significant match between the face and neural spaces only in the face selective neurons while a significant match was observed for non-face objects in all neurons regardless of their category selectivity. Interestingly, the face neurons showed higher match for the non-face objects than for the faces at higher neural dimensions. The optimal representation of face space in the responses of the face neurons was a low dimensional map that emerged early (~ 150ms post stimulus onset) and was followed by a high dimensional and relatively late (~300ms) map for the non-face stimuli. These results support a multiplexing function for the face neurons in the representation of highly similar shape spaces, but with different dimensionality and timing scales.
