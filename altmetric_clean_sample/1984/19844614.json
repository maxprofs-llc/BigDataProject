Images were exported from the device, and analysis was performed by 2 graders in the Doheny Image Reading Center using Image J software. The choroidal thickness at the foveal center was measured. In addition, the inner and outer boundaries of the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as the inner retinal surface all were segmented to allow the brightness and reflectivity of the pixels in the choroid, RPE band, and overlying vitreous to be quantified. An adjusted or normalized choroidal reflectivity, with the RPE as the bright reference standard and the vitreous as the\u00a0dark reference standard, was computed using the formula: normalized choroidal reflectivity\u00a0= (choroidal reflectivity-vitreous reflectivity)\/RPE reflectivity.\nChoroidal reflectivity and choroidal thickness.\nThree hundred eighty-six eyes in the BSCR group and 59 eyes in the control group were included in this analysis. Higher choroidal reflectivity and lower choroidal thickness were documented in inactive BSCR patients compared with active BSCR and controls (P < 0.01). Active BSCR patients showed lower choroidal thickness compared with controls (P < 0.01). There was a negative correlation between choroidal reflectivity and choroidal thickness (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.793; P < 0.001). On multiple regression analysis, choroidal thickness, age, and disease duration (all P < 0.01) all were significant predictors of choroidal reflectivity.\nChoroidal reflectivity and choroidal thickness changes are evident in active and inactive BSCR patients. Novel choroidal parameters such as choroidal reflectivity may warrant further study in the setting of BSCR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Anna I.
