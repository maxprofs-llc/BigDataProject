Herein, we developed an efficient OER electrocatalyst with nickel boride (Ni3 B) nanoparticles as cores and nickel(II) borate (Ni-Bi ) as shells (Ni-Bi @NB) via a very simple and facile aqueous reaction. This electrocatalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 302\u2005mV at 10\u2005mA\u2009cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 52\u2005mV\u2009dec(-1) . More interestingly, it was found that the OER activity of Ni-Bi @NB was closely dependent on the crystallinity of the Ni-Bi shells. The partially crystalline Ni-Bi catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the amorphous or crystalline analogues; this higher activity originated from the enhanced intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites. These findings open up opportunities to explore nickel(II) borates as a new class of efficient nonprecious metal OER electrocatalysts, and to improve the electrocatalyst performance by modulating their crystallinity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Jiang, Wen\u2010Jie","Niu, Shuai","Tang, Tang","Zhang, Qing\u2010Hua","Liu, Xiao\u2010Zhi","Zhang, Yun","Chen, Yu\u2010Yun","Li, Ji\u2010Hui","Gu, Lin","Wan, Li\u2010Jun","Hu, Jin\u2010Song"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201703183","endpage":"6577","first_seen_on":"2017-05-04T11:46:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"issue":"23","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
