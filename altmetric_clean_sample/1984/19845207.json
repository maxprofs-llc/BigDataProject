Our approach relies on conformal mapping which, for the two-bubble problem, involves the Schottky-Klein prime function associated with an annulus. We show that a countably infinite number of solutions exist for each fixed value of dimensionless surface tension, with the bubble shapes becoming more exotic as the solution branch number increases. Our numerical results suggest that a single solution is selected in the limit that surface tension vanishes, with the scaling between the bubble velocity and surface tension being different to the well-studied problems for a bubble or a finger propagating in a channel geometry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a2","authors":["Christopher C.
