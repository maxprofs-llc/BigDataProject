It consists of negative (the Min and NO systems) and positive (Ter signal mediated by MatP\/ZapA\/ZapB) regulators. Here, we find that N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) facilitates functional Z ring formation by strengthening the Ter signal via ZapB. DapE depends on ZapB to localize to the Z ring and its overproduction suppresses the division defect caused by loss of both the Min and NO systems. DapE shows a strong interaction with ZapB and requires the presence of ZapB to exert its function in division. Consistent with the idea that DapE strengthens the Ter signal, overproduction of DapE supports cell division with reduced FtsZ levels and provides some resistance to the FtsZ inhibitors MinCD and SulA, while deletion of dapE, like deletion of zapB, exacerbates the phenotypes of cells impaired in Z ring formation such as ftsZ84 or a min mutant. Taken together, our results report DapE as a new component of the divisome that promotes the integrity of the Z ring by acting through ZapB and raises the possibility of the existence of additional divisome proteins that also function in other cellular processes.
