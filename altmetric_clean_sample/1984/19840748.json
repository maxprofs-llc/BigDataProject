Using our latest public Dendrobium transcriptomes, a comprehensive characterization and analysis of 14 DnARF genes were performed. Three selected DnARFs, including DnARF1, DnARF4, and DnARF6, were confirmed to be nuclear proteins according to their transient expression in epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Furthermore, the transcription activation abilities of DnARF1, DnARF4, and DnARF6 were tested in a yeast system. Our data showed that DnARF6 is a transcriptional activator in Dendrobium officinale. To uncover the basic information of DnARF gene responses to abiotic stresses, we analyzed their expression patterns under various hormones and abiotic treatments. Based on our data, several hormones and significant stress responsive DnARF genes have been identified. Since auxin and ARF genes have been identified in many plant species, our data is imperative to reveal the function of ARF mediated auxin signaling in the adaptation to the challenging Dendrobium environment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Zhehao Chen","Ye Yuan","Di Fu","Chenjia Shen","Yanjun Yang"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms18050927","first_seen_on":"2017-05-04T04:58:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"5","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1493989423,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/5\/927?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28471373?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/ijms18050927"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/18\/5\/927\/pdf","pmid":"28471373","pubdate":"2017-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Identification and Expression Profiling of the Auxin Response Factors in Dendrobium officinale under Abiotic Stresses","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-expression-profiling-auxin-response-factors-dendrobium-officinale-under-abiotic-stres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":6197816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1097953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236455,"mean":12.568809045311,"rank":167272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236455,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5205,"mean":2.3758597232898,"rank":3019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5205,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":1.6978531073446,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
