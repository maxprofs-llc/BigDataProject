Defects in Hippo signalling and hyperactivation of its downstream effectors Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) contribute to the development of cancer, which suggests that pharmacological inhibition of YAP and TAZ activity may be an effective anticancer strategy. Conversely, YAP and TAZ can also have beneficial roles in stimulating tissue repair and regeneration following injury, so their activation may be therapeutically useful in these contexts. A complex network of intracellular and extracellular signalling pathways that modulate YAP and TAZ activities have recently been identified. Here, we review the regulation of the Hippo signalling pathway, its functions in normal homeostasis and disease, and recent progress in the identification of small-molecule pathway modulators.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003169","authors":["Randy Johnson","Georg Halder","Johnson R","Halder G"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrd4161","endpage":"79","first_seen_on":"2013-12-16T15:34:04+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1474-1776","1474-1784"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","last_mentioned_on":1435852810,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/nrd4161.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrd\/journal\/v13\/n1\/full\/nrd4161.html"],"pmid":"24336504","pubdate":"2013-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Regenerative medicine","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"The two faces of Hippo: targeting the Hippo pathway for regenerative medicine and cancer treatment","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nrd4161","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-faces-hippo-targeting-hippo-pathway-regenerative-medicine-cancer-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307571,"mean":6.2278488272417,"rank":492572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4813727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307571,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138184,"mean":7.5908884595067,"rank":15095,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":123056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138184,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1493,"mean":8.8737372654155,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1493,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.6822702702703,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":18,"Researcher":80,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
