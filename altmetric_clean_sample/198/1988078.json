Herein, we report a photoinduced two-electron reduction of a polypyridyl Ni(II) chloride complex that provides a route to H2 evolution from HCl. The excited states of Ni complexes are too short to participate directly in HX activation, and hence, the excited state of a photoredox mediator is exploited for the activation of HX at the Ni(II) center. Nanosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has revealed that the excited state of the polypyridine results in a photoreduced radical that is capable of mediating HX activation by producing a Ni(I) center by halogen-atom abstraction. Disproportionation of the photogenerated Ni(I) intermediate affords Ni(II) and Ni(0) complexes. The Ni(0) center is capable of reacting with HX to produce H2 and the polypyridyl Ni(II) dichloride, closing the photocycle for H2 generation from HCl.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["David C.
