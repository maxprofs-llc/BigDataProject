At anaphase II, sister chromatids separate. However, studies of small chromosomes in maize derived from a variety of sources typically have failure of sister chromatid cohesion at anaphase I. This failure occurs whether there is pairing of two copies of a minichromosome or not. These characteristics have implications for managing the transmission of the first generation artificial chromosomes in plants. Procedures to address these issues of minichromosomes are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Birchler, James A.","Han, Fangpu"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2013.00505","first_seen_on":"2013-12-17T08:59:32+00:00","issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1387270743,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fpls.2013.00505\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile\/1\/30929\/71759\/1\/21\/fpls-04-00505_pdf","pmid":"24381575","pubdate":"2013-11-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Meiotic behavior of small chromosomes in maize","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/meiotic-behavior-small-chromosomes-maize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505915,"mean":5.1093654012801,"rank":3488596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505915,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114521,"mean":7.5809696472233,"rank":87889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":802,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114521,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2007,"mean":2.1772652043868,"rank":1745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2007,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":1.380196969697,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
