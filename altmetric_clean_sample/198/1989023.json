Our laboratory routinely performed standalone PCR-based methods for mutations in several genes. Rapid discovery and introduction of new therapeutics has demanded additional genomic information for adequate management of the cancer patient. We evaluated a next generation sequencing assay, the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panelv2 (CHPv2), capable of identifying multiple somatic mutations in 50 genes in a single assay.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002551","authors":["Gregory J Tsongalis","Jason D Peterson","Francine B de Abreu","Christopher D Tunkey","Torrey L Gallagher","Linda D Strausbaugh","Wendy A Wells","Christopher I Amos","Tsongalis GJ","Peterson JD","de Abreu FB","Tunkey CD","Gallagher TL","Strausbaugh LD","Wells WA","Amos CI","Gregory J.
