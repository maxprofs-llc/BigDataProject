However, one potential Lewis acid that has received negligible attention as a catalyst is the carbocation. We have demonstrated the potential of the carbocation as a highly powerful Lewis acid catalyst for organic reactions. The stable and easily available triphenylmethyl (trityl) cation was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for the Diels-Alder reaction for a range of substrates. Catalyst loadings as low as 500\u2005ppm, excellent yields, and good endo\/exo selectivities were achieved. Furthermore, by changing the electronic properties of the substituents on the tritylium ion, the Lewis acidity of the catalyst could be tuned to control the outcome of the reaction. The ability of this carbocation as a Lewis acid catalyst was also further extended to the Michael reaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Bah, Juho","Franz\u00e9n, Johan"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201304160","endpage":"1072","first_seen_on":"2013-12-17T17:17:19+00:00","issns":["1521-3765","0947-6539"],"issue":"4","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1390494020,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201304160\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201304160\/pdf","pmid":"24375806","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1066","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Carbocations as Lewis Acid Catalysts in Diels\u2013Alder and Michael Addition Reactions","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbocations-lewis-acid-catalysts-dielsalder-michael-addition-reactions-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":941852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114538,"mean":7.6126902398354,"rank":74717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":25590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114538,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3263,"mean":2.5033372164316,"rank":1676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3263,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":5.0016923076923,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
