The architectures of the complexes were initially proposed according to NMR data Job plot and ROESY followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations of (1)H NMR spectra using the PBE1PBE functional and 6-31G(d,p) basis set, including the water solvent effect with the polarizable continuum model (PCM), for various inclusion modes, providing support for the experimental proposal. An analysis of the (1)H NMR chemical shift values for the isoniazid (H6',8' and H5',9') and cyclodextrins (H3,5) C(1)H hydrogens, which are known to be very adequately described by the DFT methodology, revealed them to be extremely useful, promptly confirming the inclusion complex formation. An included mode which describes Me-\u03b2CD partially enclosing the hydrazide group of the INH is predicted as the most favorable supramolecular structure that can be used to explain the physicochemical properties of the encapsulated drug. Antibacterial activity was also evaluated, and the results indicated the inclusion complexes are a potential strategy for tuberculosis treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Milena G.
