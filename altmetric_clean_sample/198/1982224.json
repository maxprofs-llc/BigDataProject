A nucleus moves dynamically during cell division and differentiation and in response to environmental changes in animal, fungal, and plant cells. Nuclear movement is well-studied and the mechanisms have been mostly elucidated in animal and fungal cells, but not in plant cells. In prothallial cells of the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris and leaf cells of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, light induces nuclear movement and nuclei change their position according to wavelength, intensity, and direction of light. This nuclear photorelocation movement shows some common features with the photorelocation movement of chloroplasts, which is one of the best-characterized plant organelle movements. This review summarizes nuclear movement and positioning in plant cells, especially plant-specific nuclear photorelocation movement and discusses the relationship between nuclear photorelocation movement and chloroplast photorelocation movement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fdd","authors":["Masamitsu Wada"],"doi":"10.1093\/jxb\/ert414","first_seen_on":"2013-12-16T10:36:57+00:00","issns":["1460-2431"],"journal":"Journal of Experimental Botany","last_mentioned_on":1387190199,"links":["http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/12\/jxb.ert414.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/12\/jxb.ert414.full.pdf","pmid":"24336444","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany"],"title":"Plant nuclear photorelocation movement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plant-nuclear-photorelocation-movement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3064484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123582,"mean":7.3863215381008,"rank":80774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123582,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1840,"mean":2.2353398586188,"rank":1334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1840,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.5321428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
