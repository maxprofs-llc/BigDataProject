In the industrial setting, optimization of growing conditions can lead to significantly increased production of a compound of interest. Such optimization becomes challenging in a drug-discovery screening situation, as the ideal conditions for one organism may induce poor metabolic diversity for a different organism. Here, the impact of different media types, including six liquid media and five solid media, on the secondary metabolite production of three fungal strains was examined in the context of the drug-discovery screening process. The relative production of marker compounds was used to evaluate the usefulness and reliability of each medium for the purpose of producing secondary metabolites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ac","doi":"10.1186\/2191-0855-3-71","first_seen_on":"2013-12-17T03:17:39+00:00","issns":["2191-0855"],"issue":"1","journal":"AMB Express","last_mentioned_on":1387250163,"links":["http:\/\/www.amb-express.com\/content\/3\/1\/71\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.amb-express.com\/content\/pdf\/2191-0855-3-71.pdf","pmid":"24342059","pubdate":"2013-12-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","startpage":"71","title":"Evaluation of culture media for the production of secondary metabolites in a natural products screening program","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-culture-media-production-secondary-metabolites-natural-products-screening-program-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2301711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1603468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114537,"mean":7.6114313578266,"rank":54986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":43217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114537,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199,"mean":1.1867676767677,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.90625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
