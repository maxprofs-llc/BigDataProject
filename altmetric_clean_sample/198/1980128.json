Seeking to create a culture of safety centered around patient care, quality, and efficiency, the team used multiple external resources to increase their effectiveness as participants in the design process and to ensure that the new ICU achieves the functional performance goals identified at the beginning of planning and design. Specific focus on evidence-based design was assisted through participation in the Center for Health Design's Pebble Project process as well as the Joint Commission International Safe Health Design Learning Academy Pilot Program.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005853","doi":"10.1097\/cnq.0000000000000008","first_seen_on":"2013-12-14T21:11:14+00:00","issns":["0887-9303"],"issue":"1","journal":"Critical Care Nursing Quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1387055456,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ccnq\/Abstract\/2014\/01000\/WellStar_Paulding_Hospital_Intensive_Care_Unit.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ccnq\/2014\/01000\/WellStar_Paulding_Hospital_Intensive_Care_Unit.8.pdf","pmid":"24309463","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"93","subjects":["nursing","criticalcare"],"title":"WellStar Paulding Hospital Intensive Care Unit Case Study: Achieving a Research-Based, Patient-Centered Design Using a Collaborative Process","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/wellstar-paulding-hospital-intensive-care-unit-case-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123235,"mean":7.3021971371539,"rank":81759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123235,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":1.2308612440191,"rank":121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
