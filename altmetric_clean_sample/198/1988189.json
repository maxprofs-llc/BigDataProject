In particular, our experimental results indicate that this peptide is endowed with a high target-cell selectivity towards yeast species, suggesting its potential development as a new drug against oral microbial infections. To provide additional structural insights, we performed several Molecular Dynamics simulations in different conditions. Results suggest that P-113 is a rather compact species presumably because of its highly charged state as emerged from the dramatic increase of internal fluctuation occurring upon point-mutation. The peptide turns out to adopt, in water, a beta-hairpin-like conformation and, in a more hydrophobic environment, is found to be in a (probably slow) equilibrium between \u03b1-helix and hairpin conformations. Complexation with Zn(2+) induces a drastic mechanical stabilization, which prevents any conformational organization of the peptide into a biologically active state. \u00a9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
