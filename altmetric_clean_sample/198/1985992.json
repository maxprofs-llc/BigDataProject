Barriers to their extensive use include potential for trauma and spasm, extra-operating time, unfamiliarity, concerns over hypoperfusion and deep sternal wound infection in patients in whom bilateral internal thoracic arteries are used-especially diabetics. This presentation addresses these concerns with particular attention to the radial artery, and skeletonized right internal thoracic artery harvest and construction of the proximal anastomoses of these grafts to the ascending thoracic aorta. The facile handling of these grafts and techniques identical to SVG grafting are emphasized. Avoidance of competitive flow and the importance of spasm prophylaxis cannot be overstated. Arterial grafts have patencies >90% at 10 years (SVG 50-60% at 10 years) and once functioning normally, remain free of atheroma. Long-term results are excellent, especially freedom from recurrent cardiac events and reoperations, even in patients with significant preoperative comorbidities such as diabetes and renal dysfunction. Depending on age, long-term survival is between 85 and 90% at 10 years and 75 and 80% at 15 years, and is always better than for one arterial graft plus SVG in all long-term risk-adjusted or propensity-matched studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008204","authors":["James Tatoulis","Tatoulis J","J.
