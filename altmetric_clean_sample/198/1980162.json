It presents with digital clubbing, swelling of digits and toes, and periosteal reaction of extremity bones. It is almost always associated with ophthalmopathy and thyroid dermopathy. During a 26-yr period at our institution, of 178 patients with thyroid dermopathy, 40 had acropachy. Clubbing associated with thyroid dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) was seen in 35 patients. Clubbing usually was not a patient complaint and was noted only by clinical observers. Four of eight patients with hand and extremity radiographs had periosteal reaction. Seven had associated extremity and joint pain; this pain was absent at long-term follow-up. Half of the patients required systemic corticosteroid therapy, 53% required transantral or transfrontal orbital decompression for severe ophthalmopathy, and 18% had the elephantiasic form of dermopathy. Cigarette-smoking rates were 81% for women and 75% for men (mean, 28 pack-years). All 13 patients who had thyroid-stimulating Ig measurement had high titers. Long-term follow-up (median, 12.5 yr) revealed that acropachy was not a complaint in follow-up visits or questionnaires. The data suggest that thyroid acropachy is an indicator of severity of ophthalmopathy and dermopathy. It is a source of clinical concern only if dermopathy is persistent and severe.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["Vahab Fatourechi","Debra D F Ahmed","Kara M Schwartz"],"doi":"10.1210\/jc.2002-020746","first_seen_on":"2013-12-14T22:03:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-972X"],"issue":"12","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1420369072,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12466333"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jcem\/article-pdf\/87\/12\/5435\/9042947\/jcem5435.pdf","pmid":"12466333","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Thyroid acropachy: report of 40 patients treated at a single institution in a 26-year period.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thyroid-acropachy-report-40-patients-treated-single-institution-26year-period"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":899417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3785715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124607,"mean":7.4661185817698,"rank":26891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":97540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124607,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5253,"mean":5.6107143945164,"rank":945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5253,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":9.3770408163265,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":13,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Thyroid acropachy: report of 40 pati...
