Subjects are tasked with controlling the movement of a cursor on a predefined trajectory that is superimposed on a map of New York City's Bronx Zoo. The system is characterized in terms of a suite of objective indices quantifying the subjects' dexterity in planning and generating the multijoint visuomotor tasks. We find that force feedback regulates the smoothness, accuracy, and duration of the subject's movement, whereby converging or diverging force fields influence the range of variations of the hand speed. Finally, our findings provide preliminary evidence that using educational content increases subjects' satisfaction. Improving the level of interest through the inclusion of learning elements can increase the time spent performing rehabilitation tasks and promote learning in a new context.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Paolo Cappa","Andrea Clerico","Oded Nov","Maurizio Porfiri"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0083945","first_seen_on":"2013-12-15T04:16:48+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1387560540,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083945","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0083945#B1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0083945","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24349562"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0083945.pdf","pmid":"24349562","pubdate":"2013-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e83945","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Can Force Feedback and Science Learning Enhance the Effectiveness of Neuro-Rehabilitation?
