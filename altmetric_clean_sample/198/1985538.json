Plasma NGAL is unique amongst the candidate biomarkers of acute kidney injury (AKI) since elevated concentrations may reflect either a change in renal glomerular function or in structural tubular injury or both. In this study, we compared the performance of plasma NGAL in the diagnosis of functional changes and in the diagnosis of structural injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000240e","authors":["John W Pickering","Zoltan H Endre","Pickering JW","Endre ZH","John W.
