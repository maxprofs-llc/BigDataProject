Most patients presenting with hypertensive emergency have chronic hypertension, although the disorder can present in previously normotensive individuals, particularly when associated with pre-eclampsia or acute glomerulonephritis. The pathophysiological mechanisms causing acute hypertensive endothelial failure are complex and incompletely understood but probably involve disturbances of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, loss of endogenous vasodilator mechanisms, upregulation of proinflammatory mediators including vascular cell adhesion molecules, and release of local vasoconstrictors such as endothelin 1. Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated a characteristic hypertensive posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome predominantly causing oedema of the white matter of the parietal and occipital lobes; this syndrome is potentially reversible with appropriate prompt treatment. Generally, the therapeutic approach is dictated by the particular presentation and end-organ complications. Parenteral therapy is generally preferred, and strategies include use of sodium nitroprusside, beta-blockers, labetelol, or calcium-channel antagonists, magnesium for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia; and short-term parenteral anticonvulsants for seizures associated with encephalopathy. Novel therapies include the peripheral dopamine-receptor agonist, fenoldapam, and may include endothelin-1 antagonists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["C J Vaughan","N Delanty","Carl J Vaughan","Norman Delanty"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0140-6736(00)02539-3","first_seen_on":"2013-12-17T14:16:29+00:00","issns":["0140-6736","01406736"],"issue":"9227","journal":"The Lancet","last_mentioned_on":1467018969,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10972386","http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736(00)02539-3\/fulltext"],"pmid":"10972386","pubdate":"2000-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Hypertensive emergencies.","type":"article","volume":"356","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypertensive-emergencies-42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7953275,"mean":6.7183323059095,"rank":3703082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":4072356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7953275,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169572,"mean":7.0348601824607,"rank":65625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":98963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169572,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23209,"mean":26.346009134781,"rank":18579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":4383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23209,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":25.351063613232,"rank":269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ACSmaggus\/status\/412949246086610944","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1985921],"posted_on":"2013-12-17T14:15:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Smaggus","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/438096135807188993\/KKNmeiKj_normal.jpeg","description":"General Internist with interest in patient safety\/QI & Med Ed.
