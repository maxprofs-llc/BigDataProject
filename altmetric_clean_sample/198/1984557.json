The progression of renal disease is characterized by pathomorphological changes that consist of early inflammatory responses followed by tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular and vascular sclerosis. Currently available therapies that reduce hypertension, proteinuria, hyperglycemia, and interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are at best only partially effective. Hence, there remains a need to explore agents targeting nonrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathways. In this review, we discuss mechanistic aspects in the physiological and pathological role of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase, a protein enzyme involved in cellular trafficking and inflammation, with respect to the kidney. We explore the evidence for the use of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase inhibitors as potential agents in renal fibrosis to delay the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002213","authors":["May Y.
