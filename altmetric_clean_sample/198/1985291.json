The report's discrediting of a quality assurance mechanism that had the potential for improvement is a disservice to dying patients. Several of the report's recommendations are puzzling, but two consequences of the report, an excellent review of care pathways and a recommendation to establish a national end-of-life coalition, have the potential to improve care of the dying individual.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f6100021a6","authors":["Claud Regnard","Regnard, Claud"],"doi":"10.1093\/ageing\/aft195","first_seen_on":"2013-12-17T09:09:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-2834","0002-0729"],"journal":"Age & Ageing","last_mentioned_on":1456359952,"links":["http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.short?rss=1","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.full","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.full.pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ageing\/aft195","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24342750","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.long","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171.short?rss=1","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171.full","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171.full.pdf+html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24342750?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171.long","http:\/\/m.ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171.long","http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/43\/2\/171"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ageing.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/08\/ageing.aft195.full.pdf","pmid":"24342750","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"The demise of the Liverpool Care Pathway: should we ban the highway code because of bad drivers?","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ageing\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/ageing\/aft195","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/demise-liverpool-care-pathway-we-ban-highway-code-because-bad-drivers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":71,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":71},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8381513,"mean":7.0626122897557,"rank":129532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8251920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8381513,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172477,"mean":7.1863764697699,"rank":2931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":169545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172477,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1799,"mean":11.70545272525,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1799,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":12.665714285714,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":23,"researcher":9,"practitioner":21,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":21,"Members of the public":23,"Scientists":9,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
