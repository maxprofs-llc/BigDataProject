Several risk factors have been reported for PHN, including old age, severe skin rash, and intense pain. This study therefore aims to evaluate the usefulness of the Self-completed Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale (S-LANSS) in conjunction with previously reported risk factors for predicting PHN. A group of herpes zoster patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0305) were included in the cohort study. Subjects were asked for their demographic information, clinical symptoms and signs, intensity of pain by visual analog scale (VAS), and S-LANSS. They were followed up in clinical visits or via telephone for 12\u00a0months. Nineteen patients (6.2%) suffered from PHN in this study. Using logistic regression, 3 risk factors for PHN were identified: age \u226570\u00a0years, high VAS scores, and high S-LANSS scores. Prediction of PHN using VAS (\u22658) and S-LANSS (\u226515) criteria achieved a sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 78.0%. Prediction of PHN in elderly patients (\u226570\u00a0years), using the criteria of VAS (\u22656) and S-LANSS (\u226515) as well, achieved 100% sensitivity and 57.1% specificity. S-LANSS could be a useful prediction tool for PHN, particularly if combined with previously well-known risk factors and VAS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a84","authors":["Soo Ick Cho","Cheol Heon Lee","Gyeong-Hun Park","Chun Wook Park","Hye One Kim"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpain.2013.10.006","first_seen_on":"2013-12-18T14:20:44+00:00","issns":["1528-8447"],"journal":"Journal of Pain","last_mentioned_on":1413454565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24342706?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24342706?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24342706","pubdate":"2013-10-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Use of S-LANSS, a Tool for Screening Neuropathic Pain, for Predicting Postherpetic Neuralgia in Patients After Acute Herpes Zoster Events: A Single-Center, 12-Month, Prospective Cohort Study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/slanss-tool-screening-neuropathic-pain-predicting-postherpetic-neuralgia-patients-after-acute-herpes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2124952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2232505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119408,"mean":7.5441763883192,"rank":51217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":63190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119408,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":793,"mean":6.5993712121212,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":793,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":5.1309523809524,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
