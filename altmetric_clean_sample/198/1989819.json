We correlate local Q factor imaging with macroscopic device performance and show that, for this system, changes in cantilever Q correlate well with changes in external quantum efficiency and can thus be used to monitor local photochemical damage over the entire functional lifetime of a PTB7:PC71BM solar cell. We explore how Q imaging is affected by the choice of cantilever resonance frequency. Finally, we use Q imaging to elucidate the differences in the evolution of nanoscale structure in the photochemical damage occurring in PTB7:PC71BM solar cells processed with and without the solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). We show that processing with DIO not only yields a preferable morphology for uniform performance across the surface of the device but also enhances the stability of PTB7:PC71BM solar cells-an effect that can be predicted based on the local Q images.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Phillip A.
