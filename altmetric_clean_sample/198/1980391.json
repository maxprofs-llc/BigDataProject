Twelve subjects were studied, giving a total of 21 burned hands (10 right hands and 11 left hands). Each subject received two sessions of SHT assessment, held at 7- to 10-day intervals. Three raters were recruited to observe and assign scores for the patients' performance during the tests. The MDC was calculated based on standard measurement error, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was applied to examine relative reliability. Results showed that both intra- and interrater MDCs were acceptable (6.7 and 6.9 points, respectively) and that both intra- and interrater relative reliabilities were excellent (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.98). According to this study, the SHT was found to have appropriate MDC and relative reliability in monitoring changes over time for patients with burned hands. The MDCs of SHT calculated in this study are useful in determining whether any change in score is the result of more than random error.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fe","doi":"10.1097\/bcr.0b013e3181f93583","first_seen_on":"2013-12-15T03:10:56+00:00","issns":["1559-047X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of burn care & research","last_mentioned_on":1387077046,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Abstract\/2010\/11000\/Excellent_Reliability_of_the_Sollerman_Hand.7.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/2010\/11000\/Excellent_Reliability_of_the_Sollerman_Hand.7.pdf","pmid":"20859214","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"904","title":"Excellent Reliability of the Sollerman Hand Function Test for Patients With Burned Hands","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/excellent-reliability-sollerman-hand-function-test-patients-burned-hands"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3066581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":944774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123427,"mean":7.3529298040934,"rank":81420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123427,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1001,"mean":1.2692,"rank":632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1001,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.90416666666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
