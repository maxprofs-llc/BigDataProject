Wolfe (2012) has previously shown that the response times in hybrid search increase with the log of the memory set size. What enables this logarithmic search of memory? One possibility is a series of steps in which subsets of the memory set are compared to all items in the visual set simultaneously. In the present experiments, we presented single visual items sequentially in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) display, eliminating the possibility of simultaneous testing of all items. We used a staircasing procedure to estimate the time necessary to effectively detect the target in the RSVP stream. Processing time increased in a log-linear fashion with the number of potential targets. This finding eliminates the class of models that require simultaneous comparison of some memory items to all (or many) items in the visual display. Experiment 3 showed that, similar to visual search, memory search efficiency in this paradigm is influenced by the similarity between the target set and the distractors. These results indicate that observers perform separate memory searches on each eligible item in the visual display. Moreover, it appears that memory search for one item can proceed while other items are being categorized as \"eligible\" or \"not eligible.\"","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002350","authors":["Trafton Drew","Jeremy M.
