Advanced Glycation End products (AGE's) may contribute to age-related decline in the function of cells and tissues in normal ageing. Although the negative effect of AGE's on the biomechanical properties of musculoskeletal tissues and the central nervous system have been previously described, the evidence regarding the effect on motor function is fragmented, and a systematic review on this topic is lacking. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted from a total of eight studies describing AGE's related to physical functioning, physical performance, and musculoskeletal outcome which reveals a positive association between high AGE's levels and declined walking abilities, inferior ADL, decreased muscle properties (strength, power and mass) and increased physical frailty. Elevated AGE's levels might be an indication to initiate (early) treatment such as dietary advice, muscle strengthening exercises, and functional training to maintain physical functions. Further longitudinal observational and controlled trial studies are necessary to investigate a causal relationship, and to what extent, high AGE's levels are a contributing risk factor and potential biomarker for a decline in motor function as a component of the ageing process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007387","authors":["Drenth, Hans","Zuidema, Sytse","Bunt, Steven","Bautmans, Ivan","van der Schans, Cees","Hobbelen, Hans","Hans Drenth","Sytse Zuidema","Steven Bunt","Ivan Bautmans","Cees van der Schans","Hans Hobbelen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s11556-016-0163-1","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T19:16:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1813-7253","1861-6909"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Reviews of Aging and Physical Activity","last_mentioned_on":1497252619,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26949420","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s11556-016-0163-1","http:\/\/eurapa.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s11556-016-0163-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/eurapa.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s11556-016-0163-1?site=eurapa.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"26949420","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Behavioral Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"The Contribution of Advanced Glycation End product (AGE) accumulation to the decline in motor function","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.eurapa.net\/content\/13\/1\/3","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contribution-advanced-glycation-end-product-age-accumulation-decline-motor-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.608,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.608},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8385914,"mean":7.0647843498894,"rank":748028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7637792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8385914,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285791,"mean":11.115064361944,"rank":36018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":249768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285791,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.2415813953488,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
