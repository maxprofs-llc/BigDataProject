Currently the underlying mechanisms of the painful peripheral neuropathy remain largely unknown. Here, we found that paclitaxel treatment (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mg\/kg, cumulative dose 24\u00a0mg\/kg) upregulated the expression of CX3CR1 and phosphorylated Akt1 in DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Blocking of Akt1 pathway activation with different inhibitor (MK-2206 or LY294002) significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by paclitaxel. Furthermore, inhibition of CX3CR1 by using neutralizing antibody not only prevented Akt1 activation in DRG and spinal dorsal horn but also alleviated pain-related behavior induced by paclitaxel treatment. This study suggested that CX3CR1\/Akt1 signaling pathway may be a potential target for prevention and reversion of the painful peripheral neuropathy induced by paclitaxel.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003191","authors":["Dai Li","Hui Chen","Xiao-Huan Luo","Yang Sun","Wei Xia","Yuan-Chang Xiong"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11064-016-1827-y","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T22:30:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-6903"],"journal":"Neurochemical Research","last_mentioned_on":1457552544,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11064-016-1827-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11064-016-1827-y.pdf","pmid":"26961886","pubdate":"2016-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"CX3CR1-Mediated Akt1 Activation Contributes to the Paclitaxel-Induced Painful Peripheral Neuropathy in Rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cx3cr1mediated-akt1-activation-contributes-paclitaxelinduced-painful-peripheral-neuropathy-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372886,"mean":6.4056713894184,"rank":6377457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372886,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279041,"mean":10.771912120126,"rank":235471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279041,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":964,"mean":2.6484797507788,"rank":654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":964,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.4666265060241,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/707652778772926464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6148095],"posted_on":"2016-03-09T19:42:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"707652778772926464"}]}}
