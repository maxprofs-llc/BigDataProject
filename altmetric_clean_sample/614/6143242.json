Cerebral state index, Ramsay sedation score, arterial blood gas analysis, and physiology indices were recorded before admission (T0), 30 minutes (T1), 1 hour (T2), 2 hours (T3), 6 hours (T4), and 12 hours after admission (T5) to intensive care unit, and 10 minutes after extubation (T6). Blood interleukin-6 was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nThere was no significant difference in arterial blood gas analysis, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, and respiratory rate between two groups at all time-points (P>0.05). The changes of heart rate (at T4, T5, and T6), cerebral state index (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5), and Ramsay score (at T3) in P-H group were significantly different from that in P-D group (P<0.05). The plasma interleukin-6 at T4 in P-H group was significantly lower than that in P-D group (P<0.05).\nThe P-H approach takes advantages over P-D approach in relieving the pain and discomfort, reducing the overstimulation of sympathetic nerve and the stress level, and enhancing the tolerance of postoperative intubation after maxillofacial plastic surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b5e","authors":["Yanlin Wang","Wei Peng","Tiejun Zhang"],"doi":"10.2147\/tcrm.s99262","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T02:55:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-203X","1176-6336"],"journal":"Therapeutics and Clinical Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1457484222,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/comparison-of-propofolndashhydromorphone-and-propofolndashdexmedetomid-peer-reviewed-article-TCRM"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29329","pmid":"27022268","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Social Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"373","title":"Comparison of propofol&ndash;hydromorphone and propofol&ndash;dexmedetomidine in patients with intubation after maxillofacial plastic surgery","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-propofolhydromorphone-propofoldexmedetomidine-patients-intubation-after-maxillofacial-pla"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372759,"mean":6.4055135958582,"rank":3570792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3615625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372759,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279041,"mean":10.771868757167,"rank":139189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":129283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279041,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":636,"mean":3.6538645669291,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":636,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.1838596491228,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
