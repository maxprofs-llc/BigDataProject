She was febrile (38.3 \u00b0C). She had not experienced any recent head trauma, infection or toxic ingestion; she did not take any medication for ADD. Her physical exam revealed tachycardia, normal pupils, reflexes and normal plantar responses. Laboratory investigations (complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, plasma lactate level, ammonia level) produced normal results. Lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the brain were normal. A serum and urine drug screening (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, methadone, ethanol) was negative. An electroencephalogram, performed during an episode of hallucinations, was compatible with benzodiazepine intoxication. A larger toxic detection by liquid chromatography\/diode array detector (LC-DAD) detected promethazine and its metabolites. Symptoms lasted 20 h and she finally said she drank syrup from an over-the-counter cough suppressant medication. Comments - Anticholinergic syndrome is not well recognized or evoked in children presenting hallucinations. Promethazine is still present in several over-the-counter medications, alone or in combination with acetaminophen, carbocisteine or opiates.\nMedications containing promethazine should not be prescribed in children. Such intoxication can mimic encephalitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007363","authors":["Br\u00e9hin, C","Cessans, C","Monchaud, C","Lavit, M","Majorel, C","Claudet, I"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejpn.2016.02.010","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T23:39:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2130","10903798"],"journal":"European Journal of Paediatric Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1457476091,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26947545?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26947545","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"A pseudoencephalitis presentation of a pediatric non-intentional intoxication","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pseudoencephalitis-presentation-pediatric-nonintentional-intoxication"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367723,"mean":6.4010630515065,"rank":5571431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367723,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280240,"mean":10.742691224276,"rank":196774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280240,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":453,"mean":2.193592920354,"rank":285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":453,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.1648148148148,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/707305652503220224","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6142480],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T20:43:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2022},"tweet_id":"707305652503220224"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/QuneuroLauren\/statuses\/707332109724033024","license":"gnip","rt":["PedNeurBriefs"],"citation_ids":[6142480],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T22:28:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Lauren Jill Thompson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/700484329948884992\/epOQjadu_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"QuneuroLauren","tweeter_id":"4883166094","geo":{"lt":44.22976,"ln":-76.48098,"country":"CA"},"followers":164},"tweet_id":"707332109724033024"}]}}
