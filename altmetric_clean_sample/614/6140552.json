Applying a new protocol, different positions on the substrate correspond to different values of the monolayer surface pressure and specific area. Analyzing the microstructure of the deposited monolayers, we discovered an isostructural solid-solid phase transition between two crystalline phases with the same hexagonal symmetry, but with two different lattice constants. The two phases corresponded to shell-shell and core-core inter-particle contacts, respectively; with increasing surface pressure the former mechanically failed enabling the particle cores to come into contact. In the phase-transition region, clusters of particles in core-core contacts nucleate, melting the surrounding shell-shell crystal, until the whole monolayer moves into the second phase. We furthermore measured the interfacial rheology of the monolayers as a function of the surface pressure using an interfacial microdisk rheometer. The interfaces always showed a strong elastic response, with a dip in the shear elastic modulus in correspondence with the melting of the shell-shell phase, followed by a steep increase upon the formation of a percolating network of the core-core contacts. These results demonstrate that the core-shell nature of the particles leads to a rich mechanical and structural behavior that can be externally tuned by compressing the interface, indicating new routes for applications, e.g. in surface patterning or emulsion stabilization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000898b","authors":["Rey, Marcel","Fern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez, Miguel \u00c1ngel","Steinacher, Mathias","Scheidegger, Laura","Geisel, Karen","Richtering, Walter","Squires, Todd M","Isa, Lucio","Marcel Rey","Miguel \u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez","Mathias Steinacher","Laura Scheidegger","Karen Geisel","Walter Richtering","Todd M.
