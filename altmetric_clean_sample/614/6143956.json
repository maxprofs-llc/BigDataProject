PM","Role of aflibercept for macular edema following branch retinal vein oc OPTH"],"citation":{"abstract":"For years, the standard of care for branch-retinal-vein-occlusion-associated macular edema was initial observation followed by grid-pattern laser photocoagulation for persistent edema. Newer pharmacologic options have revolutionized the management of branch-retinal-vein-occlusion-associated macular edema, and the visual outcomes of these eyes are better than ever. However, a variety of available treatment options including intravitreal corticosteroids and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents have established novel challenges with regard to appropriate drug selection. This review summarizes the available clinical studies with special emphasis on the comparison of intravitreal aflibercept with ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and steroid agents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f15","authors":["Patrick Oellers","Dilraj Grewal","Sharon Fekrat","Oellers, Patrick","Grewal, Dilraj S","Fekrat, Sharon"],"doi":"10.2147\/opth.s98853","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T04:42:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-5483","1177-5467"],"journal":"Clinical Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1459341846,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/role-of-aflibercept-for-macular-edema-following-branch-retinal-vein-oc-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27022238?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29325","pmid":"27022238","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"411","title":"Role of aflibercept for macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion: comparison of clinical trials","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/role-of-aflibercept-for-macular-edema-following-branch-retinal-vein-oc-peer-reviewed-article-OPTH","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-aflibercept-macular-edema-following-branch-retinal-vein-occlusion-comparison-clinical-trials-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":3628106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3648747,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279817,"mean":10.81698644109,"rank":140182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":129197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279817,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1216,"mean":2.1595193415638,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1216,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":2.1904411764706,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePressEye\/statuses\/707395318808096770","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6143956],"posted_on":"2016-03-09T02:39:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Eye","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=22","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294808374\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of eyecare published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePressEye","tweeter_id":"53267341","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":37},"tweet_id":"707395318808096770"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EyeNews_ru\/statuses\/707629654882947072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6143956],"posted_on":"2016-03-09T18:10:31+00:00","author":{"name":"EyeNews_ru","url":"http:\/\/www.EyeNews.ru","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/747009588835328000\/-t2uPxm3_normal.jpg","description":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432 \u0422\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435! \u0417\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u043a \u043d\u0430\u043c!
