Inflammatory response is closely related with CPF-induced neurotoxicity. The present study aimed at exploring whether sub-toxic CPF exposure on neonatal rats results in neuroinflammation that mediated by HMGB1\/TLR4\/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the amygdala. The neonatal rats were subcutaneously injected with 5mg\/kg CPF for 4 consecutive days (postnatal day 11-14) with or without HMGB1 inhibitor, glycyrrhizin. We assessed the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at 12, 24, and 72hours after CPF exposure. The role of HMGB1 on neuroinflammation in sub-toxic exposure during brain development was studied. CPF-treated neonatal rats exhibited a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and HMGB1, and a significant increase in the activation of NF-\u03baB in the amygdala after CPF exposure. Inhibited HMGB1 reduced the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and inhibited activation of NF-\u03baB. Our findings indicate that CPF exposure on developmental brain might induce the activation of neuroinflammation mediated by HMGB1\/TLR4\/NF-\u03baB pathway in the amygdala.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003679","authors":["Tian, Jing","Dai, Hongmei","Deng, Yuanying","Zhang, Jie","Li, Ying","Zhou, Jun","Zhao, Mingyi","Zhao, Mengwen","Zhang, Chen","Zhang, Yuxi","Wang, Peipei","Bing, Guoying","Zhao, Lingling"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tox.2015.10.010","endpage":"103","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T19:54:37+00:00","issns":["1879-3185","0300483X"],"journal":"Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1457460514,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26524701?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26524701","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"95","title":"The effect of HMGB1 on sub-toxic chlorpyrifos exposure-induced neuroinflammation in amygdala of neonatal rats","type":"article","volume":"338","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-hmgb1-subtoxic-chlorpyrifos-exposureinduced-neuroinflammation-amygdala-neonatal-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367723,"mean":6.4010630515065,"rank":5571410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995155,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367723,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280241,"mean":10.742654139309,"rank":196767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280241,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1578,"mean":3.8286442612555,"rank":1372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1578,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.8964285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/707266776610963456","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6141128],"posted_on":"2016-03-08T18:08:34+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
