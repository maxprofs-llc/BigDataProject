The reduced Eu(II) form acts as an efficient water proton T1 relaxation reagent, while the Eu(III) form acts as a water-based chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agent. The complex has extremely fast water exchange rate. Oxidation to the corresponding Eu(III) complex yields a well-defined signal from the paraCEST agent. The time course of oxidation was studied in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo by T1 -weighted and CEST imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Funk, Alexander M.","Clavijo\u2005Jordan, Veronica","Sherry, A.
