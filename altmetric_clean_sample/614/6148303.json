They agree on approaches to case detection and cascade testing, protocols in children, lifestyle and drug treatment strategies, and indications for lipoprotein apheresis. However, most countries in the world still do not have integrated, systematic FH screening programs to adequately detect and treat cases in the community. This study provides a comprehensive overview of recent and future international initiatives for closing the gaps in the care of FH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccd1","authors":["Pang, Jing","Lansberg, Peter J","Watts, Gerald F","Jing Pang","Peter J Lansberg","Gerald F Watts"],"doi":"10.5551\/jat.34108","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T23:24:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1880-3873","1340-3478"],"journal":"Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis","last_mentioned_on":1468281600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26903443?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5551\/jat.34108"],"pmid":"26903443","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"International Developments in the Care of Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Where Now and Where to Next?","type":"article","uri":"https:\/\/www.jstage.jst.go.jp\/article\/jat\/23\/5\/23_34108\/_article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/international-developments-care-familial-hypercholesterolemia-now-next"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":1144682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6916129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283986,"mean":11.031116636442,"rank":56805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":227035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283986,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238,"mean":2.3253164556962,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.8332727272727,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4},"mendeley":{"NL":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drpablocorral\/statuses\/707667623526440962","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6148303],"posted_on":"2016-03-09T20:41:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Pablo Corral MD","url":"http:\/\/www.icm-mdp.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489159168230965248\/wnyBRixn_normal.jpeg","description":"Internal Medicine Doctor.
