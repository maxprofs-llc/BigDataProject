Here the effect of treatment of breast tumour cells with metformin on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) metabolism which plays a key role in membrane synthesis and intracellular signalling has been examined.\nMDA-MB-468, BT474 and SKBr3 breast cancer cell lines were treated with metformin and [3H-methyl]choline and [14C(U)]glucose incorporation and lipid accumulation determined in the presence and absence of lipase inhibitors. Activities of choline kinase (CK), CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyl transferase (CCT) and PtdCho-phospholipase C (PLC) were also measured. [3H] Radiolabelled metabolites were determined using thin layer chromatography.\nMetformin-treated cells exhibited decreased formation of [3H]phosphocholine but increased accumulation of [3H]choline by PtdCho. CK and PLC activities were decreased and CCT activity increased by metformin-treatment. [14C] incorporation into fatty acids was decreased and into glycerol was increased in breast cancer cells treated with metformin incubated with [14C(U)]glucose.\nThis is the first study to show that treatment of breast cancer cells with metformin induces profound changes in phospholipid metabolism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tim A.
