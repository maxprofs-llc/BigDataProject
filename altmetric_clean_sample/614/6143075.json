However, little is known about stent-assisted coiling of poor-grade aneurysms.\nTo compare the safety and efficacy of stent-assisted coiling with coiling alone for poor-grade aneurysms.\nUsing multicenter data on poor-grade aneurysms, we performed a retrospective analysis of 131 consecutive patients treated with endovascular coiling within 14\u2005days after ictus. Patients were split into two groups: stent-assisted coiling and coiling alone. Baseline characteristics, immediate angiographic results, perioperative complications, and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups.\nTwenty-three (17.6%) patients were treated with stent-assisted coiling and 108 (82.4%) with coiling alone. There were no statistically significant differences in patient age, sex, clinical grade, Fisher grade, modified Fisher grade, aneurysm location, and size between the stent-assisted coiling and coiling alone groups. Intraprocedural aneurysm rupture, procedure-related ischemic complication, external ventricular drainage-related hemorrhagic complication, and symptomatic vasospasm did not differ between the two groups. Immediate angiographic results and clinical outcomes at discharge and at 6 and 12\u2005months did not differ between the groups. Aneurysm rebleeding occurred in 4 (17.4%) patients after stent-assisted coiling compared with 2 (1.9%) patients after coiling alone (p<0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that incomplete aneurysm occlusion was independently associated with aneurysm rebleeding (p=0.016), and there was a trend toward aneurysm rebleeding after stent-assisted coiling (p=0.051).\nStent-assisted coiling of poor-grade aneurysms is feasible and safe compared with coiling alone. However, the hemorrhagic complication and aneurysm rebleeding may not be negligible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f61000406e","authors":["Bing Zhao","Xianxi Tan","Hua Yang","Kuang Zheng","Zequn
