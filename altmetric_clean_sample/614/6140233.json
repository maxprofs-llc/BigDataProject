Guidelines were developed and implemented using cycles of education, retrospective review, and feedback. Purchasing and antibiotic use data were obtained to assess changes before and after guideline implementation. Unit-specific days of therapy were measured using periodic chart audit. Segmented regression analysis was used to assess changes in purchasing and broad-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy. The change in median monthly purchases was assessed using 2-tail Student t test.\nHospital-wide targeted broad-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy\/1,000 patient-days during the preimplementation year averaged 105 per month and decreased 33% to 70 per month during the postimplementation year. The overall antibiotic days of therapy decreased 41%, 21%, and 18%, and targeted broad-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy decreased by 99%, 75%, and 61% in the cardiac, pediatric, and neonatal ICUs, respectively, after guideline implementation. Yearly purchases of our most common broad-spectrum antibiotics decreased 62% from $230,059 to $86,887 after guideline implementation. Median monthly purchases of these drugs before implementation were $19,389 and $11,043 after implementation (p < 0.001).\nGuideline implementation was successful in reducing targeted broad-spectrum antibiotic use and acquisition cost. Programs with very limited resources may find similar implementation of guidelines effective to provide initial success, so that putting into practice one of the more resource intensive core strategies, such as prospective audit and feedback, may be feasible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Lee, Kelley R.","Bagga, Bindiya","Arnold, Sandra R.","Lee, Kelley R","Arnold, Sandra R"],"doi":"10.1097\/pcc.0000000000000615","endpage":"193","first_seen_on":"2016-03-08T17:00:19+00:00","issns":["1529-7535"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1484937310,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2016&issue=03000&article=00001&type=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Reduction_of_Broad_Spectrum_Antimicrobial_Use_in_a.1.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Reduction_of_Broad_Spectrum_Antimicrobial_Use_in_a.1.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26669645","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/PCC.0000000000000615","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26669645\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/2016\/03000\/Reduction_of_Broad_Spectrum_Antimicrobial_Use_in_a.1.pdf","pmid":"26669645","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"187","subjects":["criticalcare","pediatrics"],"title":"Reduction of Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Use in a Tertiary Children\u2019s Hospital Post Antimicrobial Stewardship Program Guideline Implementation*","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Reduction_of_Broad_Spectrum_Antimicrobial_Use_in_a.1.aspx","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduction-broadspectrum-antimicrobial-tertiary-childrens-hospital-post-antimicrobial-stewardship-pro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8089090,"mean":6.870452360944,"rank":1609754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6473296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8089090,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285194,"mean":11.021436416742,"rank":71486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":213343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285194,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2099,"mean":2.3966625357483,"rank":235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2099,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.9407476635514,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
