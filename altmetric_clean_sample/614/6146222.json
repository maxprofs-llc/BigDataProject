The reproducibility of the assay method lie within 4% of error. The hydrolysis of sulphacetamide to sulphanilamide and the oxidation of sulphanilamide to a blue product is a first-order reaction while the formation of azo dye from sulphanilamide is found to be a second-order reaction. A general scheme of photodegration pathways for sulphacetamide and sulphanilamide is presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084e3","authors":["Ahmad, T"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T15:26:22+00:00","issns":["0031-7144"],"issue":"8","journal":"Pharmazie","last_mentioned_on":1457529442,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7146062"],"pmid":"7146062","pubdate":"1982-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Degradation studies on sulphacetamide eye-drops.
