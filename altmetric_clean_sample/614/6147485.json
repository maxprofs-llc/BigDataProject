The cross-linked poly(EGMP) gel and EGMP dissolved in solution have similar affinity towards these ions. UV-initiator induced polymerization was used to graft poly(EGMP) on the GO platform utilizing a double bond of EGMP covalently fixed on it. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the GO and GO-EGMP was done to confirm covalent attachment of the EGMP via -C-O-P- link between GO and EGMP. The extent of poly(EGMP) grafting on GO by thermal analyses was found to be 5.88 wt.%. The EGMP units fixed on the graphene oxide platform exhibited a remarkable selectivity towards Pu4+ ions at high HNO3 conc. where coordination is a dominant mode involved in the sorption of ions. The ratio of distribution coefficients of Pu(IV) to U(VI) (DPu(IV)\/DU(VI) ) followed a trend as: cross-linked poly(EGMP) (0.95) < EGMP in solvent methyl isobutyl ketone (1.3) < GO-poly(EGMP) (25) < GO-EGMP (181), the DPu(IV)\/DU(VI) values are given in bracket. The density functional theory computations have been performed for the complexation of UO22+ and Pu4+ ions with the EGMP molecule anchored on GO in the presence of nitrate ions. This computational modeling suggested that Pu4+ ion formed a strong coordination complex with phosphoryl and carbonyl ligating groups of the GO-EGMP as compared to UO22+ ions. Thus, the non-selective EGMP becomes highly selective to Pu(IV) ions when it interact as a single unit fixed of GO platform.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Sankararao Chappa"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.5b11293","first_seen_on":"2016-03-09T19:55:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5207","1520-6106"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1457545783,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.5b11293"],"pmid":"26926256","pubdate":"2016-03-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Change in the Affinity of Ethylene Glycol Methacrylate Phosphate Monomer and Its Polymer Anchored on a Graphene Oxide Platform toward Uranium(VI) and Plutonium(IV) Ions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/change-affinity-ethylene-glycol-methacrylate-phosphate-monomer-polymer-anchored-graphene-oxide-platf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372759,"mean":6.4055135958582,"rank":6377443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372759,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279041,"mean":10.771872699254,"rank":235464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279041,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3525,"mean":1.7458337116913,"rank":2262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3525,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":3.3941971830986,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
