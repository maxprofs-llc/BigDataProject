The analyses reported in this issue were conducted post hoc, pooling data across six previous studies and accommodating the different designs of the six, within-condition, parent studies. Changes in T-scores, standardized response means, and effect sizes were calculated in each study. When a parent study design allowed, known groups validity was calculated using a linear mixed model.\nThe results provide substantial support for the clinical validity of nine PROMIS measures in a range of chronic conditions.\nThe cross-condition focus of the analyses provided a unique and multi-faceted perspective on how PROMIS measures function in \"real world\" clinical settings and provides external anchors that can support comparative effectiveness research. The current body of clinical validity evidence for the nine PROMIS measures indicates the success of NIH PROMIS in developing measures that are effective across a range of chronic conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Karon F.
