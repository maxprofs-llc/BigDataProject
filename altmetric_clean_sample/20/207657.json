The protocol involves deprotonation of N-Boc pyrrolidine using s-BuLi\/(-)-sparteine in TBME or Et(2)O at -78 \u00b0C, transmetalation with ZnCl(2) and Negishi coupling using Pd(OAc)(2), t-Bu(3)P-HBF(4) and the aryl bromide. This paper reports several new features including in situ React IR spectroscopic monitoring of the process; use of (-)-sparteine and the (+)-sparteine surrogate to access products with opposite configuration; development of a catalytic asymmetric lithiation-Negishi coupling reaction; extension to a wide range of heteroaromatic bromides; total synthesis of (R)-crispine A, (S)-nicotine and (S)-SIB-1508Y via short synthetic routes; and examples of \u03b1-vinylation of N-Boc pyrrolidine using vinyl bromides exemplified by the total synthesis of naturally occurring (+)-maackiamine (thus establishing its configuration as (R)). In this way, the full scope and limitations of the methodology are delineated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Graeme Barker","Julia L.
