For Candida albicans, the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in humans, morphological plasticity is its defining feature and is critical for its pathogenesis. Unlike other fungal pathogens that exist primarily in either yeast or hyphal forms, C. albicans is able to switch reversibly between yeast and hyphal growth forms in response to environmental cues. Although many regulators have been found involved in hyphal development, the mechanisms of regulating hyphal development and plasticity of dimorphism remain unclear. Here we show that hyphal development involves two sequential regulations of the promoter chromatin of hypha-specific genes. Initiation requires a rapid but temporary disappearance of the Nrg1 transcriptional repressor of hyphal morphogenesis via activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway. Maintenance requires promoter recruitment of Hda1 histone deacetylase under reduced Tor1 (target of rapamycin) signaling. Hda1 deacetylates a subunit of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase module, leading to eviction of the NuA4 acetyltransferase module and blockage of Nrg1 access to promoters of hypha-specific genes. Promoter recruitment of Hda1 for hyphal maintenance happens only during the period when Nrg1 is gone. The sequential regulation of hyphal development by the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway and reduced Tor1 signaling provides a molecular mechanism for plasticity of dimorphism and how C. albicans adapts to the varied host environments in pathogenesis. Such temporally linked regulation of promoter chromatin by different signaling pathways provides a unique mechanism for integrating multiple signals during development and cell fate specification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003348","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pbio.1001105","first_seen_on":"2011-08-04T14:29:19+00:00","funders":["niaid","nigms"],"issns":["1545-7885"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Biology","last_mentioned_on":1374691834,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21811397?dopt=Abstract&holding=f1000,f1000m&tool=cdl&otool=cdlotool","http:\/\/www.plosbiology.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pbio.1001105","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21811397"],"pmid":"21811397","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Hyphal Development in Candida albicans Requires Two Temporally Linked Changes in Promoter Chromatin for Initiation and Maintenance.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hyphal-development-candida-albicans-requires-two-temporally-linked-changes-promoter-chromatin-initia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574878,"mean":6.0977594546637,"rank":2198811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4354814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574878,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64301,"mean":5.7428827682737,"rank":21498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":42504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64301,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2987,"mean":32.323476892163,"rank":2279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2987,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":29.519292307692,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
