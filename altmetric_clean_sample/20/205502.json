Familial aggregation in CRC is also important outside syndromic forms and, in this case, a polygenic model with several common low-penetrance alleles contributing to CRC genetic predisposition could be hypothesized. Mucins and GALNTs (N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) are interesting candidates for CRC genetic susceptibility and have not been previously evaluated. We present results for ten genetic variants linked to CRC risk in previous studies (previously identified category) and 18 selected variants from the mucin gene family in a case-control association study from the Spanish EPICOLON consortium.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Anna Abul\u00ed","Anna Abul\u00ed","Ceres Fern\u00e1ndez-Rozadilla","Virginia Alonso-Espinaco","Jenifer Mu\u00f1oz","Victoria Gonzalo","Xavier Bessa","Dolors Gonz\u00e1lez","Joan Clofent","Joaquin Cubiella","Juan D Morillas","Joaquim Rigau","Mercedes Latorre","Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez-Ba\u00f1ares","Elena Pe\u00f1a","Sabino Riestra","Artemio Pay\u00e1","Rodrigo Jover","Rosa M Xicola","Xavier Llor","Luis Carvajal-Carmona","Cristina M Villanueva","Victor Moreno","Josep M Piqu\u00e9","Angel Carracedo","Antoni Castells","Montserrat Andreu","Clara Ruiz-Ponte","Sergi Castellv\u00ed-Bel"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2407-11-339","first_seen_on":"2011-08-06T15:11:56+00:00","issns":["","1471-2407"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1312938780,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/11\/339\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/11\/339","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21819567?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2407-11-339.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3176240","pmid":"21819567","pubdate":"2011-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"339","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Case-control study for colorectal cancer genetic susceptibility in EPICOLON: previously identified variants and mucins","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/casecontrol-study-colorectal-cancer-genetic-susceptibility-epicolon-previously-identified-variants-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":2051775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2628097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59186,"mean":5.2361607163977,"rank":22781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":35778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59186,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2581,"mean":2.5151581395349,"rank":701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2581,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108,"mean":1.6937943925234,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
