Inhibitors of cathepsin K are in clinical trials for treatment of osteoporosis. However, side effects of first generation inhibitors included altered levels of related cathepsins in peripheral organs and in the central nervous system (CNS). Cathepsin K has been recently detected in brain parenchyma and it has been linked to neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia. Thus, the study of the functions that cathepsin K fulfils in the brain becomes highly relevant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-12-74","first_seen_on":"2011-07-29T13:02:20+00:00","issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1311938459,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21794126?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21794126","pubdate":"2011-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cathepsin K deficiency in mice induces structural and metabolic changes in the central nervous system that are associated with learning and memory deficits.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cathepsin-k-deficiency-mice-induces-structural-metabolic-changes-central-nervous-system-associated-l-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631090,"mean":4.9276517821564,"rank":2898727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631090,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54653,"mean":4.5666199956086,"rank":37756,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54653,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":568,"mean":2.6619223985891,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":568,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.9970344827586,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
