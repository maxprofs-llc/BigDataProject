Peak replication was seen in the absence of disease on day 1 or 2, depending on the dose administered, and the virus was cleared within a week. Viral antigen and nucleic acid were detected in bronchiolar epithelial cells during peak viral replication. Mice developed a neutralizing antibody response and were protected from reinfection 28 days following primary infection. Passive transfer of immune serum to na\u00efve mice prevented virus replication in the lower respiratory tract following intranasal challenge. Thus, antibodies, acting alone, can prevent replication of the SARS coronavirus in the lung, a promising observation for the development of vaccines, immunotherapy, and immunoprophylaxis regimens.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Subbarao, Kanta","McAuliffe, Josephine","Vogel, Leatrice","Fahle, Gary","Fischer, Steven","Tatti, Kathleen","Packard, Michelle","Shieh, Wun-Ju","Zaki, Sherif","Murphy, Brian","Kanta Subbarao","Josephine McAuliffe","Leatrice Vogel","Gary Fahle","Steven Fischer","Kathleen Tatti","Michelle Packard","Wun-Ju Shieh","Sherif Zaki","Brian Murphy"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.78.7.3572-3577.2004","endpage":"3577","issns":["0022-538X","1098-5514"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15016880","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JVI.78.7.3572-3577.2004"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/78\/7\/3572.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC371090","pmid":"15016880","pubdate":"2004-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"3572","title":"Prior infection and passive transfer of neutralizing antibody prevent replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the respiratory tract of mice.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1128\/JVI.78.7.3572-3577.2004","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prior-infection-passive-transfer-neutralizing-antibody-prevent-replication-severe-acute-respiratory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7048161,"mean":6.2654636061014,"rank":1654886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4557132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7048161,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6450167,"mean":6.5803325489584,"rank":1571939,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4169966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6450167,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6130,"mean":3.985599608419,"rank":1260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3555,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6130,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5211,"mean":4.1890145873321,"rank":1199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5211,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
