To combat such challenges, it was recently uncovered that, shortly after biomaterial implantation, following the recruitment of inflammatory cells, substantial numbers of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were recruited to the implantation sites. These multipotent MSC could be differentiated into various lineages in vitro. Inflammatory signals may be responsible for the gathering of stem cells, since there is a good relationship between biomaterial-mediated inflammatory responses and stem cell accumulation in vivo. In addition, the treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone substantially reduced the recruitment of both MSC and HSC. The results from this work support that such strategies could be further developed towards localized recruitment and differentiation of progenitor cells. This may permit the future development of autologous stem cell therapies without the need for tedious cell isolation, culture and transplantation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000682a","doi":"10.1016\/j.actbio.2011.06.050","first_seen_on":"2011-07-31T14:39:10+00:00","issns":["1878-7568"],"journal":"Acta Biomaterialia","last_mentioned_on":1312121648,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21784181"],"pmid":"21784181","pubdate":"2011-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Biomaterial implants mediate autologous stem cell recruitment in mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomaterial-implants-mediate-autologous-stem-cell-recruitment-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3094823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":972056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58025,"mean":5.0748620915483,"rank":38735,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":10445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58025,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":608,"mean":3.0434233937397,"rank":352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":608,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.67857142857143,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
