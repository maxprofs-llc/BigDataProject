We report that mice lacking gammadelta cells are highly susceptible to multiple regimens of cutaneous carcinogenesis. After exposure to carcinogens, skin cells expressed Rae-1 and H60, major histocompatibility complex-related molecules structurally resembling human MICA. Each of these is a ligand for NKG2d, a receptor expressed by cytolytic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In vitro, skin-associated NKG2d+ gammadelta cells killed skin carcinoma cells by a mechanism that was sensitive to blocking NKG2d engagement. Thus, local T cells may use evolutionarily conserved proteins to negatively regulate malignancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001Sci...294..605G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Girardi, M","Oppenheim, D E","Steele, C R","Lewis, J M","Glusac, E","Filler, R","Hobby, P","Sutton, B","Tigelaar, R E","Hayday, A C"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1063916","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"5542","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1462546218,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11567106"],"pmid":"11567106","pubdate":"2001-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AAAS","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Regulation of cutaneous malignancy by gammadelta T cells.","type":"article","volume":"294","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regulation-cutaneous-malignancy-gamma-delta-t-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":1591929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6015201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7042439,"mean":6.8972450603002,"rank":1517515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5474056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7042439,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39703,"mean":31.575015112589,"rank":20475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":18320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39703,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36936,"mean":33.633545959117,"rank":20173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":15864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36936,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
