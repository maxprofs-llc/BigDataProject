Intrarenal transfer of ECFP\/ANG II was induced in the superficial cortex of rat and mouse kidneys, and the sodium and glucose cotransporter 2 (sglt2) promoter was used to drive ECFP\/ANG II expression selectively in proximal tubules. Intrarenal transfer of ECFP\/ANG II induced a time-dependent, proximal tubule-selective expression of ECFP\/ANG II in the cortex, which peaked at 2 wk and was sustained for 4 wk. ECFP\/ANG II expression was low in the glomeruli and the entire medulla and was absent in the contralateral kidney or extrarenal tissues. At its peak of expression in proximal tubules at day 14, ANG II was increased by twofold in the kidney (P < 0.01) and more than threefold in proximal tubules (P < 0.01), but remained unchanged in plasma or urine. Systolic blood pressure was increased in ECFP\/ANG II-transferred rats by 28 \u00b1 6 mmHg (P < 0.01), whereas fractional sodium excretion was decreased by 20% (P < 0.01) and fractional lithium excretion was reduced by 24% (P < 0.01). These effects were blocked by losartan and prevented in AT(1a) knockout mice. Transfer of a scrambled ECFP\/ANG IIc had no effects on blood pressure, kidney, and proximal tubule ANG II, or sodium excretion. These results provide evidence that proximal tubule-selective transfer of an intracellular ANG II fusion protein increases blood pressure by activating AT(1a) receptors and increasing sodium reabsorption in proximal tubules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002213","doi":"10.1152\/ajprenal.00329.2010","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1522-1466"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Renal Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1312243200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21307128"],"pmid":"21307128","pubdate":"2011-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nephrology","physiology"],"title":"Intrarenal transfer of an intracellular fluorescent fusion of angiotensin II selectively in proximal tubules increases blood pressure in rats and mice.","type":"article","volume":"300","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrarenal-transfer-intracellular-fluorescent-fusion-angiotensin-ii-selectively-proximal-tubules-inc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":2016444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727146,"mean":5.2237768934211,"rank":1476772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":743141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727146,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":693,"mean":1.7202080924855,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":693,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":531,"mean":1.6742716981132,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":531,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
