Assuming that the ancestor we share with nematodes aged rapidly, this means that over evolutionary time mutations have increased lifespan more than 2,000-fold. Which genes can extend lifespan? Can we augment their activities and live even longer? After centuries of wistful poetry and wild imagination, we are now getting answers, often unexpected ones, to these fundamental questions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010Natur.464..504K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Cynthia J.
