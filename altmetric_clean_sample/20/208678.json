We found that the acetylation state of NF-\u03baB, which is regulated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2, is critical for orchestrating the myelination program. Mice lacking both HDACs 1 and 2 (HDAC1\/2) exhibited severe myelin deficiency with Schwann cell development arrested at the immature stage. NF-\u03baB p65 became heavily acetylated in HDAC1\/2 mutants, inhibiting the expression of positive regulators of myelination and inducing the expression of differentiation inhibitors. We observed that the NF-\u03baB protein complex switched from associating with p300 to associating with HDAC1\/2 as Schwann cells differentiated. NF-\u03baB and HDAC1\/2 acted in a coordinated fashion to regulate the transcriptionally linked chromatin state for Schwann cell myelination. Thus, our results reveal an HDAC-mediated developmental switch for controlling myelination in the peripheral nervous system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","doi":"10.1038\/nn.2780","issns":["1546-1726"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1309478400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21423191"],"pmid":"21423191","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"HDAC-mediated deacetylation of NF-\u03baB is critical for Schwann cell myelination.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hdacmediated-deacetylation-nf%CE%BAb-critical-schwann-cell-myelination"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2015236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729028,"mean":5.2124336014302,"rank":1475552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":748375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729028,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2645,"mean":16.763664145234,"rank":1829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2645,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2612,"mean":16.37781769437,"rank":1797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2612,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
