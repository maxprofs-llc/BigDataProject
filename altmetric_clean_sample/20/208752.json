In this article, we report that both systems work together to restrain systemic inflammation in life-threatening conditions such as sepsis. This study indicates that vagus nerve and cholinergic agonists activate the sympathetic noradrenergic splenic nerve to control systemic inflammation. Unlike adrenalectomy, splenectomy and splenic neurectomy prevent the anti-inflammatory potential of both the vagus nerve and cholinergic agonists, and abrogate their potential to induce splenic and plasma norepinephrine. Splenic nerve stimulation mimics vagal and cholinergic induction of norepinephrine and re-establishes neuromodulation in \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR)-deficient animals. Thus, vagus nerve and cholinergic agonists inhibit systemic inflammation by activating the noradrenergic splenic nerve via the \u03b17nAChR nicotinic receptors. \u03b17nAChR represents a unique molecular link between the parasympathetic and sympathetic system to control inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1003722","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"issue":"7","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1311724800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21339364"],"pmid":"21339364","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"\u03b17-cholinergic receptor mediates vagal induction of splenic norepinephrine.","type":"article","volume":"186","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/7cholinergic-receptor-mediates-vagal-induction-splenic-norepinephrine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":2015260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729089,"mean":5.212301894263,"rank":1475560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":748449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729089,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5839,"mean":1.8405142171977,"rank":2500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":2272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5839,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4536,"mean":1.6064348401323,"rank":1548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4536,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
