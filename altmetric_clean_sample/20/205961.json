To address this issue, 228 6-year-olds (134 boys, 94 girls) were each observed playing a board game with a same-gender friend. Ratings of aggression, disruption, arousal and negativity were used to index problem behaviours. Multiple-groups confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the latent factor had the same metric for boys and girls, but a mean that was approximately half a standard deviation higher for boys than girls. In addition, the association between the latent factor and teachers' ratings of total difficulties was significantly stronger for boys than girls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002443","authors":["Rosie Ensor","Martha Hart","Lorna Jacobs","Claire Hughes","Ensor R","Hart M","Jacobs L","Hughes C","Ensor, Rosie","Hart, Martha","Jacobs, Lorna","Hughes, Claire"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.2044-835x.2010.02016.x","endpage":"187","first_seen_on":"2011-08-07T14:45:47+00:00","issns":["0261510X","0261-510X","2044-835X"],"issue":"2","journal":"British Journal of Developmental Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1311766634,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.2044-835X.2010.02016.x\/pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.2044-835X.2010.02016.x\/pdf","pmid":"21592147","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"176","title":"Gender differences in children's problem behaviours in competitive play with friends","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.2044-835X.2010.02016.x","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-differences-childrens-problem-behaviours-competitive-play-friends"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6378189,"mean":5.9866683057946,"rank":3007516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1906889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6378189,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63148,"mean":5.7381435380936,"rank":30910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":20767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63148,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":7.1873709677419,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":7.3851111111111,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
