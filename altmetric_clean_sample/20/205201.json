Previously, we reported that 2-BP has cytotoxic effects on mouse blastocysts and is associated with defects in subsequent development. In the present work, we show that 2-BP induces apoptosis in the inner cell mass of mouse blastocysts, and inhibits cell proliferation. Both effects are suppressed by resveratrol, a grape-derived phytoalexin with known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 2-BP-treated blastocysts displayed lower levels of implantation (compared to controls) when plated on culture dishes in vitro, and a reduced ability to proceed to later stages of embryonic development. Pretreatment with resveratrol prevented 2-BP-induced disruption of embryonic development, both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation of these processes revealed that 2-BP directly promotes ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activation of caspase-3, whereas resveratrol effectively blocks 2-BP-induced ROS production and the accompanying apoptotic biochemical changes. Our results collectively imply that 2-BP triggers the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway via ROS generation, and the antioxidant activity of resveratrol prevents 2-BP-induced toxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Wen-Hsiung Chan"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms12084991","endpage":"5010","first_seen_on":"2011-08-05T22:57:57+00:00","issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"8","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1312583811,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/12\/8\/4991\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3179147","pmid":"21954340","pubdate":"2011-08-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"4991","title":"Resveratrol Protects against 2-Bromopropane-Induced Apoptosis and Disruption of Embryonic Development in Blastocysts","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resveratrol-protects-against-2bromopropaneinduced-apoptosis-disruption-embryonic-development-blastoc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":2325416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1541669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58484,"mean":4.9821168544705,"rank":26508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":22046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58484,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1971,"mean":1.3475005076142,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":1207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1971,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.0181818181818,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
