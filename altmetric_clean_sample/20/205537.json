Different from most commercial clinical trials information systems, which are typically protocol-driven, the DAIDS-ES was built to exchange information with those types of systems and integrate it in ways that help scientific program directors lead the research effort and keep pace with the complex and ever-changing global HIV\/AIDS pandemic. Whereas commercially available clinical trials support systems are not usually disease-focused, DAIDS-ES was specifically designed to capture and incorporate unique scientific, demographic, and logistical aspects of HIV\/AIDS treatment, prevention, and vaccine research in order to provide a rich source of information to guide informed decision-making. Sharing data across its internal components and with external systems, using defined vocabularies, open standards and flexible interfaces, the DAIDS-ES enables NIAID, its global collaborators and stakeholders, access to timely, quality information about NIAID-supported clinical trials which is utilized to: (1) analyze the research portfolio, assess capacity, identify opportunities, and avoid redundancies; (2) help support study safety, quality, ethics, and regulatory compliance; (3) conduct evidence-based policy analysis and business process re-engineering for improved efficiency. This report summarizes how the DAIDS-ES was conceptualized, how it differs from typical clinical trial support systems, the rationale for key design choices, and examples of how it is being used to advance the efficiency and effectiveness of NIAID's HIV\/AIDS clinical research programs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5743cf058f610004cca","authors":["Jonathan M Kagan","Nitin Gupta","Suresh Varghese","Hemant Virkar"],"doi":"10.1136\/amiajnl-2011-000114","first_seen_on":"2011-08-06T16:44:11+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1527-974X"],"journal":"Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association","last_mentioned_on":1391100849,"links":["http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/08\/02\/amiajnl-2011-000114.short","http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/08\/02\/amiajnl-2011-000114.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jamia.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2011\/08\/02\/amiajnl-2011-000114.full.pdf","pmid":"21816958","pubdate":"2011-08-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"The NIAID Division of AIDS enterprise information system: integrated decision support for global clinical research programs","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/niaid-division-aids-enterprise-information-system-integrated-decision-support-global-clinical-resear-9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629051,"mean":4.9368884016521,"rank":1808528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1643835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629051,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55514,"mean":4.5914550465656,"rank":20688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":31850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55514,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":977,"mean":5.9991209016393,"rank":628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":977,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":3.0388125,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
