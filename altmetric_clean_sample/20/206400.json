The probability f(1) to trap a single defect during the normal-metal-superconductor phase transition clearly follows an allometric dependence on tau(Q) with a scaling exponent sigma = 0.5, as predicted from the Zurek-Kibble mechanism for realistic JTJs formed by strongly coupled superconductors. This definitive experiment replaces one reported by us earlier, in which an idealized model was used that predicted sigma = 0.25, commensurate with the then much poorer data. Our experiment remains the only condensed matter experiment to date to have measured a scaling exponent with any reliability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006PhRvL..96r0604M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","arxiv_id":"cond-mat\/0503707","authors":["R.
