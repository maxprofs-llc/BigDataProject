The purpose of this study was to determine whether FM patients, compared to age-matched healthy controls (HCs), have differences in dynamic posturography, including sensory, motor, and limits of stability. We further sought to determine whether postural instability is associated with strength, proprioception and lower-extremity myofascial trigger points (MTPs); FM symptoms and physical function; dyscognition; balance confidence; and medication use. Last, we evaluated self-reported of falls over the past six months.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a3","doi":"10.1186\/ar3432","first_seen_on":"2011-08-04T10:32:26+00:00","issns":["1478-6362"],"issue":"4","journal":"Arthritis Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1402136136,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21810264?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21810264","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3239367\/"],"pmid":"21810264","pubdate":"2011-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Postural control deficits in people with fibromyalgia: a pilot study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postural-control-deficits-people-fibromyalgia-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6373419,"mean":5.842385224696,"rank":997304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5371358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6373419,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63297,"mean":5.6268592960061,"rank":11986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":51173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63297,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1312,"mean":4.5305964912281,"rank":338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1312,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":3.8347619047619,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
