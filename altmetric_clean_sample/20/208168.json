The ATP-dependent chaperone cycle involves significant conformational rearrangements of the Hsp90 dimer and interaction with a network of cochaperone proteins. Little is known about the mechanism of client protein binding or how cochaperone interactions modulate Hsp90 conformational states. We have determined the cryo-EM structure of the human Hsp90:Hop complex that receives client proteins from the Hsp70 chaperone. Hop stabilizes an alternate Hsp90 open state, where hydrophobic client-binding surfaces have converged and the N-terminal domains have rotated and match the closed, ATP conformation. Hsp90 is thus simultaneously poised for client loading by Hsp70 and subsequent N-terminal dimerization and ATP hydrolysis. Upon binding of a single Hsp70, the Hsp90:Hop conformation remains essentially unchanged. These results identify distinct functions for the Hop cochaperone, revealing an asymmetric mechanism for Hsp90 regulation and client loading.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2011.04.023","issns":["1097-4164"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1310947200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21700222"],"pmid":"21700222","pubdate":"2011-06-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Client-Loading Conformation of the Hsp90 Molecular Chaperone Revealed in the Cryo-EM Structure of the Human Hsp90:Hop Complex.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clientloading-conformation-hsp90-molecular-chaperone-revealed-cryoem-structure-human-hsp90hop-comple"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628077,"mean":4.9442940120368,"rank":2017713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628077,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726380,"mean":5.2301486139702,"rank":1477618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":740250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726380,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":4.0852904918033,"rank":1742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2266,"mean":3.614119205298,"rank":1047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2266,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
