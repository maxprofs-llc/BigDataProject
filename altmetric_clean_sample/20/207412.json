Antenna 1 exhibits intense absorption throughout the visible region up to 700 nm. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies showed that singlet-excited-state energy transfer occurs from the peripheral porphyrins to the central porphyrin with >90% efficiency and rate constants on the order of 10(10) s(-1).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Atsuhiro Uetomo","Masatoshi Kozaki","Shuichi Suzuki","Ken-ichi Yamanaka","Osamu Ito","Keiji Okada"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja2050343","first_seen_on":"2011-08-09T02:15:45+00:00","issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1312975526,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja2050343"],"pmid":"21790118","pubdate":"2011-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"110808132004086","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Efficient Light-Harvesting Antenna with a Multi-Porphyrin Cascade","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-lightharvesting-antenna-multiporphyrin-cascade"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":1786745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2632031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58635,"mean":4.9573025207217,"rank":18962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":38287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58635,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15477,"mean":4.1146077797881,"rank":8037,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15477,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":317,"mean":5.6155253164557,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":317,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
