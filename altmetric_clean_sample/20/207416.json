In addition, we find that, for a symmetric PNJ, 1\/4 of total electric current radiated from the source electrode can be collected by the drain electrode. Furthermore, this ratio reduces to 3\/16 in a symmetric graphene npn junction. Our results obtained by the present analytical method provide a general design rule for an electric lens based on negative refractory index systems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011JPCM...23W5302M","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df0","arxiv_id":"1108.1723","authors":["Weihua Mu","Gang Zhang","Yunqing Tang","Zhongcan Ou-Yang"],"doi":"10.1088\/0953-8984\/23\/49\/495302","first_seen_on":"2011-08-09T02:16:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","last_mentioned_on":1312854540,"links":["http:\/\/export.arxiv.org\/api\/query?id_list=1108.1723","http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1108.1723"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1108.1723v1","pmid":"22101167","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["biophysics","nanotechnology"],"title":"Electric Current Focusing Efficiency in Graphene Electric Lens","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electric-current-focusing-efficiency-graphene-electric-lens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.864,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.864},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9089888017246,"rank":410759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3269781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55737,"mean":4.5749627888618,"rank":7133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":48485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55737,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":8.4521,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":515.28,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
