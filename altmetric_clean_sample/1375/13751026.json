The study consisted of: a questionnaire; a helmet and bicycle check (by professional cycle shop staff) and a practical assessment.\nTwo hundred and ninety-three children participated in one or more parts of the study. Of the 214 helmets checked, 41% were deemed 'unsafe'. Forty-one percent of 205 bicycles checked were not considered roadworthy. Of the 127 children who usually ride their bicycle to school, 59% had either a bicycle that was not considered roadworthy or a helmet that was judged 'unsafe'. Of the 200 children, 91% knew the correct hand signals for a right and left turn. Eleven- and 12-year-olds were significantly better at performing the practical assessment than 8- to 10-year-olds (P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\nParents cannot assume that simply providing a cycle helmet and ensuring it is worn means a child will have maximum protection in the event of an accident. Calculations that base the safety benefits of cycle helmets on observation studies are likely to be underestimates. Regular checking of the roadworthiness of a child's bicycle is advised as simple things such as underinflated tyres or worn brake pads can adversely affect handling. There is no specific age at which it can be said a young child is 'safe' to ride unaccompanied on public roads.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea5","authors":["Bromell, Rebecca J","Geddis, David C"],"doi":"10.1111\/jpc.13351","endpage":"148","first_seen_on":"2016-11-17T14:50:28+00:00","issns":["1440-1754","10344810"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Paediatrics & Child Health","last_mentioned_on":1487580607,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13351\/full?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13351\/abstract;jsessionid=A7E373599EF3100C59586816F376AD4C.f04t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/jpc.13351&utm_content=buffer1b6b7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jpc.13351\/pdf","pmid":"27662435","pubdate":"2016-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"145","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Child cyclists: A study of factors affecting their safety","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/jpc.13351","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/child-cyclists-study-factors-affecting-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":3227043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5009381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273986,"mean":12.000085939011,"rank":96822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":176464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273986,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1444,"mean":4.1676632016632,"rank":685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1444,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":4.4457142857143,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
