In this study, we determined the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in red-crowned crane muscle tissues (n = 47). Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) had the highest median concentration (240ng\/g lipid weight), followed by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) (150ng\/g lipid weight), chlordane-related compounds (CHLs) (36ng\/g lipid weight), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (16ng\/g lipid weight), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (4.4ng\/g lipid weight), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (1.8ng\/g lipid weight), and finally, Mirex (1.5ng\/g lipid weight). Additionally, a positive correlation was found among POP concentrations. No sex differences beyond body parameters were observed. Additionally, red-crowned cranes exhibited a high enantiomeric excess of (+)-alpha-HCH, with enantiomer fractions varying from 0.51 to 0.87 (average: 0.69).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Kensaku Kakimoto","Kazuhiko Akutsu","Haruna Nagayoshi","Yoshimasa Konishi","Keiji Kajimura","Naomi Tsukue","Tomoo Yoshino","Fumio Matsumoto","Takeshi Nakano","Ning Tang","Kazuichi Hayakawa","Akira Toriba"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2017.08.060","first_seen_on":"2017-09-16T01:11:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01476513"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1505523056,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28869886"],"pmid":"28869886","pubdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Persistent organic pollutants in red-crowned cranes (Grus japonensis) from Hokkaido, Japan","type":"article","volume":"147","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistent-organic-pollutants-redcrowned-cranes-grus-japonensis-hokkaido-japan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418954,"mean":7.0848786337124,"rank":6388623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418954,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107179,"mean":12.181349512027,"rank":75987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":19295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107179,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1688,"mean":2.5163900414938,"rank":869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1688,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110,"mean":1.1388990825688,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TongueAndrew\/statuses\/908855687375151105","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25403499],"posted_on":"2017-09-16T00:50:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Tongue","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1MEqNtp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/733027133388382208\/cDijhP-4_normal.jpg","description":"Researching avian ecotoxicology in Europe & North America with @UoBbiosciences @NERCscience and @environmentca Views my own.","id_on_source":"TongueAndrew","tweeter_id":"387015195","geo":{"lt":60.10867,"ln":-113.64258,"country":"CA"},"followers":1125},"tweet_id":"908855687375151105"}]}}
