There was no significant difference between tenofovir and entecavir for preventing HBV reactivation. With regards to other outcomes, tenofovir and telbivudine was not included to evaluate due to lack of relevant studies. Entecavir was the most effective intervention in reducing the risk of HBV related hepatitis (100%), HBV related death (61%) and all other causes of hepatitis (98%).\nTenofovir and entecavir might be the most potent regimes in prevention of HBV reactivation for CHB infected patients with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy or HSCT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ca","authors":["Min-Yue Zhang","Gui-Qi Zhu","Ji-Na Zheng","Zhang Cheng","Sven Van Poucke","Ke-Qing Shi","Hong-Hui Huang","Fang-Yuan Chen","Ming-Hua Zheng"],"doi":"10.1080\/14787210.2017.1309291","first_seen_on":"2017-03-31T23:45:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1478-7210","1744-8336"],"journal":"Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1491003918,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14787210.2017.1309291"],"pmid":"28317397","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Nucleos(t)ide analogues for preventing HBV reactivation in immunosuppressed patients with hematological malignancies: a network meta-analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleostide-analogues-preventing-hbv-reactivation-immunosuppressed-patients-hematological-malignanci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":6404230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1147149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249551,"mean":13.214290971749,"rank":178794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249551,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":3.378379585327,"rank":482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.9833333333333,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
