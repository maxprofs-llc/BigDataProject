For many women it can cause vaginal bulge and pressure, voiding dysfunction, defecatory dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction, which may adversely affect quality of life. Women in the United States have a 13% lifetime risk of undergoing surgery for POP (). Although POP can occur in younger women, the peak incidence of POP symptoms is in women aged 70-79 years (). Given the aging population in the United States, it is anticipated that by 2050 the number of women experiencing POP will increase by approximately 50% (). The purpose of this joint document of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society is to review information on the current understanding of POP in women and to outline guidelines for diagnosis and management that are consistent with the best available scientific evidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003224","doi":"10.1097\/aog.0000000000002016","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T01:47:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0029-7844","1873-233X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1492878470,"links":["http:\/\/Insights.ovid.com\/crossref?an=00006250-201704000-00046","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28333818"],"pmid":"28333818","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Practice Bulletin No. 176","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/practice-bulletin-176-pelvic-organ-prolapse-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":4,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088698,"mean":6.8825438942685,"rank":1748610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6282725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088698,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237318,"mean":13.150603909538,"rank":71282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237318,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4699,"mean":11.014874840358,"rank":1722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2928,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4699,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":24.543485714286,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Pelvic organ prolapse","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=773215716#altmetric_citation_c10cd145-f763-467b-91b3-876ce5dd6d13","license":"public","citation_ids":[18364908,18364908],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T01:31:41+00:00","summary":"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), also known as female genital prolapse, is characterized by descent of female genital organs beyond their normal anatomical confines.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=2525879","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Celesteroyce","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Celesteroyce"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/iscgmedia\/statuses\/855820451813130240","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18364908],"posted_on":"2017-04-22T16:27:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Marco Pelosi III","url":"http:\/\/www.iscgmedia.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3200142460\/9db0174e54f6ff9a8e5168c3809e9bf9_normal.jpeg","description":"Cosmetic Gynecologist & Surgeon.
