Interestingly, DNase II has also been identified in a few genera of bacteria and is believed to have arisen via horizontal transfer. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant Burkholderia thailandensis DNase II is highly active at low pH in the absence of divalent metal ions, similar to eukaryotic DNase II. The crystal structure of B. thailandensis DNase II shows a dimeric quaternary structure which appears capable of binding double-stranded DNA. Each monomer of B. thailandensis DNase II exhibits a similar overall fold as phospholipase D (PLD), phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP), and conserved catalytic residues imply a similar mechanism. The structural and biochemical data presented here provide insights into the atomic structure and catalytic mechanism of DNase II.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Varela-Ramirez, Armando","Abendroth, Jan","Mejia, Adrian A.","Phan, Isabelle Q.","Lorimer, Donald D.","Edwards, Thomas E.","Aguilera, Renato J."],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkx222","first_seen_on":"2017-04-01T00:37:38+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nigms"],"issns":["0305-1048","1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1491494173,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nar\/article\/3093262\/Structure-of-acid-deoxyribonuclease"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nar\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/nar\/gkx222\/11157168\/gkx222.pdf","pmid":"28369538","pubdate":"2017-04-04T22:06:23+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structure of acid deoxyribonuclease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-acid-deoxyribonuclease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":3.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":1867481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6115742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233608,"mean":12.990242663961,"rank":74542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":158436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233608,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10588,"mean":4.3856852743931,"rank":2870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":7709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10588,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":7.3689830508475,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1,"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NAR_Open\/statuses\/847971118136705025","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18363694],"posted_on":"2017-04-01T00:37:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Nucleic Acids Res","url":"http:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/575301035507380224\/hvQ8ulSr_normal.png","description":"NAR is an open access journal publishing the latest in nucleic acids research.
