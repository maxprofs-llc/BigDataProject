We have designed our study with aim to explore the c-kit gene mutations in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) breast. To ascertain the range of mutations in exon 11, 13 and 17 of c-kit gene in 53 cases of IDC breast, we carried out PCR-SSCP followed by DNA sequencing. The mutation frequency of c-kit gene in exon 11, 13 and 17 were 9.43 % (5\/53), 1.88 % (1\/53) and 3.77 % (2\/53), respectively. During our mutational analysis, we have detected five missense mutations in exon 11 (Pro551Leu, Glu562Val, Leu576Phe, His580Tyr and Phe584Leu), one missense mutation in exon 13 (Ser639Pro) and two missense mutations in exon 17 (Arg796Gly and Asn822Ser). It seems that c-kit mutations might participate in breast cancer pathogenesis and may be utilized as predictive marker, since the loss of c-kit positivity is generally linked with different types of breast cancer. Further molecular studies are necessary to validate the association of c-kit gene mutation in IDC breast pathogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081dd","authors":["Hussain SR","Babu SG","Raza ST","Singh P","Ahmed F","Naqvi H","Mahdi F"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11033-012-1786-6","first_seen_on":"2012-08-02T06:21:51+00:00","issns":["0301-4851"],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Biology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1343888434,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22729910?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22729910","pubdate":"2012-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Anatomy \/ Morphology \/ Histology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Screening of the c-kit gene missense mutation in invasive ductal carcinoma of breast among north Indian population.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-ckit-gene-missense-mutation-invasive-ductal-carcinoma-breast-among-north-indian-population-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":975778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75190,"mean":5.3553362060939,"rank":48908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75190,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":677,"mean":1.4153905325444,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":677,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.1236875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
