Depending on the severity and location of the muscle strain, different treatment approaches can be taken. This review highlights recent trends in conservative, pharmacologic, and surgical approaches to the management of sports-induced muscle injuries as presented at a symposium held during the 93rd Annual Congress of the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology (SIOT) in Rome, Italy in November 2008. Conservative approaches now include growth factor therapy and administration of autologous platelet-rich plasma during the early postinjury period; however, its use is currently considered a doping violation under the World Anti-Doping Agency code, therefore restricting its use to nonelite sports people only. Topical anti-inflammatory therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy, since it allows local analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing systemic adverse events. As the drug delivery system is critical to clinical effectiveness, the advent of a new delivery system for ketoprofen via a new-generation plaster with a marked increase in tissue penetration and a clinical efficacy comparable with that of oral administration, provides a viable option in the treatment of single sport lesions. Surgical treatment of muscle lesions is less common than conservative and topical therapies and indications are limited to more serious injuries. Presentations from SIOT 2008 show that advances in our understanding of the healing process and in conservative, pharmacologic, and surgical treatment approaches to the management of sports-induced muscle strains contribute to better clinical outcomes, faster healing, and a swifter return to normal training and activity levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068d9","authors":["Angelo De Carli","Piero Volpi","Iva Pelosini","Andrea Ferretti","Gianluca Melegati","Luigi Mossa","Davide Tornese","Laura de Girolamo","Carmelo Scarpignato"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12325-009-0086-6","first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T14:04:05+00:00","issns":["1865-8652"],"issue":"12","journal":"Advances in Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1343829757,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/j3733j3g73514292\/"],"pmid":"20135366","pubdate":"2009-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Endocrinology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"New therapeutic approaches for management of sport-induced muscle strains","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-therapeutic-approaches-management-sportinduced-muscle-strains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4703617,"mean":5.7135412588966,"rank":3940205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4703617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75982,"mean":5.6359252971137,"rank":62936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75982,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":1.9040127388535,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.92619047619048,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
