It has been previously shown that TiO(2) nanoparticles can be used as substrate for MALDI-TOF MS analysis of phospholipids and for other types of molecules, but none of them was applied to the analysis of transition metal complexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f6100086ec","authors":["Radisavljevi\u0107, Maja","Kam\u010deva, Tina","Vuki\u0107evi\u0107, Iva","Radoi\u010di\u0107, Marija","\u0160aponji\u0107, Zoran","Petkovi\u0107, Marijana"],"doi":"10.1002\/rcm.6320","endpage":"2050","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T03:13:29+00:00","issns":["1097-0231","0951-4198"],"issue":"17","journal":"Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","last_mentioned_on":1343445123,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6320\/abstract;jsessionid=B4DE2DB9E12D90E1E291AE225A00E26D.d04t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/rcm.6320\/pdf","pmid":"22847704","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Earth Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2041","subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles as substrates for M(S)ALDI mass spectrometry of transition metal complexes","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colloidal-tio-2-nanoparticles-substrates-msaldi-mass-spectrometry-transition-metal-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6324436,"mean":5.9767388233103,"rank":5382522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6324436,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82221,"mean":5.7501091948431,"rank":67332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82221,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":914,"mean":1.4772573932092,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":914,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kermitmurray\/statuses\/229051565686792193","license":"public","citation_ids":[860465],"posted_on":"2012-07-28T03:12:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Kermit Murray","url":"http:\/\/mass-spec.lsu.edu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/455532058178117632\/I_TcNlsZ_normal.jpeg","description":"Professor of Chemistry at Louisiana State University","id_on_source":"kermitmurray","tweeter_id":"36363027","geo":{"lt":30.45075,"ln":-91.15455,"country":"US"},"followers":402},"tweet_id":"229051565686792193"}]}}
