PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Exercise-induced angiogenesis is a key determinant of skeletal muscle function. Here, we investigated whether the E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute-2 (Mdm2) exerts a proangiogenic function in exercised skeletal muscle. Mdm2 hypomorphic (Mdm2(Puro\/\u03947-9)) mice have a 60% reduction in Mdm2 expression compared with that in wild-type animals. Capillary staining on muscle sections from Mdm2(Puro\/\u03947-9) sedentary mice with a wild-type or knockout background for p53 revealed that deficiency in Mdm2 resulted in 20% capillary regression independently of p53 status. In response to one bout of exercise, protein expression of the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was increased by 64% in muscle from wild-type animals, and endothelial cell outgrowth from exercised muscle biopsy samples cultured in a 3-dimensional collagen gel was enhanced by 37%. These proangiogenic responses to exercise were impaired in exercised Mdm2(Puro\/\u03947-9) mice. Prolonged exercise training resulted in increased Mdm2 protein expression (+49%) and capillarization (+24%) in wild-type muscles. However, exercise training-induced angiogenesis was abolished in Mdm2(Puro\/\u03947-9) mice. Finally, exercise training restored Mdm2, VEGF-A, and capillarization levels in skeletal muscles from obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats compared with those in healthy animals. Our results define Mdm2 as a crucial regulator of capillary maintenance and exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b3","doi":"10.1096\/fj.12-212720","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T11:13:59+00:00","issns":["1530-6860"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","last_mentioned_on":1343473983,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22835827?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22835827","pubdate":"2012-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Murine double minute-2 expression is required for capillary maintenance and exercise-induced angiogenesis in skeletal muscle.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/murine-double-minute2-expression-required-capillary-maintenance-exerciseinduced-angiogenesis-skeleta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4206855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77701,"mean":5.6150336679537,"rank":64233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77701,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2284,"mean":8.8775120455541,"rank":1998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2284,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":12.86,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
