However, the traditional cloning procedure based on genomic library construction and screening are complicated due to the large size (>10 kb) of most biosynthetic pathways. Here, we describe the direct cloning of a partial syringolin biosynthetic gene cluster (sylCDE, 19 kb) from a digested genomic DNA mixture of Pseudomonas syringae into a plasmid in which sylCDE is under the control of an inducible promoter by one step linear-plus-linear homologous recombination (LLHR) in Escherichia coli. After expression in E. coli GB05-MtaA, two new syringolin derivatives were discovered. The complete syringolin gene cluster was assembled by addition of sylAB and exchange of a synthetic bidirectional promoter against the native promoter to drive sylB and sylC expression by using Red\/ET recombineering. The varying production distribution of syringolin derivatives showed the different efficiencies of native and synthetic promoters in E. coli. The successful reconstitution and expression of the syringolin biosynthetic pathway shows that Red\/ET recombineering is an efficient tool to clone and engineer secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dd9","authors":["Bian, Xiaoying","Huang, Fan","Stewart, Francis A.","Xia, Liqiu","Zhang, Youming","M\u00fcller, Rolf"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbic.201200310","endpage":"1952","first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T05:49:12+00:00","issns":["1439-7633","1439-4227"],"issue":"13","journal":"ChemBioChem","last_mentioned_on":1343996258,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201200310\/abstract;jsessionid=6C743E907AC6D4768934AA3854FF33FF.d02t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+4+August+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201200310\/abstract;jsessionid=C90BC91A9B3D51CFACEF13FE4FAFDB2E.d04t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+4+August+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cbic.201200310\/pdf","pmid":"22851214","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1946","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Direct Cloning, Genetic Engineering, and Heterologous Expression of the Syringolin Biosynthetic Gene Cluster in E. coli through Red\/ET Recombineering","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-cloning-genetic-engineering-heterologous-expression-syringolin-biosynthetic-gene-cluster-e-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6324436,"mean":5.9767388233103,"rank":2782156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3374895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6324436,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82178,"mean":5.7868008810251,"rank":36065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":43449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82178,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1475,"mean":2.1071886024423,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1475,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":7.2525,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
