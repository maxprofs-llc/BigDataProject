Many studies have suggested an association between chronic ELF-MF exposure and anxiety and\/or depression. The mechanism of these effects is assumed to be a stress response induced by ELF-MF exposure. However, this mechanism remains controversial. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic ELF-MF exposure (intensity, 1.5\u2009mT; [corrected] total exposure, 200\u2009h) affected emotional behavior and corticosterone synthesis in mice. ELF-MF-treated mice showed a significant increase in total immobility time in a forced swim test and showed latency to enter the light box in a light-dark transition test, compared with sham-treated (control) mice. Corticosterone secretion was significantly high in the ELF-MF-exposed mice; however, no changes were observed in the amount of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and the expression of genes related to stress response. Quantification of the mRNA levels of adrenal corticosteroid synthesis enzymes revealed a significant reduction in Cyp17a1 mRNA in the ELF-MF-exposed mice. Our findings suggest the possibility that high intensity and chronic exposure to ELF-MF induces an increase in corticosterone secretion, along with depression- and\/or anxiety-like behavior, without enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4f","authors":["Kitaoka, Kazuyoshi","Kitamura, Mitsuo","Aoi, Shun","Shimizu, Noriyuki","Yoshizaki, Kazuo","Kazuyoshi Kitaoka","Mitsuo Kitamura","Shun Aoi","Noriyuki Shimizu","Kazuo Yoshizaki"],"doi":"10.1002\/bem.21743","endpage":"51","first_seen_on":"2012-07-31T17:57:42+00:00","issns":["1521-186X","01978462"],"issue":"1","journal":"Bioelectromagnetics","last_mentioned_on":1488425519,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22753092","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22753092?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bem.21743\/abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22753092"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bem.21743\/pdf","pmid":"22753092","pubdate":"2012-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"43","subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Chronic exposure to an extremely low-frequency magnetic field induces depression-like behavior and corticosterone secretion without enhancement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in mice.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/bem.21743","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-exposure-extremely-lowfrequency-magnetic-field-induces-depressionlike-behavior-corticosteron"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":1493290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6798282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95399,"mean":6.0510244868866,"rank":16623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":78713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95399,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":5.2514554794521,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.55,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
