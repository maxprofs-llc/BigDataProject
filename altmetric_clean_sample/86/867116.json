We have limited knowledge of fathers' anxiety during the perinatal period yet there is evidence that the parenting capacity of a person can be compromised by anxiety and depression. The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of a father inclusive intervention on perinatal anxiety and depression. The prime focus of the intervention was to provide education and support to fathers of breastfeeding partners with the aim of increasing both initiation and duration of breastfeeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d5","authors":["Jenny Tohotoa","Bruce Maycock","Yvonne L Hauck","Satvinder Dhaliwal","Peter Howat","Sharyn Burns","Colin W Binns","Tohotoa J","Maycock B","Hauck YL","Dhaliwal S","Howat P","Burns S","Binns CW"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2393-12-75","first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T08:25:16+00:00","issns":["","1471-2393"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth","last_mentioned_on":1402653540,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/12\/75\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2393\/12\/75"],"pmid":"22849509","pubdate":"2012-07-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Maternal and Child Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"75","subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Can father inclusive practice reduce paternal postnatal anxiety?
