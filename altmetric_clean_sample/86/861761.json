Its healthcare system is distracted by challenges and successes in other areas while neglecting to address the onslaught of Syria's cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemic. Despite the official viewpoint touting improvement in health indicators, current trends jeopardize population health, and several surveys in the Syrian population signal the epidemic spreading far and wide. The goal is to counteract the indifference towards obesity as a threat to Syrian's health, as the country is slowly becoming a leader in CVD mortality globally.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c56","authors":["Hani Barakat","Hanniya Barakat","Mohamad K Baaj"],"doi":"10.2147\/vhrm.s28691","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T17:17:14+00:00","issns":["1178-2048"],"journal":"Vascular Health and Risk Management","last_mentioned_on":1333137652,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3310358\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3310358","pmid":"22454558","pubdate":"2012-07-28T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"145","title":"CVD and obesity in transitional Syria: a perspective from the Middle East","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cvd-obesity-transitional-syria-perspective-middle-east"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3095116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":973156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75174,"mean":5.3190747741875,"rank":48635,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":16626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75174,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":2.6921916932907,"rank":245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.45,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
