Noble) phytochemicals on obesity and associated metabolic complications. Muscadine grape or wine phytochemicals were extracted using Amberlite FPX66 resin. Male C57BL\/6J mice were given a low-fat diet (LF, 10% kcal fat), high-fat diet (HF, 60% kcal fat), HF + 0.4% muscadine grape phytochemicals (HF+MGP), or HF + 0.4% muscadine wine phytochemicals (HF+MWP) for 15 weeks. At 7 weeks, mice fed HF+MGP had significantly decreased body weights by 12% compared to HF controls. Dietary MGP or MWP supplementation reduced plasma content of free fatty acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol in obese mice. Inflammation was alleviated, and activity of glutathione peroxidase was enhanced. Consumption of MGP or MWP improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control in mice. Thus, consumption of muscadine grape and wine phytochemicals in the diet may help to prevent obesity-related metabolic complications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Vishnupriya Gourineni"],"doi":"10.1021\/jf3013663","first_seen_on":"2012-08-02T14:17:07+00:00","issns":["0021-8561"],"journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1423632166,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jf3013663","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/22788667\/"],"pmid":"22788667","pubdate":"2012-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Muscadine Grape (Vitis rotundifolia) and Wine Phytochemicals Prevented Obesity-Associated Metabolic Complications in C57BL\/6J Mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muscadine-grape-vitis-rotundifolia-wine-phytochemicals-prevented-obesityassociated-metabolic-complic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":1108148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3926427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77699,"mean":5.6588269453525,"rank":16429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":61211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77699,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4161,"mean":4.9286192307692,"rank":823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4161,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":3.1809056603774,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
