Although the mediastino-pulmonary type is the commonest, the condition may affect the head and neck in a significant number of cases, obliging the practising ENT surgeon to be familiar with the condition. The diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical, biochemical, radiological and histopathological features. We present 10 cases of sarcoidosis with exclusively cervico-facial features which have passed through the department between 1985 and 1996, including a typical nasal case with combined features, and a very rare pharyngeal case. The definitive diagnosis, always with histological confirmation, was sometimes made only after some delay, demonstrating the polymorphic nature of the clinical features, which are rarely pathognomonic. Special investigations, carried out virtually routinely once the diagnosis of ENT sarcoidosis was made, demonstrated only one case of associated pulmonary disease. Treatment was reserved for the symptomatic cases (4 out of 10), and consisted of systemic steroids whose dose and duration was determined by the clinical response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9213cf058f61000d8ad","first_seen_on":"2012-07-30T16:26:38+00:00","issns":["0035-1334"],"issue":"1","journal":"Revue de laryngologie otologie rhinologie","last_mentioned_on":1343665497,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9770039"],"pmid":"9770039","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"[Otolaryngological manifestations of sarcoidosis.
