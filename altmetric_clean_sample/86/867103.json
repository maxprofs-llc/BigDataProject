In these experiments, antiseptics such as PVP-I solution, PVP-I gargle, PVP-I cream, chlorhexidine gluconate, alkyldiaminoethyl-glycine hydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and benzethonium chloride (BEC) were used. PVP-I was effective against all the virus species tested. PVP-I drug products, which were examined in these experiments, inactivated all the viruses within a short period of time. Rubella, measles, mumps viruses and HIV were sensitive to all of the antiseptics, and rotavirus was inactivated by BAC and BEC, while adeno-, polio- and rhinoviruses did not respond to the other antiseptics. PVP-I had a wider virucidal spectrum, covering both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, than the other commercially available antiseptics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070d4","authors":["Kawana, R","Kitamura, T","Nakagomi, O","Matsumoto, I","Arita, M","Yoshihara, N","Yanagi, K","Yamada, A","Morita, O","Yoshida, Y","Furuya, Y","Chiba, S"],"first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T08:12:24+00:00","issns":["1018-8665"],"journal":"Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1491136478,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9403252","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9403252"],"pmid":"9403252","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Inactivation of human viruses by povidone-iodine in comparison with other antiseptics.","type":"article","volume":"195 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inactivation-human-viruses-povidoneiodine-comparison-other-antiseptics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":2174028,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5125542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95995,"mean":6.0837495260121,"rank":24647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":64485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95995,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":655,"mean":2.9126177370031,"rank":104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":655,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Inactivation of human viruses by povidone-iodine...
