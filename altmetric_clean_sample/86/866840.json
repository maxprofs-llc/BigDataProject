They can be released from cells, often encapsulated within extracellular vesicles (EVs), and therefore have the potential to mediate intercellular communication. It has been suggested that certain miRNAs may be selectively exported, although the mechanism has yet to be identified. Manipulation of the miRNA content of EVs will be important for future therapeutic applications. We therefore wished to assess which endogenous miRNAs are enriched in EVs and how effectively an overexpressed miRNA would be exported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Jasenka Guduric-Fuchs","Jasenka Guduric-Fuchs","Anna O\u2019Connor","Bailey Camp","Christina L O\u2019Neill","Reinhold J Medina","David A Simpson"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-357","first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T03:12:37+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1343796772,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/357\/abstract"],"pmid":"22849433","pubdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"357","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Selective extracellular vesicle-mediated export of an overlapping set of microRNAs from multiple cell types","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-extracellular-vesiclemediated-export-overlapping-set-micrornas-multiple-cell-types"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2971977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1399122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75133,"mean":5.3542155406484,"rank":46429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75133,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.3253847276265,"rank":2846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":3.7504683544304,"rank":96,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":28,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
