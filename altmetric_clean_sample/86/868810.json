However, thus far, little is known about the mechanisms underlying coral gametogenesis. To better understand coral germ cell development, we performed a histological analysis of gametogenesis in Euphyllia ancora and characterized the coral homolog of the Drosophila germline marker gene vasa. The histological analysis revealed that E. ancora gametogenesis occurs in the mesenterial mesoglea between the mesenterial filaments and the retractor muscle bands. The development of germ cells takes approximately one year in females and half a year in males. Staining of tissue sections with an antibody against E. ancora Vasa (Eavas) revealed anti-Eavas immunoreactivity in the oogonia, early oocyte, and developing oocyte, but only faint or undetectable reactivity in developing oocytes that were >150 \u00b5m in diameters. In males, Eavas could be detected in the spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes but was only faintly detectable in the secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, and sperms. Furthermore, a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western blotting analysis of unfertilized mature eggs proved the presence of Eavas transcripts and proteins, suggesting that Eavas may be a maternal factor. Vasa may represent a germ cell marker for corals, and would allow us to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells in coral bodies that have no distinct organs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Shinya Shikina","Chieh-Jhen Chen","Jhe-Yu Liou","Zi-Fan Shao","Yi-Jou Chung","Yan-Horn Lee","Ching-Fong Chang"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0041569","first_seen_on":"2012-08-02T02:52:03+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1343875839,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0041569"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0041569.pdf","pmid":"22848529","pubdate":"2012-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e41569","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Germ Cell Development in the Scleractinian Coral Euphyllia ancora (Cnidaria, Anthozoa)","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/germ-cell-development-scleractinian-coral-euphyllia-ancora-cnidaria-anthozoa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":975771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75190,"mean":5.3553667956749,"rank":48910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75190,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80034,"mean":8.2750482675896,"rank":55644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":17028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80034,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3328,"mean":6.1639200480914,"rank":2334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3328,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Ph.
