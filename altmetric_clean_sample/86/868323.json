As abrogation of GM-CSF bioactivity in the lung is the likely cause for autoimmune PAP\u2074\u207b\u2075, it is promising to measure the neutralizing capacity of GM-CSF autoantibodies for evaluating the disease severity in each patient with PAP. Until now, neutralizing capacity of GM-CSF autoantibodies has been assessed by evaluating the growth inhibition of human bone marrow cells or TF-1 cells stimulated with GM-CSF\u2076\u207b\u2078. In the bioassay system, however, it is often problematic to obtain reliable data as well as to compare the data from different laboratories, due to the technical difficulties in maintaining the cells in a constant condition.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","doi":"10.3791\/2742","first_seen_on":"2012-08-01T20:06:09+00:00","issns":["1940-087X"],"journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1345037415,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/2742\/a-cell-free-assay-system-estimating-neutralizing-capacity-gm-csf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/2742","pmid":"21730949","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JoVE","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"A Cell Free Assay System Estimating the Neutralizing Capacity of GM-CSF Antibody using Recombinant Soluble GM-CSF Receptor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-free-assay-system-estimating-neutralizing-capacity-gmcsf-antibody-using-recombinant-soluble-gmc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5421329,"mean":6.3116136326739,"rank":3815034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":910982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5421329,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79565,"mean":5.7493986224926,"rank":52370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":14440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79565,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3495,"mean":3.0568792215226,"rank":2272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3495,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.6416666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
