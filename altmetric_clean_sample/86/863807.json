Here we show that the polycrystalline Li(2)O nanowires were formed in situ by touching and pulling lithium hydroxide under electron beam (e-beam) illumination. The Li(2)O nanowires sustained an enhanced elongation (from 80% to 176%) under low dose e-beam irradiation near room temperature as compared with that (from 51% to 57%) without e-beam irradiation. The extremely high deformability could be understood by the fast Li(2)O diffusion under e-beam irradiation and tensile stress condition. The large elongation without e-beam irradiation implies that nano-structured Li(2)O is ductile near room temperature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012NatSR...2E.542Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["He Zheng","Yang Liu","Scott X.
