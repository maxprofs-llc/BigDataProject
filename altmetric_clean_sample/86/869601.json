While efficacious vaccines to reduce the sexual acquisition of these high-risk HPVs have recently been introduced, no virus-targeted therapies exist for those already exposed and infected. Considering the oncogenic role of the transforming (E6 and E7) genes of high-risk HPVs in the slow pathogenesis of cervical cancer, we hypothesize that timely disruption or abolition of HPV genome expression within pre-cancerous lesions identified at screening may reverse neoplasia. We aimed to derive model zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) for mutagenesis of the genomes of two high-risk HPV (types 16 & 18).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a1","authors":["Wayengera M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1742-4682-9-30","first_seen_on":"2012-08-02T13:19:13+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling","last_mentioned_on":1343912752,"links":["http:\/\/www.tbiomed.com\/content\/pdf\/1742-4682-9-30.pdf"],"pmid":"22840184","pubdate":"2012-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"startpage":"30","subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Zinc finger arrays binding human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 genomic DNA: precursors of gene-therapeutics for in-situ reversal of associated cervical neoplasia.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zinc-finger-arrays-binding-human-papillomavirus-types-16-18-genomic-dna-precursors-genetherapeutics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":3107681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":975790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75190,"mean":5.3550190054396,"rank":48906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":17553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75190,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164,"mean":2.9412515337423,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
