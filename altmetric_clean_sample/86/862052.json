These warnings are based on case reports and there is controversy about the association. While spontaneous reporting of suicide-related events attributed to LTMA has risen dramatically, these data may be biased by the warnings. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between LTMA and suicide deaths using event data preceding the Food and Drug Administration warnings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc00","authors":["Schumock GT","Gibbons RD","Lee TA","Joo MJ","Valuck RJ","Stayner LT"],"doi":"10.2147\/dhps.s23665","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T17:26:10+00:00","issns":["1179-1365"],"journal":"Drug, Healthcare and Patient Safety","last_mentioned_on":1327971652,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22046105?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3202760\/?tool=pmcentrez"],"pmcid":"PMC3202760","pmid":"22046105","pubdate":"2010-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Relationship between leukotriene-modifying agent prescriptions dispensed and rate of suicide deaths by county in the US","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-leukotrienemodifying-agent-prescriptions-dispensed-rate-suicide-deaths-county"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2081713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77702,"mean":5.6149678382518,"rank":26373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":49794,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77702,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":3.1387222222222,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.306,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
