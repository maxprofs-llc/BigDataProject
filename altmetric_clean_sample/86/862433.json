(via #pubmedontap)"],"citation":{"abstract":"The inflammatory process seen in multiple sclerosis is due to an excess production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferons, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, HMGB1 (high mobility group B1), and, possibly, a reduction in antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 that leads to increased secretion of reactive oxygen species, including nitric oxide, resulting in neuronal damage. It is suggested that failure of production of adequate amounts of resolution-inducing molecules lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins that suppress inflammation and reactive oxygen species production, enhance wound healing, and have neuroprotective properties results in inappropriate inflammation and delay in the healing\/repair process, and so neuronal damage continues, as seen in multiple sclerosis. Hence, methods designed to enhance the production and\/or administration of lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins may form a new approach in the prevention and treatment of multiple sclerosis and other similar autoimmune diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f610003215","authors":["Das UN"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nut.2011.12.016","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T23:51:46+00:00","issns":["0899-9007"],"issue":"","journal":"Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1343538196,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22521616?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"22521616","pubdate":"2012-04-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Is multiple sclerosis a proresolution deficiency disorder?","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sepsis-proresolution-deficiency-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628758,"mean":4.9386506288559,"rank":1789627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1819919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628758,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72143,"mean":4.9909112583516,"rank":28173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":43344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72143,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":862,"mean":5.8048176538908,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":862,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":6.03432,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
