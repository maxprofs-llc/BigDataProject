These linear models imply that there is no limit to human performance and that, based on projected estimates, women will eventually run faster than men. The purpose of this article is to assess whether a more biologically sound, flattened \"S-shaped\" curve could provide a better and more interpretable fit to the data, suggesting that running world records could reach their asymptotic limits some time in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5033cf058f61000309f","authors":["Nevill AM","Whyte G"],"first_seen_on":"2012-07-31T12:25:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0195-9131"],"issue":"10","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1503590400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16260981","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/16260981\/?i=6&from=whyte%20g%20nevill%20a","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16260981"],"pmid":"16260981","pubdate":"2005-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Are there limits to running world records?","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/limits-running-world-records"},"altmetric_score":{"score":39.78,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":5.08,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":39.78},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":236707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8186177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95814,"mean":6.0788668969765,"rank":2260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":93554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95814,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2852,"mean":18.038856541564,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2852,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":22.439580246914,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
