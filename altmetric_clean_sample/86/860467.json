In situ Fe K-edge energy-dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ED-XAS) measurements were made on Fe(II)Cl(2) aqueous solutions to 773\u2005K in order to study the kinetics of high-temperature reactions of Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) ions with transient radiolysis species. The radiolytic reactions in a fluid sample within a hydrothermal diamond anvil cell result in oxidation of the Fe(2+) ion at 573\u2005K and reduction of Fe(3+) at temperatures between 673 and 773\u2005K and of the Fe(2+) ion at 773\u2005K. The edge-energy drift evident in the ED-XAS data directly reflects the kinetics of reactions resulting in oxidation and\/or reduction of the Fe(2+) and Fe(3+) ions in the aqueous solutions at high temperatures. The oxidation and reduction trends are found to be highly consistent, making reliable determinations of reaction kinetics possible.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Aquilanti, G."],"doi":"10.1107\/s0909049512029093","first_seen_on":"2012-07-28T03:21:14+00:00","issns":["0909-0495"],"journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1343444947,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?hf5204&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2012\/05\/00\/hf5204\/hf5204.pdf","pmid":"22898960","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
