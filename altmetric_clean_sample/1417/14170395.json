The symbol nomenclature for glycans (SNFG) contains 67 different monosaccharides represented using various colors and geometric shapes. A simple tool to convert International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) format text to SNFG will be useful for sketching glycans and glycopeptides. Such code can also enable the development of more sophisticated applications, where the visual representation of carbohydrate structures is necessary. To address this need, the current manuscript describes DrawGlycan-SNFG, a freely available, platform-independent, open-source tool. It allows: i. the display of glycans and glycopeptides from IUPAC-condensed text inputs and ii. the depiction of glycan and glycopeptide fragments. The online version of this program is provided with a user-friendly web interface at www.virtualglycome.org\/DrawGlycan Downloadable, stand-alone\u00a0GUI (Graphical User Interface) version and the program source code are also available from this repository. DrawGlycan-SNFG will be useful for experimentalists looking for a ready to use, simple program for sketching carbohydrates and for software developers interested in incorporating SNFG into their program suite.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000297c","authors":["Kai Cheng","Yusen Zhou","Sriram Neelamegham","Cheng, Kai","Zhou, Yusen","Neelamegham, Sriram"],"doi":"10.1093\/glycob\/cww115","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T01:47:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1460-2423","0959-6658"],"issue":"3","journal":"Glycobiology","last_mentioned_on":1492179496,"links":["http:\/\/glycob.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/glycob.cww115.abstract","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/glycob\/article-lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/glycob\/cww115"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/glycob.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/glycob.cww115.full.pdf","pmid":"27979998","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/drawglycansnfg-robust-tool-render-glycans-glycopeptides-fragmentation-information"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.8,"score_history":{"1y":4.8,"6m":4.55,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":1623885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6443542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262685,"mean":12.181615431468,"rank":72200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":190152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262685,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":585,"mean":3.5503287671233,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":585,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
