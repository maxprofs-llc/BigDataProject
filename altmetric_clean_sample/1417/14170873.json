There is no doubt as to the value of complete surgical excision for desmoid-type fibromatosis. However, in pediatric patients, surgeons may often be concerned about making a wide excision because of the potential for functional morbidity. Some studies have reported a lack of correlation between margin status and recurrence. Therefore, we discussed our findings with a focus on the state of surgical margins.\nWe report an unusual case of a 9-month-old Japanese girl who prior to presenting at our hospital underwent debulking surgery twice with chemotherapy for desmoid-type fibromatosis of the tongue at another hospital. We performed a partial glossectomy and simultaneous reconstruction with local flap and achieved microscopic complete resection. We also reviewed available literature of pediatric desmoid-type fibromatosis in the head and neck.\nWe described successful treatment for the refractory case of pediatric desmoid-type fibromatosis. The review results showed that some microscopic incomplete resections of tumors in pediatric patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis tended to be acceptable with surgical treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000858","authors":["Hidetaka Miyashita","Seiji Asoda","Tomoya Soma","Kanako Munakata","Masaki Yazawa","Taneaki Nakagawa","Hiromasa Kawana"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13256-016-0949-9","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T02:29:24+00:00","issns":["1752-1947"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1480472946,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4902910\/pdf\/13256_2016_Article_949.pdf"],"pmcid":"PMC4902910","pmid":"27286970","pubdate":"2016-11-30T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Desmoid-type fibromatosis of the head and neck in children: a case report and review of the literature","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/desmoidtype-fibromatosis-head-neck-children-case-report-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":4097600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2180358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250579,"mean":12.181393234841,"rank":137632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250579,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1452,"mean":3.2143804272915,"rank":547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1452,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":0.945,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cabeza_cuello\/statuses\/803787912034873345","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14170873],"posted_on":"2016-11-30T02:29:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cabeza y Cuello","url":"http:\/\/tumorescabezaycuello.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/752225693812027395\/GFLbOaGI_normal.jpg","description":"Informaci\u00f3n acerca de temas de cirug\u00eda y oncologia de cabeza y cuello","id_on_source":"cabeza_cuello","tweeter_id":"752206760438530048","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":91},"tweet_id":"803787912034873345"}]}}
