Current treatment regimens result in curing approximately 50% to 60% of patients with DLBCL. In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration approved rituximab for use in the first-line treatment of patients with DLBCL in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. Since then, no other agents have been approved for the treatment of DLBCL. This article reviews recent data on the most promising agents in development for the treatment of DLBCL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005940","authors":["Younes, Anas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.hoc.2016.07.007","endpage":"1237","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T03:04:24+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1558-1977","08898588"],"issue":"6","journal":"Hematology\/oncology clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1483617680,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27888877","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27888877\/"],"pmid":"27888877","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1229","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Promising Novel Agents for Aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/promising-novel-agents-aggressive-bcell-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":3300849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4636166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259917,"mean":12.091321280721,"rank":103502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":154163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259917,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185,"mean":2.5373586956522,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
