Cells of strain Acr-14T were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile, poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate-accumulating, rod-shaped and formed creamy white colonies. Optimal growth occurred at 30\u2009\u00b0C, pH 7 and in the presence of 2\u200a% NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Acr-14T belonged to the genus Endozoicomonas and was most closely related to Endozoicomonas atrinae WP70T with sequence similarity of 96.7\u200a%. Strain Acr-14T contained summed feature 3 (C16\u200a:\u200a1\u03c97c and\/or C16\u200a:\u200a1\u03c96c), summed feature 8 (C18\u200a:\u200a1\u03c97c and\/or C18\u200a:\u200a1\u03c96c) and C16\u200a:\u200a0 as the predominant fatty acids. The predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-9. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain Acr-14T was 49.1\u2009mol%. Differential phenotypic properties, together with the phylogenetic inference, demonstrated that strain Acr-14T should be classified as a novel species of the genus Endozoicomonas, for which the name Endozoicomonas acroporae sp. nov. is presented. The type strain is Acr-14T (=BCRC 80922T=LMG 29482T=KCTC 42901T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Shih-Yi Sheu","Kai-Rou Lin","Ming-yuan Hsu","Der-Shyan Sheu","Sen-Lin Tang","Wen-Ming Chen"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijsem.0.002194","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T12:59:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1466-5026","1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1504875545,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28879847?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28879847","pubdate":"2017-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Endozoicomonas acroporae sp. nov., isolated from Acropora coral","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endozoicomonas-acroporae-sp-nov-isolated-acropora-coral"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":7249288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123543,"mean":11.934655793172,"rank":100577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123543,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3900,"mean":2.757263400872,"rank":3225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3900,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":1.6035537190083,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
