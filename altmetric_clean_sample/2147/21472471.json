Methods In a prospective case control study, surveillance cultures for MDR bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], MDR Gram-negative bacteria [MRGN]) were analysed between October 2015 and June 2016 from a cohort of 50 pregnant refugee women and 50 resident controls in the obstetric unit of a German tertiary referral hospital. Results Prevalence of MRSA was noticeably higher among refugee women compared to residents (6 vs. 0%). In addition, a trend towards a higher prevalence of VRE and MDR Gram-negative bacteria in refugees was shown (1.8 vs. 0%). Conclusions Due to the higher prevalence of MDR bacteria, surveillance cultures are justified in order to prevent nosocomial spread of MDR bacteria.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d65","authors":["de Murcia, Kathrin","Glatz, Birgit","Willems, Stephanie","Kossow, Annelene","Strobel, Marlit","St\u00fchmer, Bianca","Schaumburg, Frieder","Mellmann, Alexander","Kipp, Frank","Schmitz, Ralf","M\u00f6llers, Mareike","de Murcia, Kathrin","Glatz, Birgit","Willems, Stephanie","Kossow, Annelene","Strobel, Marlit","St\u00fchmer, Bianca","Schaumburg, Frieder","Mellmann, Alexander","Kipp, Frank","Schmitz, Ralf","M\u00f6llers, Mareike"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0043-102579","first_seen_on":"2017-07-02T07:47:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0948-2393","1439-1651"],"issue":"3","journal":"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Geburtshilfe und Neonatologie","last_mentioned_on":1498981629,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28666305\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28666305","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Thieme Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["perinatology"],"title":"Prevalence of Multidrug Resistant Bacteria in Refugees: A Prospective Case Control Study in an Obstetric Cohort","type":"article","volume":"221","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-multidrug-resistant-bacteria-refugees-prospective-case-control-study-obstetric-cohort"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6414623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236495,"mean":12.972552639813,"rank":168552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236495,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.3597826086957,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsawatch\/statuses\/881418954815582208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21472471],"posted_on":"2017-07-02T07:47:09+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA Watch","url":"http:\/\/tahilla.typepad.com\/mrsawatch","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222035691\/MRSA_9_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA News","id_on_source":"mrsawatch","tweeter_id":"41137185","geo":{"lt":48.85341,"ln":2.3488,"country":"FR"},"followers":1141},"tweet_id":"881418954815582208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mrsainfection\/statuses\/881418953821696000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21472471],"posted_on":"2017-07-02T07:47:09+00:00","author":{"name":"MRSA INFECTION","url":"http:\/\/www.mrsainfection.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1222048374\/MRSA_6_normal.jpg","description":"MRSA Information","id_on_source":"mrsainfection","tweeter_id":"36626253","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":732},"tweet_id":"881418953821696000"}]}}
