We report patterns of attendance at Mother Support Groups (MSGs) sessions among women and mothers living with HIV in rural Zimbabwe.\nIn the Elimination of Pediatric AIDS cluster-randomized trial, MSGs were established in 14 health facilities in Mutare and Makoni districts. Patterns of attendance at MSG sessions were categorized by calendar attendance from delivery to 6-month postpartum using a Dynamic Time Warping clustering method. Baseline characteristics of women and postpartum MSG attendance patterns were described. Linkages between these patterns and 12-month postpartum retention in care were explored using mixed-effects models.\nMost women (88%) attended at least 1 MSG session between enrollment and 6-month postpartum. Two patterns of postpartum MSG attendance, \"Regular Attendance\" and \"Non-Regular Attendance,\" were readily identified. Being older than 32 (P = 0.01), booking for antenatal care before 22 weeks gestational age (P = 0.02), and being on antiretroviral therapy at first antenatal care booking (P = 0.01) were significantly associated with \"Regular Attendance.\" \"Regular Attendance\" at MSG sessions during the 6-month postpartum period was significantly associated with better retention in care at 12 months, compared with \"Non-Regular Attendance\" (P < 0.01).\nWomen living with HIV attended MSG sessions. However, few attended regularly. Younger and newly diagnosed women were less likely to attend postpartum MSG sessions or remain in care at 12 months postpartum. Peer support models should consider specific needs of these women, especially in rural areas, in order for MSGs to contribute to improve maternal and child health outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c37","authors":["Joanna Orne-Gliemann","H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Font","Talent Maphosa","Abigail Kangwende","Simba Rusakaniko","Vhumani Magezi","Tonderai Sengai","Bridget Shumba","Pemberai Zambezi","Geoff Foster"],"doi":"10.1097\/qai.0000000000001348","first_seen_on":"2017-07-02T06:50:18+00:00","issns":["1525-4135"],"journal":"JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes","last_mentioned_on":1500402014,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28498192"],"pmid":"28498192","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Patterns of Attendance at Mother Support Groups in Zimbabwe.
