Thai women of childbearing age have an increased risk of anaemia due to several factors including underlying health problems, lifestyles and poor diet. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of anaemia among female students of Chulalongkorn University (aged 18-22) and categorized causes of the anaemia.\n400 Thai female student-volunteers, without known underlying diseases were subjected to blood tests; complete blood count, Haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level. Bloods, having haemoglobin under 12\u2005g\/dl and hematocrit under 36%, were designated as anaemia. Then causes of anaemia are categorized into 3 groups; Iron deficiency, Thalassemia and Others.\nWe found that 21% of the volunteers were anaemic. In 85 anaemic volunteers, they were classified as Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA); with low serum ferritin levels 42.4%, Thalassemia; total of 6 types 25.9%, IDA and Thalassemia 2.3% and Others 29.4% in which haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level were normal.\nIron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the major cause of anaemia in Thai female students in our study. Several students were gradually developing anaemia where their haematocrit (Hct) and haemaglobin (Hb) were within reference range but mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemaglobin (MCH) and serum ferritin fell below reference range, indicating latent iron deficiency. A few volunteers had both IDA and Thalassemia and also Thalassemia with iron overloaded where health can be deteriorated without knowledge of having these conditions or proper health care. To improve their health, universities or public organizations should provide education and\/or screen for anaemia. With the knowledge and understanding of their health issues or underling diseases, students themselves can prevent serious health conditions, improve university performances, and improve their quality of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001286","authors":["Sirikalaya Brimson","Yaneenart Suwanwong","James M.
