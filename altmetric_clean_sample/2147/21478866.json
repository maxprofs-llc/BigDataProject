Biomedical grade of zirconia reveals potential mechanical features of oxide ceramics. In this study, antimicrobial activity and anti-tooth decay applications of the synthesized NPs of ZrO2 were determined. The as-prepared ZrO2 NPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR and XRD, which determined the formation of ZrO2NPs and their crystalline nature. SEM analysis further revealed spherical shaped NPs and TEM analysis determined the size of the particles in the range of 15-21\u00a0nm, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of the synthesized ZrO2NPs was examined against gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), respectively. The synthesized ZrO2NPs displayed a better inhibitory action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (inhibition zone size of 20\u00a0mm) at the concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml compared to other bacteria due to the negatively charged P. aeruginosa cell wall readily attracting positively charged ZrO2NPs and thereby inhibiting microbial actions. Moreover, the concentration of ZrO2NPs was directly proportional to their inhibitory actions against the tested microorganisms. Finally, the preventive role of ZrO2NPs in a tooth decay pathway has been elucidated. Hence, it could be concluded that the as-prepared ZrO2NPs possess viable biomedical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c4","authors":["Fathima, John Bani","Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan","Venis, Rose"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micpath.2017.06.039","first_seen_on":"2017-07-02T20:48:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0882-4010","1096-1208"],"journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1499028486,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28666841?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28666841","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Synthesis and characterization of ZrO 2  nanoparticles-antimicrobial activity and their prospective role in dental care","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-characterization-zro-2-nanoparticlesantimicrobial-activity-prospective-role-dental-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4517979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236495,"mean":12.972488790413,"rank":132205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236495,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":2.678140556369,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.0744927536232,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/881615488001785856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21478866],"posted_on":"2017-07-02T20:48:06+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
