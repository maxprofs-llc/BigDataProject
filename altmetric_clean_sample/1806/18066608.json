Mortality is particularly marked in the elderly and with pre-existing CKD. Oxidative stress is a common theme in models of AKI induced by ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury. We recently characterized an intracellular isoform of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) induced by oxidative stress-mediated activation of an alternate promoter in the first intron of the MMP-2 gene. This generates an N-terminal truncated MMP-2 isoform (NTT-MMP-2) that is intracellular and associated with mitochondria. The NTT-MMP-2 isoform is expressed in kidneys of 14 month old mice and in a mouse model of coronary atherosclerosis and heart failure with CKD. We recently determined that NTT-MMP-2 is induced in human renal transplants with delayed graft function and correlated with tubular cell necrosis. To determine mechanism(s) of action, we generated proximal tubule cell-specific NTT-MMP-2 transgenic mice. While morphologically normal at the light microscopic level at 4 months, ultrastructural studies revealed foci of tubular epithelial cell necrosis, the mitochondrial permeability transition and mitophagy. To determine if NTT-MMP-2 expression enhances sensitivity to I\/R injury, we performed unilateral I\/R to induce mild tubular injury in wild type mice. In contrast, expression of the NTT-MMP-2 isoform resulted in a dramatic increase in tubular cell necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. NTT-MMP-2 mice had enhanced expression of innate immunity genes and release of danger-associated molecular pattern molecules. We conclude that NTT-MMP-2 \"primes\" the kidney to enhanced susceptibility to I\/R injury via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. NTT-MMP-2 may be a novel AKI treatment target.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002213","authors":["Ceron, Carla S","Baligand, Celine","Joshi, Sunil K","Wanga, Shaynah","Cowley, Patrick M","Walker, Joy P","Song, Sang Heon","Mahimkar, Rajeev","Baker, Anthony J","Raffai, Robert L","Wang, Zhen J.","Lovett, David H"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajprenal.00461.2016","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T12:59:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1931-857X","1522-1466"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Renal Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1490360285,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28331061?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28331061","pubdate":"2017-03-24T22:10:04+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nephrology","physiology"],"title":"An Intracellular Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 Isoform Induces Tubular Regulated Necrosis: Implications for Acute Kidney Injury","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intracellular-matrix-metalloproteinase2-isoform-induces-tubular-regulated-necrosis-implications-acut"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248175,"mean":13.335053655902,"rank":205740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248175,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1179,"mean":2.3350967741935,"rank":937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1179,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":2.7839,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/statuses\/845258415723069440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18066608],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T12:58:05+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
