Favorable outcome is strongly associated with the successful reperfusion status. New techniques for MT such as contact aspiration (CA) seem promising to increase reperfusion status and clinical outcome in retrospective studies. We aim at ascertaining whether CA is more efficient than stent retriever as a front-line endovascular procedure.\nThe ASTER trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, controlled, open-label with blinded outcome evaluation (PROBE) design. Patients admitted with suspected ischemic anterior circulation stroke secondary to LVO, with onset of symptoms <6hours, were randomized 1:1 to CA or SR; stratified by center and prior IV thrombolysis. If the assigned treatment technique was not successful after three attempts, the procedure was continued with another technique at the operator's discretion. The primary outcome will be the successful recanalization (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [mTICI] score 2b-3) at the end of the treatment. Secondary outcome will include the successful recanalization after the assigned treatment technique, procedural times, the need for a rescue technique, complications and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3-month. With a two-sided test (alpha=5%, power=90%), an anticipate rate of spontaneous recanalization and catheterization failures of 15%, the sample size estimate will be 380 patients to detect an absolute difference of 15% in primary outcome (assuming a rate of 70% in the control arm).\nPatient enrollment has been completed within 12 months between October 2015 and October 2016. Data analysis is ongoing and final results will be presented at the SFNR meeting.
