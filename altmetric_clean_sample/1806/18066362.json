Human umbilical cord blood derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) administered via the jugular vein have been previously shown to improve PAH by reversal treatment. However, the effect of low dosage and transfusion timing of hUCB-MSCs on PAH has not yet been clearly established. Obviously, low dosage treatment can lead to a reduction in costs. This is the first study on early transfusion effect.\nThis study was divided into two parts. The first part is an investigation of dose-dependent effect. hUCB-MSCs were administered into 3 groups of rats (UA: 3\u00d710\u2076 cells, UB: 1.5\u00d710\u2076 cells, UC: 3\u00d710\u2075 cells) via the external jugular vein at week 1 after monocrotaline (MCT) injection. The second part is a search for optimal treatment timing in 3\u00d710\u2075 cells dose of hUCB-MSCs administered at day 1 for UD group (low dose of hUCB-MSCs at day 1), at day 1 and week 1 for the UE group (dual transfusion of low dose of hUCB-MSCs at day 1 and week 1) and at 1 week for the UF group (reversal treatment of low dose hUCB-MSC at week 1) after MCT injection.\nThe administration of 3\u00d710\u2075 hUCB-MSCs was as effective as the 3\u00d710\u2076 dose in decreasing mean right ventricle (RV) pressure and pulmonary pathological changes. Early treatment with hUCB-MSCs improved mean RV pressure, pulmonary pathological changes and heart collagen 3 protein expression levels in PAH.\nLow-dose early treatment of hUCB-MSCs is as effective as a high dose treatment of hUCB-MSCs in improving PAH although dual or reversal treatment is still more effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a25","authors":["Lee, Hyeryon","Kim, Kwan Chang","Choi, Soo Jin","Hong, Young Mi"],"doi":"10.3349\/ymj.2017.58.3.570","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T12:50:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0513-5796","1976-2437"],"issue":"3","journal":"Yonsei Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1490359835,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28332363?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28332363","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Yonsei University College of Medicine (KAMJE)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Optimal Dose and Timing of Umbilical Stem Cells Treatment in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertensive Rats","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimal-dose-timing-umbilical-stem-cells-treatment-pulmonary-arterial-hypertensive-rats-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248176,"mean":13.335006773446,"rank":205739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248176,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":2.051453100159,"rank":488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":4.8642857142857,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/statuses\/845256528374333440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18066362],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T12:50:35+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":455},"tweet_id":"845256528374333440"}]}}
