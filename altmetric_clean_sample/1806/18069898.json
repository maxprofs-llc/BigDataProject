Resting and total energy expenditure (REE, TEE) were assessed by indirect calorimetry and doubly-labeled water (DLW), respectively; physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) was calculated as TEE-0.1TEE-REE. Fat mass (FM), FFM, and bone mineral were evaluated with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; changed body energy stores were calculated as 1.0([INCREMENT]FFM\/[INCREMENT]time)+9.5([INCREMENT]FM\/[INCREMENT]time). Total-body water (TBW), and its compartments were assessed through dilution techniques and total-body protein (TBPro) was calculated from a four-compartment model, with body volume assessed by air displacement plethysmography.\nThough a negative EB of -17.4\u00b172.7 kcal\/d was observed (p<0.05), EB varied widely among sports and across sex groups resulting in a net weight increase (0.7\u00b12.3 kg) that is attributable to significant changes in FFM (1.2\u00b11.6 kg) and FM (-0.7\u00b11.5 kg) (p<0.05). EB was related with TBW, and intracellular water (r=0.354, r=0.257, p<0.05, respectively), regardless of sex, sports, and age.\nThe mean negative EB observed over the season resulted from the rate of FM utilization and FFM accretion, but with a large variation by sex and sports. TBW, but not TBPro or mineral balance, explained the magnitude of EB which means that athletes under a positive or a negative EB showed a TBW expansion or shrinkage, respectively, specifically within the cells, over one athletic season.","authors":["Silva, Analiza M","Matias, Catarina N","Santos, Diana A","Thomas, Diana","Bosy-Westphal, Anja","M\u00fcller, Manfred J.","Heymsfield, Steven B","Sardinha, Lu\u00eds B","SILVA, ANALIZA M.","MATIAS, CATARINA N.","SANTOS, DIANA A.","THOMAS, DIANA","BOSY-WESTPHAL, ANJA","M\u00dcLLER, MANFRED J.","HEYMSFIELD, STEVEN B.","SARDINHA, LU\u00cdS B."],"doi":"10.1249\/mss.0000000000001280","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T14:53:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0195-9131","1530-0315"],"issue":"8","journal":"Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise","last_mentioned_on":1500759990,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Energy_Balance_over_One_Athletic_Season_.97244.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Energy_Balance_over_One_Athletic_Season_.97244.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Abstract\/2017\/08000\/Energy_Balance_over_One_Athletic_Season.26.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/9000\/00000\/Energy_Balance_over_One_Athletic_Season_.97244.pdf","pmid":"28514233","pubdate":"2017-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","startpage":"1724","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Energy Balance over One Athletic Season","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/acsm-msse\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Energy_Balance_over_One_Athletic_Season_.97244.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/energy-balance-one-athletic-season"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Sports and Recreations":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1,"BR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GeraldByrne1\/statuses\/845286341554393088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18069898],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T14:49:03+00:00","author":{"name":"GBNutracise","url":"https:\/\/www.GBnutracise.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/872838676790861824\/adureZLi_normal.jpg","description":"Nutrition & Exercise Science Consultancy, PhD Candidate Physiology - Metabolic Biochemistry, MSc Food Science, BA (Hons) Exercise and Health,","id_on_source":"GeraldByrne1","tweeter_id":"2148866791","geo":{"lt":53,"ln":-8,"country":"IE"},"followers":188},"tweet_id":"845286341554393088"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RodrigoZacca\/statuses\/845345798179246080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18069898],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T18:45:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Zacca, Rodrigo","url":"http:\/\/lattes.cnpq.br\/9409696644333101","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896036505411612672\/REk73CEd_normal.jpg","description":"#Swimming #OpenWater #TrackAndField #Triathlon #Soccer #PerformanceAnalysis #Coach #Research @ufrgsnoticias\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 @gpea_ufrgs\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 @UPorto @LABIOMEP \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf9","id_on_source":"RodrigoZacca","tweeter_id":"62605370","geo":{"lt":-10,"ln":-55,"country":"BR"},"followers":1160},"tweet_id":"845345798179246080"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Docorange1\/statuses\/845628534836150272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18069898],"posted_on":"2017-03-25T13:28:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Bruce Williams","url":"http:\/\/www.breakthroughsportsperformance.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3557040767\/63eb3a0d70fd7dd4aa2677c89117c235_normal.jpeg","description":"DPM, Breakthrough Sports Performance, Weil Foot & Ankle Institute.
