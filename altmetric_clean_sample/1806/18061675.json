The combination of these 2 agents has several advantages, including a low risk of hypoglycemia, the potential for weight loss, the ability to co-formulate into a pill with once-daily administration, and the possibility to use with other classes of glucose-lowering agents. Cardiovascular outcomes trials reported to date support the safety of the DPP-4 class and suggest possible cardioprotective effects for SGLT2 inhibitors - at least based on the first reported study, which used empagliflozin. Recently, clinical evidence shows that SGLT2 inhibitor\/DPP-4 inhibitor therapy is an effective combination for T2DM treatment, providing glycated hemoglobin reductions (HbA1c) of 1.1% to 1.5%, and weight reductions of approximately 2 kg when added to metformin, which is its primary place in therapy.\nThe combination of an SGLT2 inhibitor\/DPP-4 inhibitor is a safe and effective treatment choice for patients with T2DM who are unable to obtain adequate glycemic control with metformin therapy, who cannot use metformin, or who have a higher baseline HbA1c.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f61000727c","authors":["Lingvay, Ildiko"],"doi":"10.4158\/ep161725.ra","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T10:09:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-891X","1934-2403"],"journal":"Endocrine Practice","last_mentioned_on":1490350176,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28332871?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28332871","pubdate":"2017-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AACE Corp (American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"SODIUM GLUCOSE COTRANSPORTER 2 AND DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-4 INHIBITION: PROMISE OF A DYNAMIC DUO","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-dipeptidyl-peptidase4-inhibition-promise-dynamic-duo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248175,"mean":13.335057685333,"rank":205716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248175,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":450,"mean":7.3352160356347,"rank":362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":450,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":17.53,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ieiDM2\/statuses\/845216019140362242","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18061675],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T10:09:36+00:00","author":{"name":"IeI Diabetes","url":"http:\/\/acmi.org.co","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793691475020308481\/OeUSIgeX_normal.jpg","description":"Investigaci\u00f3n, emprendimiento e innovaci\u00f3n en diabetes mellitus tipo 2","id_on_source":"ieiDM2","tweeter_id":"793687529090347008","geo":{"lt":6.25184,"ln":-75.56359,"country":"CO"},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"845216019140362242"}]}}
