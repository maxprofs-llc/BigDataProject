The goal of this study was to analyze the risk of depression in patients diagnosed with RA and treated by general practitioners in the UK.\nThe present study included patients first diagnosed with RA between 2000 and 2014 (index date). Individuals were excluded if they had also been diagnosed with depression or if they had received therapy for depression at or prior to the index date. The primary outcome measure was the rate of patients with depression (ICD 10: F32, 33) within 5\u00a0years of the RA diagnosis. Demographic data included gender and age. Furthermore, a revised version of the Charlson comorbidity index was used as a generic marker of comorbidity.\nA total of 4187 patients were included in the study. After 5\u00a0years of follow-up, 23.7% of men and 36.5% of women had developed depression (log rank p value <0.001). Women were more likely to develop depression than men (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.84). Age and Charlson comorbidity score had no significant impact on the risk of being diagnosed with this psychiatric disorder.\nAround 30% of RA patients developed depression within 5\u00a0years of the RA diagnosis. The depression risk was higher in women than in men. The current findings also indicate that improved detection and treatment of patients with both RA and depression are important.","altmetric_jid":"54e78aa82a83ee4e3d8b4575","authors":["Louis Jacob","Timo Rockel","Karel Kostev"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40744-017-0058-2","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T13:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2198-6576","2198-6584"],"journal":"Rheumatology and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1492549301,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs40744-017-0058-2?utm_content=buffere84f5&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/rd.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs40744-017-0058-2#Sec8"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40744-017-0058-2.pdf","pmid":"28321833","pubdate":"2017-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Depression Risk in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the United Kingdom","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s40744-017-0058-2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-risk-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-united-kingdom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":9.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":865292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7205646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236052,"mean":13.312515981715,"rank":40880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":194698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236052,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.2422413793103,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":3.3888888888889,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
