T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) are well-recognized negative co-stimulatory molecules involved in viral persistence and tumor metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that CD8(+) T cells co-expressing Tim-3 and PD-1 were down-regulated in the deciduae of female mice in abortion-prone matings compared with normal pregnant mice. In addition to their reduced numbers, the Tim-3(+)PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells produced lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, as well as a higher level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, relative to those from normal pregnancy. Furthermore, normal pregnant CBA\/J females challenged with Tim-3- and\/or PD-1-blocking antibodies were more susceptible to fetal resorption. These findings indicate that Tim-3 and PD-1 pathways play critical roles in regulating CD8(+) T cell function and maintaining normal pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e2e","authors":["XU, Yuan-Yuan","WANG, Song-Cun","LIN, Yi-Kong","LI, Da-Jin","DU, Mei-Rong"],"doi":"10.1262\/jrd.2016-177","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T14:09:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0916-8818","1348-4400"],"journal":"Journal of Reproduction and Development","last_mentioned_on":1490443417,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28331165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28331165","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Japanese Society of Animal Reproduction","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Tim-3 and PD-1 regulate CD8<sup>+<\/sup> T cell function to maintain early pregnancy in mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tim3-pd1-regulate-cd8-t-cell-function-maintain-early-pregnancy-mice-1-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":6385412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248313,"mean":13.33480856342,"rank":178658,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248313,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":1.3568902439024,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":3.85,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
