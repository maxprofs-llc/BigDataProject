The purpose of this study was to explore the risk and possible predictors of developing significant depressive symptoms in children recovering from concussion.\nA prospective cohort study was conducted in a paediatric tertiary care clinic. Depression data were collected from 92 children using the Children's Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) screening tool. Correlations, t-tests and logistic regression were used to examine the associations between depression scores and demographic as well as injury-related factors.\nDepressive symptoms were found in 22% of the children (T score on CDI-2 >65). Children with evidence of depressive symptomatology had significantly higher mean post-concussive symptom inventory (PCSI) scores in recovery (p = 0.004) than children who were not depressed. Variables of i) Sex; ii) hospital admission; iii) number of head injuries; iv) post-concussion symptom score and v) experience of prolonged symptoms were predictive of clinically significant CDI T scores, explaining 36% of the variation in the binary logistic model.\nDepression is commonly reported in this subset of children. High post-concussive symptom scores and hospital admission were strong predictors of depression. Screening for depression should be standard practice in concussion management in children and youth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51f3cf058f6100039eb","authors":["Kathy Stazyk","Carol DeMatteo","Sandra Moll","Cheryl Missiuna"],"doi":"10.1080\/02699052.2017.1283533","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T13:02:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0269-9052","1362-301X"],"journal":"Brain Injury","last_mentioned_on":1506034485,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/02699052.2017.1283533","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28326857\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28326857\/?linkId=36018523","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28326857"],"pmid":"28326857","pubdate":"2017-03-24T22:21:26+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Depression in youth recovering from concussion: Correlates and predictors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-youth-recovering-concussion-correlates-predictors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.05,"score_history":{"1y":5.05,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":1661892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6778394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249309,"mean":13.341475620517,"rank":68280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":180675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249309,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1033,"mean":4.0808236434109,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1033,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":7.3785714285714,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1,"US":3},"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/davidwlawrence1\/statuses\/845259558671015936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18066722],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T13:02:37+00:00","author":{"name":"David W.
