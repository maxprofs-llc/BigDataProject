In our previous studies, a novel tumor therapeutic modality of the cryo-thermal therapy has been presented, highlighting its effect on the suppression of distal metastasis and leading to long-term survival in 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma model. To demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy in other aggressive tumor models and further investigate the mechanism of long-term survival induced, in this study, spontaneous metastatic murine B16F10 melanoma model was used. The cryo-thermal therapy induced regression of implanted melanoma and prolonged long-term survival while inhibiting lung metastasis. It also promoted the activation of CD4(+) CD25(-) conventional T cells, while reduced the percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the spleen, lung and blood. Furthermore, the cryo-thermal therapy enhanced the cytolytic function of CD8(+) T cells and induced differentiation of CD8(+) T cells into memory stem T cell (TSCM), and differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into dominant CD4-CTL, Th1 and Tfh subsets in the spleen for 90 days after the treatment. It was found that good therapeutic effect was mainly dependent on CD4(+) T cells providing a durable memory antitumor immune response. At the same time, significant increase of serum IFN-\u03b3 was also observed to provide an ideal microenvironment of antitumor immunity. Further study showed that the rejection of re-challenge of B16F10 but not GL261 tumor in the treated mice in 45 or 60 days after the treatment, implied a strong systemic and melanoma-specific memory antitumor immunity induced by the treatment. Thus the cryo-thermal therapy would be considered as a new therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis with potential clinical applications in the near future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e18","authors":["He, Kun","Liu, Ping","Xu, Lisa X"],"doi":"10.1038\/cddis.2017.125","first_seen_on":"2017-03-24T10:17:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-4889"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cell Death & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1490350624,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28333145?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28333145","pubdate":"2017-03-24T22:05:03+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","subjects":["cellbiology","internalmedicine"],"title":"The cryo-thermal therapy eradicated melanoma in mice by eliciting CD4+ T-cell-mediated antitumor memory immune response","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cryothermal-therapy-eradicated-melanoma-mice-eliciting-cd4-tcellmediated-antitumor-memory-immune-res"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":6381730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248175,"mean":13.335056677976,"rank":178576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248175,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1574,"mean":5.4899160839161,"rank":1193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1574,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":4.0923,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
