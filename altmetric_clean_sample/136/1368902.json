Two of these 52 tumours were adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland located on the dorsal region forming around the chip. All the other 50 were mesenchymal in origin and were difficult to classify on morphological grounds with haematoxylin-eosin. These sarcomas were investigated using a panel of immunohistochemistry and special stains consisting of desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), myogenin, S100, mouse macrophages, phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin (PTAH) and Masson's trichrome (MT). All the sarcomas displayed the same histochemical characteristics and a close immunophenotype, characterized by desmin +\/-, SMA+, myogenin--, S100--, mouse macrophages + and PTAH-. These tumours thus appear to have similar histologic-type lineage and designation as sarcomas not otherwise specified (NOS) with a large myofibroblastic component appears today to be more appropriate and it is likely to clarify them in the future with the emergence of new markers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000654e","authors":["Le Calvez S","Perron-Lepage MF","Burnett R"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.etp.2005.10.007","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T03:28:07+00:00","issns":["0940-2993","09402993"],"issue":"4","journal":"Experimental & Toxicologic Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1195780200,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B7GJ4-4J2W0D2-1&_user=10&_coverDate=03%2F06%2F2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=a692e12d3690932588fe505a22a83fc5"],"pmid":"16427258","pubdate":"2006-01-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Subcutaneous microchip-associated tumours in B6C3F1 mice: A retrospective study to attempt to determine their histogenesis ","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subcutaneous-microchipassociated-tumours-b6c3f1-mice-retrospective-study-attempt-determine-histogene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.48,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.48},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9072834051191,"rank":548644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3135613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85541,"mean":6.4277177694646,"rank":14997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":70544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85541,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":1.8581379310345,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.425,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
