Given the uncertainty about their role, we sought to evaluate the geographic variation in the use of epidural steroid injections for low back pain within the United States. We also sought to determine whether greater rates of epidural steroid injections are associated with lower rates of lumbar surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd4","authors":["Janna Friedly","Leighton Chan","Richard Deyo"],"doi":"10.2106\/jbjs.g.00858","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T08:00:02+00:00","issns":["0021-9355"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery, American Volume","last_mentioned_on":1453374516,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2657306\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2657306","pmid":"18676905","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1730","subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Geographic Variation in Epidural Steroid Injection Use in Medicare Patients","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/geographic-variation-epidural-steroid-injection-medicare-patients-10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":4984885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1768090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114552,"mean":6.5212810713133,"rank":68106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":40841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114552,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2074,"mean":7.1793709599614,"rank":1637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2074,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.7414193548387,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
