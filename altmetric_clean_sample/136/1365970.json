Several important results were recently reported using mammals as model organisms, including (i) the absence of relationship between mitochondrial DNA diversity and life-history or ecological variables, (ii) the absence of prominent adaptive selection, contrary to what was found in invertebrates, and (iii) the unexpectedly large variation in neutral substitution rate among lineages, revealing a possible link with species maximal longevity. We propose to challenge these results thanks to the bird\/mammal comparison. Direct estimates of population size are available in birds, and this group presents striking life-history trait differences with mammals (higher mass-specific metabolic rate and longevity). These properties make birds the ideal model to directly test for population size effects, and to discriminate between competing hypotheses about the causes of substitution rate variation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Benoit Nabholz","Sylvain Gl\u00e9min","Nicolas Galtier"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-9-54","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T00:44:43+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1489028037,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-54","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/9\/54","http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-54"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-54?site=bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"19284537","pubdate":"2009-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/ Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"54","subjects":["biology"],"title":"The erratic mitochondrial clock: variations of mutation rate, not population size, affect mtDNA diversity across birds and mammals","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2148-9-54","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erratic-mitochondrial-clock-variations-mutation-rate-not-population-size-affect-mtdna-diversity-acro-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.852,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.852},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":1020578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7310574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120150,"mean":6.8280951485241,"rank":15600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":104550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120150,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2009,"mean":9.25528187251,"rank":445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2009,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":5.8879069767442,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":19,"Researcher":78,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
