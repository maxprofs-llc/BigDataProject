Due to the side effect profile of pegylated interferons, interferon-sparing regimens have become the main target in chronic hepatitis C treatment research. Recent proofs of concept studies have suggested that cure of chronic hepatitis C can be achieved without interferon. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the clinical results recently reported for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection with interferon-free regimens, focusing on the most promising new compounds and combinations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["Gonz&#xe1;lez-Moreno, J."],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/825375","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T11:22:47+00:00","issns":[""],"journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1372080657,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2013\/825375\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2013\/825375"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/tswj\/2013\/825375.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3654259","pmid":"23710151","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Hepatitis C Virus Infection: Looking for Interferon Free Regimens","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-c-virus-infection-looking-interferon-free-regimens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":2745500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":724998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":19},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85499,"mean":6.5335940957684,"rank":60904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":19384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85499,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1126,"mean":1.8286613333333,"rank":669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1126,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.0732727272727,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
