Here we review the various levels of interdependence between transcription and replication processes and how different types of encounters between RNA- and DNA-polymerase complexes may result in clashes of those machineries on the DNA template and thus increase genomic instability. In addition, we summarize strategies evolved in bacteria and eukaryotes to minimize the consequences of collisions, including R-loop formation and topological stresses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Anne Helmrich","Monica Ballarino","Evgeny Nudler","Laszlo Tora"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.2543","endpage":"418","first_seen_on":"2013-04-11T11:56:25+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1365505293,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v20\/n4\/pdf\/nsmb.2543.pdf"],"pmid":"23552296","pubdate":"2013-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"412","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Transcription-replication encounters, consequences and genomic instability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptionreplication-encounters-consequences-genomic-instability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2087367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2383744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89421,"mean":6.7780987922166,"rank":38969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":49476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89421,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":5.8635180870631,"rank":965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":5.2502413793103,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
