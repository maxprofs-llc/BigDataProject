This isolate, identified as Leucosporidium sp. based on an analysis of the D1\/D2 and ITS regions of its ribosomal DNA, produced a secretory ice-binding protein (IBP). Yeast IBP was purified from the culture medium to near homogeneity by the ice affinity method and appeared to be glycosylated with a molecular mass of approximately 26 kDa. In addition, the yeast IBP was shown to have thermal hysteresis (TH) and recrystallization inhibition (RI) activities. The full-length cDNA for yeast IBP was determined and was found to encode a 261 amino acid protein with molecular weight of 26.8 kDa that includes an N-terminal signal peptide and one potential N-glycosylation site. The deduced protein showed high sequence identity with other IBPs and hypothetical IBPs from fungi, diatoms, and bacteria, clustering with a class of ice-active proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000264e","authors":["Lee JK","Park KS","Park S","Park H","Song YH","Kang SH","Kim HJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cryobiol.2010.01.002","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T04:13:54+00:00","issns":["0011-2240"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cryobiology","last_mentioned_on":1275318000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20067781"],"pmid":"20067781","pubdate":"2010-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"An extracellular ice-binding glycoprotein from an Arctic psychrophilic yeast.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracellular-icebinding-glycoprotein-arctic-psychrophilic-yeast"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.488,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.488},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":856267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4179455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93395,"mean":6.9020305158791,"rank":17314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":76069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93395,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180,"mean":7.7595977653631,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.7833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
