Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1,589) and controlling for economic conditions in middle childhood and adolescence, as well as demographic conditions at the time of the birth, findings indicate statistically significant and, in some cases, quantitatively large detrimental effects of early poverty on a number of attainment-related outcomes (adult earnings and work hours). Early-childhood poverty was not associated with such behavioral measures as out-of-wedlock childbearing and arrests. Most of the adult earnings effects appear to operate through early poverty's association with adult work hours.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Duncan, Greg J.","Ziol\u2010Guest, Kathleen M.","Kalil, Ariel"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1467-8624.2009.01396.x","endpage":"325","first_seen_on":"2013-04-12T03:33:28+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1467-8624","0009-3920","14678624"],"issue":"1","journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1388534400,"links":["http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/cgi-bin\/fulltext\/123275016\/PDFSTART","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1467-8624.2009.01396.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8624.2009.01396.x\/pdf","pmid":"20331669","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"306","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Early\u00e2\u0080\u0090Childhood Poverty and Adult Attainment, Behavior, and Health","type":"article","volume":"81","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/earlychildhood-poverty-adult-attainment-behavior-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.488,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.488},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6915232,"mean":6.2103982490224,"rank":564561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6351114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6915232,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114019,"mean":6.4549225560877,"rank":10655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":103363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114019,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2005,"mean":11.418872255489,"rank":351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":1654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2005,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":13.866666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":40,"Student  > Doctoral Student":34,"Student  > Ph.
