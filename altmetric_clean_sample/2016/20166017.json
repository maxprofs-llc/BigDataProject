However, how these functions are regulated by Hik33 remains to be addressed. Using a hik33-deficient strain (\u0394hik33) of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) and quantitative proteomics, we found that Hik33 depletion induces differential protein expression highly similar to that induced by divergent types of stresses. This typically includes downregulation of proteins in photosynthesis and carbon assimilation that are necessary for cell propagation, and upregulation of heat shock proteins, chaperons, and proteases that are important for cell survival. This observation indicates that depletion of Hik33 alone mimics divergent types of abiotic stresses, and that Hik33 could be important for preventing abnormal stress response in the normal condition. Moreover, we found the majority of proteins of plasmid origin were significantly upregulated in \u0394hik33, though their biological significance remains to be addressed. Together, the systematically characterized Hik33-regulated cyanobacterial proteome, which is largely involved in stress responses, builds the molecular basis for Hik33 as a general regulator of stress responses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081d9","authors":["Haitao Ge","Longfa Fang","Xiahe Huang","Jinlong Wang","Weiyang Chen","Ye Liu","Yuanya Zhang","Xiaorong Wang","Wu Xu","Qingfang
