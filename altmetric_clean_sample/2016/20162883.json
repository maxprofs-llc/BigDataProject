An additional control group of SAM resistant 1 mice was included (SAMR1 group, n=12). Morris water maze tests were used to investigate learning and memory abilities. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to study expression of G protein subunits and their activities in the cortex\/hippocampus.\nBehavioural analysis showed that acupuncture attenuated the severe cognitive deficits observed in untreated\/CA-treated SAMP8 mice. The findings of the G protein activation assays via immunoprecipitation and Western blots were that the physiologically coupled activation rate (PCAR) and maximal coupled activation rate (MCAR) of G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i were decreased in the cortex of SAMP8 vs SAMR1 mice. Sanjiao acupuncture induced an upregulation in the PCAR of G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i. In the hippocampus of untreated SAMP8 mice, the PCAR of G\u03b1s and MCAR of both G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i declined, and Sanjiao acupuncture was associated with an upregulation in the MCAR of G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i. There were no significant differences in G\u03b1s and G\u03b1i expression between the groups.\nSanjiao acupuncture attenuates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD via upregulation of G protein activity and stabilisation of the cellular signal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa57a3cf058f610004da8","authors":["Benhua Luo","Lan Zhao","Xuezhu Zhang","Bohong Kan","Yunhe Liu","Yujie Jia","Jingxian Han","Jianchun Yu"],"doi":"10.1136\/acupmed-2016-011139","first_seen_on":"2017-05-15T11:12:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0964-5284","1759-9873"],"journal":"Acupuncture in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1494439028,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28450287"],"pmid":"28450287","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Acupuncture upregulates G protein coupled activity in SAMP8 mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acupuncture-upregulates-g-protein-coupled-activity-samp8-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183187,"mean":6.9217013823156,"rank":7081530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183187,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237091,"mean":12.361180404066,"rank":192638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237091,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":681,"mean":10.5874,"rank":646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":681,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":7.6375,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Evidence Based Acupuncture","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=2269216113304030&id=1698788733680107","license":"public","citation_ids":[20162883],"posted_on":"2017-05-10T17:57:08+00:00","summary":"\"Sanjiao acupuncture attenuates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of [Alzheimer's Disease] via upregulation of G protein activity and stabilisation of the cellular signal.\"","author":{"name":"Romila S.
