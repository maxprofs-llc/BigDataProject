The PLGA\/MPLA NPs carriers were incubated with macrophages to examine their effects on survival and function. PLGA\/MPLA NPs, with and without Map antigens, are efficiently phagocytized by macrophages with no evidence of toxicity. PLGA\/MPLA NP formulations did not alter the level of expression of MHC I or II molecules. Expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL12p40 was increased in Map loaded NPs. T cell proliferation studies using a model peptide from Anaplasma marginale demonstrated that a CD4 T cell recall response could be elicited with macrophages pulsed with the peptide encapsulated in the PLGA\/MPLA NP.\nThese findings indicate PLGA\/MPLA NPs can be used as a vehicle for delivery and testing of candidate peptide based vaccines.
