Compared to traditional optical-based sensing, electrochemical biosensors are attractive due to superior performance in response time, cost, complexity and potential for miniaturization. To address the shortcomings of traditional benchtop electrochemical instruments, in recent years, many complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) instrumentation circuits have been reported for electrochemical biosensors. This paper provides a review and analysis of CMOS electrochemical instrumentation circuits. First, important concepts in electrochemical sensing are presented from an instrumentation point of view. Then, electrochemical instrumentation circuits are organized into functional classes, and reported CMOS circuits are reviewed and analyzed to illuminate design options and performance tradeoffs. Finally, recent trends and challenges toward on-CMOS sensor integration that could enable highly miniaturized electrochemical biosensor microsystems are discussed. The information in the paper can guide next generation electrochemical sensor design.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Haitao Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17010074","first_seen_on":"2016-12-31T09:42:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"1","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1485862166,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/1\/74?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/1\/74","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/1\/74?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/1\/74\/pdf","pmid":"28042860","pubdate":"2016-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"74","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"CMOS Electrochemical Instrumentation for Biosensor Microsystems: A Review","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cmos-electrochemical-instrumentation-biosensor-microsystems-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":3.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":1959417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6177355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262544,"mean":12.460838392187,"rank":86060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":175365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262544,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":1.9365426865672,"rank":306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":1.9017142857143,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
