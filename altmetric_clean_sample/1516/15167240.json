However, the use of tPA has been profoundly constrained due to its narrow therapeutic time window and the increased risk of potentially deadly hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Blood brain barrier (BBB) damage within the thrombolytic time window is an indicator for tPA-induced HT and both normobaric hyperoxia (NBO) and hypothermia have been shown to protect the BBB from ischemia\/reperfusion injury. Therefore, providing the O2 as soon as possible (NBO treatment), freezing the brain (hypothermia treatment) to slow down ischemia-induced BBB damage or their combined use may extend the time window for the treatment of tPA. In this review, we summarize the protective effects of NBO, hypothermia or their use combined with tPA on ischemia stroke, based on which, the combination of NBO and hypothermia may be an ideal early stroke treatment to preserve the ischemic penumbra. Given this, there is an urge for large randomized controlled trials to address the effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086c","authors":["Liu","Wen-cao Liu","Xin-chun Jin"],"doi":"10.4103\/2045-9912.196902","first_seen_on":"2016-12-31T10:17:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-9912"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Gas Research","last_mentioned_on":1483179478,"links":["http:\/\/www.medgasres.com\/article.asp?issn=2045-9912;year=2016;volume=6;issue=4;spage=206;epage=211;aulast=Liu#.WGeFu7w3bRU.linkedin","http:\/\/www.medgasres.com\/article.asp?issn=2045-9912%3Byear%3D2016%3Bvolume%3D6%3Bissue%3D4%3Bspage%3D206%3Bepage%3D211%3Baulast%3DLiu#.WGeFyVYk7x4.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.medgasres.com\/article.asp?issn=2045-9912;year=2016;volume=6;issue=4;spage=206;epage=211;aulast=Liu;type=2","pmid":"28217292","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","title":"Oxygen or cooling, to make a decision after acute ischemia stroke","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxygen-cooling-make-decision-after-acute-ischemia-stroke"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":6893059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253436,"mean":12.491060642768,"rank":208694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253436,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":6.7828380952381,"rank":91,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/815139862290530304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15167240],"posted_on":"2016-12-31T10:17:42+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
