Prolonged gynecological laparoscopic surgeries require prolonged pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position, which can influence respiratory dynamics and other measurements of pulmonary function. We investigated the differences between volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and tried to determine the more efficient ventilation mode during prolonged pneumoperitoneum in gynecological laparoscopy.\nTwenty-six patients scheduled for laparoscopic radical hysterectomy combined with or without laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy were randomly allocated to be ventilated by either VCV or PCV. Standard anesthesic management and laparoscopic procedures were performed. Measurements of respiratory and hemodynamic dynamics were obtained after induction of anesthesia, at 10, 30, 60, and 120\u00a0min after establishing pneumoperitoneum, and at 10\u00a0min after return to supine lithotomy position and removal of carbon dioxide. The logistic regression model was applied to predict the corresponding critical value of duration of pneumoperitoneum when the Ppeak was higher than 40\u00a0cmH2O.\nProlonged pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position produced significant and clinically relevant changes in dynamic compliance and respiratory mechanics in anesthetized patients under PCV and VCV ventilation. Patients under PCV ventilation had a similar increase of dead space\/tidal volume ratio, but had a lower Ppeak increase compared with those under VCV ventilation. The critical value of duration of pneumoperitoneum was predicted to be 355\u00a0min under VCV ventilation, corresponding to the risk of Ppeak higher than 40\u00a0cmH2O.\nBoth VCV and PCV can be safely applied to prolonged gynecological laparoscopic surgery. However, PCV may become the better choice of ventilation after ruling out of other reasons for Ppeak increasing.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Ming Lian","Xiao Zhao","Hong Wang","Lianhua Chen","Shitong Li"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-016-5392-x","first_seen_on":"2016-12-31T04:34:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1483172785,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00464-016-5392-x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00464-016-5392-x.pdf","pmid":"28039643","pubdate":"2016-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Respiratory dynamics and dead space to tidal volume ratio of volume-controlled versus pressure-controlled ventilation during prolonged gynecological laparoscopic surgery","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7965219,"mean":6.7280072798953,"rank":4180959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2223769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7965219,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253434,"mean":12.491154285353,"rank":142397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253434,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3189,"mean":2.6189196988708,"rank":1562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3189,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.5878378378378,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SurgEndosc\/statuses\/815053445032005632","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15163466],"posted_on":"2016-12-31T04:34:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Surgical Endoscopy","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/medicine\/surgery\/journal\/464","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000013288750\/ca66ce36b5667e0eed3bf3c7d2ab6903_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Journal of SAGES and EAES.
