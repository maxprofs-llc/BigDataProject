The underlying molecular mechanisms, in particular the binding mode of the fibrils to cell membranes, are poorly understood. In this work we decipher the modality by which aggregates bind to the cellular membrane, one of the obligatory steps of the propagation cycle. By characterizing the binding properties of aggregates made of \u03b1-synuclein or huntingtin exon 1 protein displaying similar composition and structure but different lengths to mammalian cells we demonstrate that in both cases aggregates bind laterally to the cellular membrane, with aggregates extremities displaying little or no role in membrane binding. Lateral binding to artificial liposomes was also observed by transmission electron microscopy. In addition we show that although \u03b1-synuclein and huntingtin exon 1 fibrils bind both laterally to the cellular membrane, their mechanisms of interaction differ. Our findings have important implications for the development of future therapeutic tools that aim to block protein aggregates propagation in the brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Elodie Monsellier","Luc Bousset","Ronald Melki"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep19180","first_seen_on":"2016-01-17T16:21:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1453477871,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep19180","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26757959?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4725933","pmid":"26757959","pubdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Prions","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Huntington's disease","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Parkinson's disease","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"\u03b1-Synuclein and huntingtin exon 1 amyloid fibrils bind laterally to the cellular membrane.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1synuclein-huntingtin-exon-1-amyloid-fibrils-bind-laterally-cellular-membrane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":3200845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3749009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314384,"mean":9.1534045097856,"rank":145447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":165639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314384,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25290,"mean":14.441372928941,"rank":13362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":11701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25290,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2830,"mean":16.141828914811,"rank":1471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2830,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
