The same standardized investigations were performed in all patients. pSS and sicca not due to pSS diagnoses were based on evaluating physician opinion. Each patient completed three validated questionnaires on QoL (SF-36), fatigue (MFI), depression and anxiety (HADS).\nOf the 95 included patients, 55 (57.9%) had pSS and 40 (42.1%) had sicca without pSS. Gender distribution, age, disease duration, and sicca symptoms were similar in the two groups. The pSS group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with abnormal objective tests for dryness (Schirmer's test and salivary flow rate). The SF-36, HADS, and MFI scores were similarly altered in the two groups. Anxiety was more common than depression in both groups. The most affected domains were vitality in the SF-36 and general\/physical fatigue in the MFI. Extraglandular systemic involvement was not a major determinant of QoL alteration in patients with pSS.\nSicca symptoms are associated with severe alterations in SF-36, HADS, and MFI scores regardless of objective test abnormalities and pSS diagnosis. Anxiety is more common than depression and should be taken into account when managing all patients with sicca symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c46","authors":["Morgane, Milin","Cornec, Divi","Chastaing, Myriam","Griner, Veronique","Berrouiguet, Sofian","Nowak, Emmanuel","Marhadour, Thierry","Saraux, Alain","Devauchelle-Pensec, Val\u00e9rie","Milin, Morgane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbspin.2015.10.005","endpage":"685","first_seen_on":"2016-01-18T15:41:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1778-7254","1297319X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Joint Bone Spine","last_mentioned_on":1484515117,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26774177","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1297319X15003127&_version=1&md5=f6216b83db9e06cb2c6e492c3f9ff46f","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26774177"],"pmid":"26774177","pubdate":"2016-01-18T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"681","subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Sicca symptoms are associated with similar fatigue, anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life impairments in patients with and without primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sicca-symptoms-associated-similar-fatigue-anxiety-depression-qualityoflife-impairments-patients-with"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8071305,"mean":6.8537279477937,"rank":3470623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4486295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8071305,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327803,"mean":9.439530728915,"rank":124503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":197025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327803,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":2.7574464285714,"rank":128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.626,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
