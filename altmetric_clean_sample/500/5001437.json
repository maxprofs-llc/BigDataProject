Aissou, G. Hadziioannou, and co-workers report the directed self-assembly of Si-containing block copolymer thin films on laser-inscribed azobenene-containing layers. These are shown to be useful to produce laterally ordered sub-10 nm features. One potential application for this processing technology is towards next-generation lithography, for instance, highly ordered 2D arrays of out-of-plane cylinders with an areal density of 2.9 teradots inch(-2) are demonstrated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008951","authors":["Rho, Yecheol","Aissou, Karim","Mumtaz, Muhammad","Kwon, Wonsang","P\u00e9castaings, Gilles","Mocuta, Cristian","Stanecu, Stefan","Cloutet, Eric","Brochon, Cyril","Fleury, Guillaume","Hadziioannou, Georges"],"doi":"10.1002\/smll.201570288","first_seen_on":"2016-01-16T11:24:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1613-6829"],"issue":"48","journal":"Small","last_mentioned_on":1452943479,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26768350?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26768350","pubdate":"2016-01-16T22:02:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","nanotechnology"],"title":"Block Copolymers: Laterally Ordered Sub-10 nm Features Obtained From Directed Self-Assembly of Si-Containing Block Copolymer Thin Films (Small 48\/2015).","type":"article","volume":"11"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":5988868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313280,"mean":9.09779320031,"rank":256132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1657,"mean":5.0923586956522,"rank":1335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1657,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":18.1161875,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/assembly_papers\/statuses\/688320957748912128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5001437],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T11:24:39+00:00","author":{"name":"assemblypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439371508528320512\/TDJfUNti_normal.png","description":"Papers on directed and self assembly","id_on_source":"assembly_papers","tweeter_id":"2364079946","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":332},"tweet_id":"688320957748912128"}]}}
