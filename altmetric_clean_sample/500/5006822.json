Studies have not directly compared cryoprecipitate produced following pathogen inactivation (PI) of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) using different systems. The effects of methylene blue (MB) and amotosalen (AS) PI systems on the quality of FFP and cryoprecipitate were investigated in a paired study.\nSeven group A and 7 group O pools of plasma were prepared and split into individual units and rapidly frozen to produce FFP. Units of FFP were thawed and either PI treated with MB or amotosalen, or left untreated (control). Samples of FFP along with the corresponding cryoprecipitate were tested for a range of coagulation factors, thrombin generation (TGT) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM).\nAS-FFP showed a smaller decrease following treatment for most coagulation factors analysed than MB-FFP, except fibrinogen (antigen) and factor VII, partly due to lower volume losses. There was no significant difference between treatment methods for fibrinogen content of cryoprecipitate with treated units meeting current UK specification, or TGT and ROTEM parameters studied.\nMB-cryo contained a significantly higher content of FVIII and lower content of FXIII when compared to AS-cryo, with no difference in fibrinogen activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003711","authors":["Backholer, L.","Wiltshire, M.","Proffitt, S.","Cookson, P.","Cardigan, R."],"doi":"10.1111\/vox.12368","endpage":"361","first_seen_on":"2016-01-18T11:56:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1423-0410"],"issue":"4","journal":"Vox Sanguinis","last_mentioned_on":1453118160,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vox.12368\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vox.12368\/pdf","pmid":"26757252","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"352","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Paired comparison of methylene blue\u2010 and amotosalen\u2010treated plasma and cryoprecipitate","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paired-comparison-methylene-blue-amotosalentreated-plasma-cryoprecipitate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6988129,"mean":6.2455122147134,"rank":3453586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2026481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6988129,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314468,"mean":9.1585152464326,"rank":163020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314468,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":2.448273458445,"rank":236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":5.0893333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NHSBT_RD\/statuses\/689053622806691840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5006822],"posted_on":"2016-01-18T11:56:00+00:00","author":{"name":"NHSBT R&D","url":"http:\/\/www.nhsbt.nhs.uk\/research-and-development","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793832338010546177\/0Ey6jDOR_normal.jpg","description":"NHS Blood and Transplant's research and development programme - innovation focused on improving patient outcomes","id_on_source":"NHSBT_RD","tweeter_id":"2425741798","geo":{"lt":52.16045,"ln":-0.70312,"country":"GB"},"followers":198},"tweet_id":"689053622806691840"}]}}
