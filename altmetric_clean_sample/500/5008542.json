The N(\u03b1) -Fmoc aspartic acid \u03b2-tri-(ethyl\/propyl\/butyl)methyl esters were used in the synthesis of the classic model peptide scorpion toxin II (VKDGYI), and their effectiveness in minimising aspartimide formation during extended piperidine treatments was evaluated. Furthermore, we compared their efficacy against that of the commonly used approach of adding acids to the Fmoc deprotection solution. Finally, we applied our aspartic acid building blocks to the stepwise Fmoc SPPS of teduglutide, a human GLP-2 analogue, whose synthesis is made challenging by extensive aspartimide formation. In all experiments, our approach led to almost complete reduction of aspartimide formation with accompanied suppression of aspartic acid epimerisation.
