As the number of elderly in the Western world continues to rise and HPB-c are associated with age, we wanted to examine changes in incidence, mortality, prevalence and relative survival for these cancers. Materials and methods HBP-c was defined as ICD-10 codes C22 (liver), C23-24 (gall bladder), and C25 (pancreas). Data derived from the NORDCAN database with comparable data on cancer incidence, mortality, prevalence and relative survival in the Nordic countries, where the Danish data were delivered from the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Cause of Death Registry with follow-up for death or emigration until the end of 2013. Results The incidence and mortality rates of cancer of the liver and pancreas increased over time while the rates of cancer of the gall bladder and bile duct decreased. All HBP-c were more frequent in persons over the age of 70 than in younger persons. The relative one- and five-year survival rose in most HPB-c, but mainly occurring in the younger population of 0-69 years with only small to no gains in the 80\u2009+\u2009group. Conclusion As the number of persons aged 80 years or more will increase dramatically in the following years, and our results show a gap in relative survival, it is important to continue to study this population in order to improve management and outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003800","authors":["Bjerregaard, Jon Kroll","Mortensen, Michael Bau","Pfeiffer, Per",", "],"doi":"10.3109\/0284186x.2015.1114675","first_seen_on":"2016-01-16T13:38:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1651-226X"],"issue":"sup1","journal":"Acta Oncologica","last_mentioned_on":1452951498,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26767397?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26767397","pubdate":"2016-01-16T22:03:02+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Trends in cancer of the liver, gall bladder, bile duct, and pancreas in elderly in Denmark, 1980-2012.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trends-cancer-liver-gall-bladder-bile-duct-pancreas-elderly-denmark-19802012"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":5988936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313280,"mean":9.0978503378775,"rank":256155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":461,"mean":2.3725391304348,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":461,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.63636363636364,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/688354593277755392","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5001792],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T13:38:18+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"688354593277755392"}]}}
