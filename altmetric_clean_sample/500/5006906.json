The beneficial effect or non-effectiveness of that molecule were studied hematologically using blood mean platelet count. Results were that U-74389G administration interacted or not with reoxygenation time decreased the platelet count by 6.12% \u2213 3.58% (p = 0.0857) and 12.83% \u2213 5.79% (p = 0.0303) respectively. C o n c l u s i o n s: U-74389G administration interacted or not with reoxygenation time decreases the platelet count within short-term time of 2 hours by different significance levels.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9173cf058f61000d132","authors":["Tsompos, Constantinos","Panoulis, Constantinos","Toutouzas, Konstantinos","Zografos, George","Papalois, Apostolos"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-18T12:22:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0015-5616"],"issue":"1","journal":"Folia medica Cracoviensia","last_mentioned_on":1453119722,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26774629?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26774629","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Antioxidant 21-aminosteroid \"U-74389G\" ameliorates the short-time effect of hypoxia-reoxygenation on the platelet count in rats.","type":"article","volume":"55"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6988129,"mean":6.2455122147134,"rank":5997865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6988129,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314469,"mean":9.1584993194853,"rank":257508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314469,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.89375,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/689060176905682944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5006906],"posted_on":"2016-01-18T12:22:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"689060176905682944"}]}}
