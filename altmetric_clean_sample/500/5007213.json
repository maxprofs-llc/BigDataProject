They possess anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, however they may induce symptoms and health problems in a small percentage of the population. Therefore, a low phenolic acid diet may be of clinical benefit to such individuals. In order to achieve this goal, the concentration of these substances in different food and beverages should be assessed. The present work describes for the first time a new method, based on solid phase microextraction (polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene fiber) coupled to liquid chromatography with UV diode array detection, for the simultaneous determination of salicylic acid, 3-methyl salicylic acid, 4-methyl salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and benzoic acid in selected fruit, vegetables and beverages. All the aspects influencing fiber adsorption (time, temperature, pH, salt addition) and desorption (desorption and injection time, desorption solvent mixture composition) of the analytes have been investigated. An isocratic separation was performed using an acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 2.8; 2mM) mixture (70:30, v\/v) as the mobile phase. The estimated LOD and LOQ values (\u03bcg\/mL) were in the range 0.002-0.028 and 0.007-0.095. The within-day and day-to-day precision values (RSD%) were between 4.7-6.1 and 6.6-9.4, respectively. The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of fava beans, blueberries, kiwi, tangerines, lemons, oranges and fruit juice (lemon and blueberry) samples. The major advantage of the method is that it only requires simple homogenization and\/or centrifugation and dilution steps prior to SPME and injection in the LC system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb7","authors":["Aresta, Antonella","Zambonin, Carlo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpba.2015.12.016","first_seen_on":"2016-01-18T14:03:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-264X"],"journal":"Journal of Pharmaceutical & Biomedical Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1453125806,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26775020?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26775020","pubdate":"2016-01-18T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Simultaneous determination of salicylic, 3-methyl salicylic, 4-methyl salicylic, acetylsalicylic and benzoic acids in fruit, vegetables and derived beverages by SPME-LC-UV\/DAD.","type":"article","volume":"121","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simultaneous-determination-salicylic-3methyl-salicylic-4methyl-salicylic-acetylsalicylic-benzoic-aci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6988129,"mean":6.2455122147134,"rank":5997875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6988129,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314468,"mean":9.1585397323087,"rank":257514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314468,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":707,"mean":1.8346770538244,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":707,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.2695,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":1,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/plant_biology\/statuses\/689085693264527360","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5007213],"posted_on":"2016-01-18T14:03:26+00:00","author":{"name":"plantbio","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"plant_biology","tweeter_id":"3182517054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":107},"tweet_id":"689085693264527360"}]}}
