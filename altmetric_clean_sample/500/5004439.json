The total observational period was at least 2 years and up to 5 years between single visits. Demographic and visual acuity (VA) data also were obtained. In the prospective study, eligible patients were examined at baseline using a standard protocol, with 6-month follow-up visits planned for a 2-year period for serial Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected VA, SD OCT, FAF, and MP.\nDesign and rationale of a multicenter study to determine the progression of STGD1 in 2 large retrospective and prospective international cohorts. Detailed baseline characteristics of both cohorts are presented, including demographics, and structural and functional retinal metrics.\nInto the retrospective study, 251 patients (458 eyes) were enrolled; mean follow-up \u00b1 standard deviation was 3.9\u00b11.6 years. At baseline, 36% had no or mild VA loss, and 47% of the study eyes had areas of definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) with an average lesion area of 2.5\u00b12.9 mm(2) (range, 0.02-16.03 mm(2)). Two hundred fifty-nine patients (489 eyes) were enrolled in the prospective study. At baseline, 20% had no or mild VA loss, and 64% had areas of DDAF with an average lesion area of 4.0\u00b14.4 mm(2) (range, 0.03-24.24 mm(2)). The mean retinal sensitivity with MP was 10.8\u00b15.0 dB.\nThe ProgStar cohorts have baseline characteristics that encompass a wide range of disease severity and are expected to provide valuable data on progression based on serial quantitative measurements derived from multiple methods, which will be critical to the design of planned clinical trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003250","authors":["Strauss, Rupert W","Ho, Alex","Mu\u00f1oz, Beatriz","Cideciyan, Artur V","Sahel, Jos\u00e9-Alain","Sunness, Janet S","Birch, David G","Bernstein, Paul S","Michaelides, Michel","Traboulsi, Elias I","Zrenner, Eberhart","Sadda, SriniVas","Ervin, Ann-Margret","West, Sheila","Scholl, Hendrik P N",", "],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ophtha.2015.12.009","first_seen_on":"2016-01-17T13:45:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0161-6420","1549-4713"],"journal":"Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1453410806,"links":["http:\/\/www.aaojournal.org\/article\/S0161-6420(15)01433-5\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26786511?dopt=Abstract#pubmed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.aaojournal.org\/article\/S0161642015014335\/pdf","pmid":"26786511","pubdate":"2016-01-21T13:51:59+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"The Natural History of the Progression of Atrophy Secondary to Stargardt Disease (ProgStar) Studies: Design and Baseline Characteristics: ProgStar Report No. 1.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-history-progression-atrophy-secondary-stargardt-disease-progstar-studies-design-baseline-cha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7003089,"mean":6.2578197435162,"rank":3196869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3748376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7003089,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314319,"mean":9.1528975496151,"rank":145386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":165631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314319,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2043,"mean":11.368185112635,"rank":996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2043,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":27.2196,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
