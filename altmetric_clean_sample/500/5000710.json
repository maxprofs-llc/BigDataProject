Patients were regarded as unsuitable for percutaneous coronary intervention by the heart team. CABG was performed 4 hours after discontinuation of eptifibatide or placebo infusion. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) defined as death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and the need for rehospitalization due to recurrent ischemia at 12-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included MACCE rate at 1 month, bleeding complications, platelet inhibition efficacy and correlation of platelet activity with MACCE rate.\nCumulative one year MACCE rate was 35% vs. 14% in the control and treated group respectively (P=0.012). Mortality rate at 30 days follow-up was 10% vs. 3% (P=0.021) and was not changed at 12-month follow-up. There was a significant difference between both groups regarding perioperative MI (22% vs. 8%, P=0.03). The rates of stroke, blood loss and blood transfusion were similar in both groups.\nPreoperative use of eptifibatide vs. placebo is linked to significantly reduced 12-month MACCE rate in patients with NSTE-ACS requiring urgent CABG, while it simultaneously seems not to confer a greater risk of postoperative bleeding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bbb","authors":["Wilczynski, Miros\u0142aw","Wybraniec, Maciej T","Milewski, Krzysztof","Sanak, Marek","Wita, Krystian","Buldak, \u0141ukasz","Kondys, Marek","Buszman, Pawe\u0142","Bochenek, Andrzej"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-16T09:00:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0021-9509"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Cardiovascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1452934821,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26771733"],"pmid":"26771733","pubdate":"2016-01-16T22:00:12+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Eptifibatide infusion versus placebo in high risk patients with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes managed with urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
