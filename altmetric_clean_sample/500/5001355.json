Integrative therapies may represent important tools for prevention in this population. This article reviews the cardiotoxicity of conventional breast cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation, and hormonal therapy. Data are presented on the benefits of substances such as curcumin, melatonin, Ginkgo biloba, resveratrol, coenzyme Q10, and l-carnitine. Although clinical studies on many of these substances are limited both in size and number, preclinical studies are available for several, and this article summarizes the potential mechanisms of action. Areas for future research are also identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005991","authors":["Lucius, Khara","Trukova, Kristen"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-16T11:20:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1546-993X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452951845,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26770154?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4712857","pmid":"26770154","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Integrative Therapies and Cardiovascular Disease in the Breast Cancer Population: A Review, Part 1.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integrative-therapies-cardiovascular-disease-breast-cancer-population-review-part-1-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":3022990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3798252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313281,"mean":9.09782209525,"rank":134112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":168916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313281,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":7.9825,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/688319958166540288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5001355],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T11:20:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"688319958166540288"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cgrisan\/statuses\/688356048193753088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5001355],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T13:44:05+00:00","author":{"name":"cgrisan","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"cgrisan","tweeter_id":"2832037486","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5},"tweet_id":"688356048193753088"}]}}
