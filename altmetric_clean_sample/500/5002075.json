We selected two spherical gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based vehicles of optimal size for activator and antigen delivery. Their combination (termed the NanoAu-Cocktail) was associated with the dual targeting of CpG oligonucleotides (CpG-ODNs) and an OVA peptide (OVAp) to DC subcellular compartments, inducing enhanced antigen cross-presentation, upregulated expression of costimulatory molecules and elevated secretion of T helper1 cytokines. We demonstrated that the intravenously transfused NanoAu-Cocktail pulsed DCs showed dramatically improved in vivo homing ability to lymphoid tissues and were settled in T cell area. Especially, by tissue-distribution analysis, we found that more than 60% of lymphoid tissues-homing DCs accumulated in liver-draining lymph nodes (LLNs). The improved homing ability of NanoAu-Cocktail pulsed DCs was associated with the high expression of chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and rearrangement of the cytoskeletons. In addition, by antigen-specific tetramers detection, NanoAu-Cocktail pulsed DCs were proved able to elicit strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which provided enhanced protection from viral invasions. This study highlights the importance of codelivering antigen\/adjuvant using different sized gold nanoparticles to improve DC homing and therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","authors":["Zhou, Qianqian","Zhang, Yulong","Du, Juan","Li, Yuan","Zhou, Yong","Fu, Qiuxia","Zhang, Jingang","Wang, Xiaohui","Zhan, Linsheng"],"doi":"10.1021\/acsnano.5b07716","first_seen_on":"2016-01-16T15:29:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-086X"],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1452958151,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26771692?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26771692","pubdate":"2016-01-16T22:00:14+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Different-Sized Gold Nanoparticle Activator\/Antigen Increases Dendritic Cells Accumulation in Liver-Draining Lymph Nodes and CD8+ T Cell Responses.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differentsized-gold-nanoparticle-activatorantigen-increases-dendritic-cells-accumulation-liverdraini"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":3447164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2024374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313280,"mean":9.0978809814891,"rank":162008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":117253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313280,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4489,"mean":10.712984402852,"rank":2999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4489,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":17.79513592233,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
