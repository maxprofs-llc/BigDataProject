She was unable to sleep due to painful skull metastases and had severe weakness in her extremities that limited her mobility and daily activities. She was treated with 2 doses of Ra-dichloride (Xofigo, Ra) and had a dramatic improvement in pain control, mobility, and overall quality of life for 8 weeks, before passing away from pulmonary hemorrhage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Makis, William","McCann, Karey","McEwan, Alexander J B","Sawyer, Michael B"],"doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0000000000000964","endpage":"147","first_seen_on":"2016-01-17T14:51:07+00:00","issns":["1536-0229","0363-9762"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1471788851,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/Fulltext\/2016\/02000\/Palliation_of_Extensive_Metastatic_Bone_Disease.9.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26359562?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmed\/2016\/02000\/Palliation_of_Extensive_Metastatic_Bone_Disease.9.pdf","pmid":"26359562","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"144","subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Palliation of Extensive Metastatic Bone Disease With 223Ra-Dichloride \u03b1-Particle Therapy in a Patient With Malignant Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma Syndrome With SDHB Mutation","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palliation-extensive-metastatic-bone-disease-223radichloride-%CE%B1particle-therapy-patient-malignant-her"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":6263676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1115220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":329432,"mean":9.4481904010245,"rank":227955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":53655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":329432,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2331,"mean":1.0386077253219,"rank":1197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2331,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.4220720720721,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Palliation of Extensive Metastatic Bone Disease With 223Ra-D... : Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1065436200143728&id=283600854993937","license":"public","citation_ids":[5004542],"posted_on":"2016-01-17T05:47:27+00:00","summary":"Abstract: A 26-year-old woman with a 5-year history of metastatic paraganglioma due to hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome with SDHB mutation, who had failed multiple treatment regimens and had transfusion dependent pancytopenia, presented w","author":{"name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/283600854993937","facebook_wall_name":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/283600854993937\/picture","id_on_source":"283600854993937"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/767364175911714817","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5004542],"posted_on":"2016-08-21T14:14:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24806},"tweet_id":"767364175911714817"}]}}
