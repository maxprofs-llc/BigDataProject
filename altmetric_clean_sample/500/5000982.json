The first step is the ortho-palladation of (Z)-2-aryl-4-aryliden-5(4H)-oxazolones 1 to give dinuclear complexes 2 with bridging carboxylates. The reaction occurs through regioselective activation of the ortho-C\uf8ffH bond of the 4-arylidene ring in carboxylic acids. The second step is the [2+2]-photocycloaddition of the C\uf8feC exocyclic bonds of the oxazolone skeleton in 2 to afford the corresponding dinuclear ortho-palladated cyclobutanes 3. This key step was performed very efficiently by using LED light sources with different wavelengths (465, 525 or 625\u2005nm) in flow microreactors. The final step involved the depalladation of 3 by hydrogenation in methanol to afford the \u03b5-1,3-diaminotruxillic acid derivatives as single isomers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Serrano, Elena","Juan, Alberto","Garc\u00eda\u2010Montero, Angel","Soler, Tatiana","Jim\u00e9nez\u2010M\u00e1rquez, Francisco","Cativiela, Carlos","Gomez, M.
