BCVs directly contact with numerous host compartments, mainly vesicles of the endocytic pathway, such as endosomes or lysosomes. In addition, they also interact with the endoplasmic reticulum and endomembranes of the secretory pathway. These connections between the pathogen and the host occur either through heterotypic membrane fusions or through membrane contact sites. The precise regulation of BCV contacts with host compartments defines the constitution of the intracellular bacterial niche. It emerges that the associated pathways may control the stability of the BCV resulting either in vacuolar or cytoplasmically growing bacteria. Here, we will portray how the usage of novel proteomics and imaging technologies allows comparison of the communication of different host cell compartments with four relevant intracellular human pathogens, namely Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila, Shigella flexneri and Francisella tularensis. The first two remain mainly within the BCV, and the latter two escape into the cytoplasm. This article is protected by copyright.
