As previously reported by Garber and colleagues, a significant prevention effect favored CBP through 9 months; however, outcomes of CBP and UC did not significantly differ when parents were depressed at baseline. The current study expanded on these analyses and examined a range of demographic, clinical, and contextual characteristics of families as predictors and moderators and used recursive partitioning to construct a classification tree to organize clinical response subgroups.\nDepression onset was predicted by lower functioning (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0= 0.95, 95% CI\u00a0= 0.92-0.98) and\u00a0higher hopelessness (HR\u00a0= 1.06, 95%\u00a0CI\u00a0= 1.01-1.11) in\u00a0adolescents. The superior effect of CBP was diminished when parents were currently depressed at baseline (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.38, 95% CI\u00a0= 2.38-17.1) or had a history of hypomania (HR\u00a0= 67.5, 95% CI\u00a0= 10.9-417.1), or\u00a0when adolescents reported higher depressive symptoms\u00a0(HR\u00a0=\u00a01.04, 95%\u00a0CI\u00a0= 1.00-1.08), higher anxiety (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01-1.08), higher hopelessness\u00a0(HR\u00a0=\u00a01.10, 95%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01-1.20), or lower functioning (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95%\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89-1.00) at baseline. Onset rates varied significantly by clinical response cluster (0%-57%).\nDepression in adolescents can be prevented, but programs may produce superior effects when timed at moments of relative wellness in high-risk families. Future programs may be enhanced by targeting modifiable negative clinical indicators of response.\nPrevention of Depression in At-Risk Adolescents; http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/; NCT00073671.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f53","authors":["V.
