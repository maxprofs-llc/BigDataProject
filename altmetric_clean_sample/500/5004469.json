The Fe3O4 cores present spherical shape and have a mean diameter of 300nm, and the Cu-apatite shell with thickness of about 50nm is composed of a large number of sheets. Using the high affinity of Cu(2+) on the surface toward histidine tags, the Fe3O4@Cu-apatite NPs can be applied to enrich and magnetically separate histidine tagged (His-tagged) proteins directly from the mixture of lysed cells. Research results indicated that the Fe3O4@Cu-apatite NPs presented negligible nonspecific protein adsorption and high protein binding ability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dfb","authors":["Li, Ping","Li, Liangliang","Zhao, Yanbao","Sun, Lei","Zhang, Yu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jinorgbio.2015.12.017","first_seen_on":"2016-01-17T14:03:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3344"],"journal":"Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1453039413,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26773852?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26773852","pubdate":"2016-01-17T22:00:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Selective binding and magnetic separation of histidine-tagged proteins using Fe3O4\/Cu-apatite nanoparticles.","type":"article","volume":"156","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-binding-magnetic-separation-histidinetagged-proteins-using-fe3o4cuapatite-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6982524,"mean":6.2409015629427,"rank":5992450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6982524,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313945,"mean":9.1325621766937,"rank":256877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313945,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":365,"mean":5.3149725274725,"rank":270,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":365,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.85344827586207,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/plant_biology\/statuses\/688723335589462016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5004469],"posted_on":"2016-01-17T14:03:33+00:00","author":{"name":"plantbio","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"plant_biology","tweeter_id":"3182517054","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":107},"tweet_id":"688723335589462016"}]}}
