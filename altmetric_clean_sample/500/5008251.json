The meeting, which launched the i(2) = initiating innovation series, was sponsored by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society (TFOS; www.TearFilm.org) and supported by Domp\u00e9. The TFOS i(2) meeting was designed to review advances in the understanding of DED since publication of the 2007 TFOS International Dry Eye WorkShop (DEWS) report, and to help launch the highly anticipated sequel, DEWS II. The meeting was structured to discuss the scope of the DED problem, to review the clinical challenges of DED, and to consider the treatment challenges of DED. This article provides a synopsis of the presentations of this TFOS i(2) meeting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008361","authors":["Chao, Wendy","Belmonte, Carlos","Benitez Del Castillo, Jos\u00e9","Bron, Anthony","Dua, Harminder","Nichols, Kelly","Novack, Gary","Schrader, Stefan","Willcox, Mark","Wolffsohn, James","Sullivan, David A","Wendy Chao","Carlos Belmonte","Jos\u00e9 M.
