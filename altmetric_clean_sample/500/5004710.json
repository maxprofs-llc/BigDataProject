After swab-based field sampling, the organothiophosphate malathion was analyzed using DART-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS). Mass resolution was documented to be over 800,000 in full-scan MS mode and over 1,000,000 for an MS\/MS product ion produced by collision-induced dissociation of the protonated analyte. Mass measurement accuracy below 1 ppm was obtained for all DART-generated ions that belonged to the test compound in the mass spectra acquired using only external mass calibration. This high mass measurement accuracy, achievable at present only through FTMS, was required for unequivocal identification of the corresponding molecular formulae.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e6e","authors":["Laszlo Prokai"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijms17010116","first_seen_on":"2016-01-17T17:07:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1422-0067"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1452975139,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/1\/116\/html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1422-0067\/17\/1\/116\/pdf","pmid":"26784186","pubdate":"2016-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) of an Organothiophosphate at Ultrahigh Resolution by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry and Tandem Mass Spectrometry","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-analysis-real-time-dart-organothiophosphate-ultrahigh-resolution-fourier-transform-ion-cyclot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6978736,"mean":6.2380718316401,"rank":5988976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6978736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313844,"mean":9.1311469492706,"rank":256685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313844,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3979,"mean":2.2500799396682,"rank":2943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3979,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":2.0617363344051,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Laboratory","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=941839585903439&id=345487568871980","license":"public","citation_ids":[5004710,5004711],"posted_on":"2016-01-16T20:12:19+00:00","summary":"Check out the IJMS special issue \"Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry in Molecular Sciences\" edited by Laszlo Prokai: http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/ijms\/special_issues\/molecular-sciences.
