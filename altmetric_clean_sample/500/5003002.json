We describe the case of seven year old girl, who suffered from left internal carotid artery dissection following adenoidectomy, leading to right hemiplegia with global aphasia. A CT angiogram confirmed a loop in contralateral right internal carotid artery. It is presumed that a similar loop also existed in left internal carotid artery, which possibly extended medially close to posterior pharyngeal wall and was injured during the course of surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Arun garg","Yeeshu Singh","Pankaj Singh","Gaurav goyal","Sushant
