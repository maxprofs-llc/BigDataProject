Using gas chromatography, 43 fatty acids were analyzed in atrial and ventricular myocardium and in pericardial fluid of male Wistar rats. To examine the endogenous fatty acid metabolism, precursors were administered into the pericardial sac. Pro- and anti-inflammatory actions were induced by talc or fenofibrate, respectively. Physical exercise and a sedentary obese state were used for increased beta-oxidation. DHA (22:6n-3) was increased in ventricular when compared with atrial myocardium (9.0 \u00b1 2.1% vs. 4.7 \u00b1 1.0%, p < 0.001). Intrapericardial EPA (20:5n-3) application lead to an increase of the succeeding tetracosapentaenoic acid (24:5n-3) in atrial myocardium, which is a key precursor of DHA. In contrast, proinflammatory stimulation of the n-6 HUFA pathway did not influence the n-3 metabolism. Exercise- and obesity-induced increased beta-oxidation, the finalizing step of DHA synthesis, was associated with increased ventricular DHA concentrations (6.7 \u00b1 1.0% vs. 8.4 \u00b1 1.2%, p < 0.01). It is concluded that the endogenous metabolism contributes markedly to myocardial HUFA concentrations. The findings are supposed to influence the efficacy of oral HUFA treatment and provide a rationale for divergent findings of previous trials on omega-3 therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db0","authors":["Tobias Gl\u00fcck","Heinz Rupp","Peter Alter","Gl\u00fcck, Tobias","Rupp, Heinz","Alter, Peter"],"doi":"10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0300","endpage":"15","first_seen_on":"2016-01-19T00:05:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0008-4212","1205-7541"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1455131468,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/full\/10.1139\/cjpp-2015-0300","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780261?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26780261"],"pmid":"26780261","pubdate":"2015-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Mechanisms increasing n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids in the heart.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-increasing-n3-highly-unsaturated-fatty-acids-heart"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7168681,"mean":6.3131530881527,"rank":3078927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4019150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7168681,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316552,"mean":9.2550350622804,"rank":129333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":181787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316552,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":2.693225308642,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":1.4525,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
