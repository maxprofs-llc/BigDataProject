Panel A represents surface electrocardiogram showing narrow QRS tachycardia with RR alternans and 2:1 VA relation. Panel B represents intracardiac electrogram showing AV nodal reentrant tachycardia with alternation between two antegrade conduction times with retrograde conduction to atrium occurring only after longer antegrade conduction. The underlying morphological substrate behind this interesting phenomenon is not known. There may be potential mechanisms possible like antegrade conduction alternating between anatomically or functionally distinct antegrade pathways and retrograde conduction to atrium occurring only after longer antegrade conduction probably due to longer preceding HH interval or two antegrade conducting pathways with separate turn around points with one not retrogradely conducting to the atrium or multiple potential exits of the circuit with one not retrogradely conducting to the atrium.
