The following terms were searched: fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, fetal alcohol syndrome, prenatal alcohol exposure, and alcohol related birth defects.\nThirteen articles were gathered, five original investigations and eight reviews. This review identified several abnormalities in the body systems discussed and their associations to fetal alcohol syndrome.\nEvidence shows that the brain was the most severely impacted organ of the body systems discussed. However, prenatal alcohol exposure causes several abnormalities within the heart, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the endocrine systems. In addition, preventative measures need to be taken by mothers during pregnancy.
