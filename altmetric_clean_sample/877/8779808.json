This procedure involves mild conditions, avoids harmful waste, and is compatible with a range of substituted arenes and allylic silanes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Zhu, Jiangtao","P\u00e9rez, Manuel","Stephan, Douglas W."],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201603627","first_seen_on":"2016-06-16T06:01:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
