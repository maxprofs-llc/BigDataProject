Hence, the aim of this study was determined the effectiveness and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 15 disinfectants commonly used in the food industry in Mexico.\nThe antimicrobial activity and the MIC were determined according to AOAC and CLSI, respectively, with approved strains.\nMost disinfectants reduced 99.999% of microorganisms in suspension after 30s of contact, so reduction rate corresponded at least 5 Log10. Only for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, did all disinfectants have 99.999% effectiveness. For the MIC, only the third generation quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) in acid medium did not have values within the range in which is used in the food industry for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. In addition, for all disinfectants the MIC at 5min was two to four times greater than the concentration with the same effect at 10min; moreover, in most cases there was no difference in the MIC at 10 and 15min (p>0.05).\nAt recommended concentrations, disinfectants had bactericidal activity for at least three of the six microorganisms evaluated. However, the MIC was affected by the exposure time: it was bigger at 5min than at 10min; moreover, in the majority of the cases, it was equal at 10 and 15min; with the results we could have a better understanding of disinfectants use in food processing environments.","altmetric_jid":"521611773cf058827c00004c","authors":["I\u00f1iguez-Moreno, Maricarmen","Avila-Novoa, Mar\u00eda Guadalupe","I\u00f1iguez-Moreno, Elizabeth","Guerrero-Medina, Pedro Javier","Guti\u00e9rrez-Lomel\u00ed, Melesio","Maricarmen I\u00f1iguez-Moreno","Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Avila-Novoa","Elizabeth I\u00f1iguez-Moreno","Pedro Javier Guerrero-Medina","Melesio Guti\u00e9rrez-Lomel\u00ed"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jgar.2017.05.013","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T08:24:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2213-7165","2213-7173","22137165"],"journal":"Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance","last_mentioned_on":1506796249,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28732782?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S2213716517301005\/20170913T205600Z\/1?md5=6b264295338c2436992d7a2561ff3d7e"],"pmid":"28732782","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Antimicrobial activity of disinfectants commonly used in the food industry in Mexico","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-activity-disinfectants-commonly-used-food-industry-mexico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":2.25,"3m":2.25,"1m":1,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":1,"3d":1,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":3576374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4831896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229110,"mean":12.904703193676,"rank":88708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":137897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229110,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":1.6847979274611,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.3484375,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/889400782176440320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22304871],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:24:05+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
