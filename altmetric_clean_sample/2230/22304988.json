In 2016, the International Agency for Research on Cancer downgraded this classification due to lack of evidence from prospective studies particularly for never smokers.\nBaseline coffee drinking was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire in the NIH-AARP prospective cohort study. Among 469,047 US adults, who were cancer free at baseline, 6,012 bladder cancer cases (5,088 men and 924 women) were identified during >6.3 million person-years of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with non-coffee drinkers as the reference group.\nCoffee drinking was positively associated with bladder cancer in models adjusted for age and sex (HR for \u22654 cups\/d relative to coffee nondrinkers = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.70, 2.14; P trend < 0.0001). However, the association was substantially attenuated after adjustment for cigarette smoking and other potential confounders (HR for \u22654 cups\/d relative to coffee nondrinkers = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.33; P trend = 0.0007). Associations were further attenuated after additional adjustment for lifetime smoking patterns among the majority of the cohort with this available data (P trend = 0.16). There was no evidence of an association among never smokers (P trend = 0.84).\nPositive associations between coffee drinking and bladder cancer among ever smokers but not never smokers suggest that residual confounding from imperfect measurement of smoking or unmeasured risk factors may be an explanation for our positive findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072c5","authors":["Loftfield, Erikka","Freedman, Neal D.","Inoue-Choi, Maki","Graubard, Barry I.","Sinha, Rashmi"],"doi":"10.1097\/ede.0000000000000676","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T08:32:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1044-3983","1531-5487"],"issue":"5","journal":"Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1501418446,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/epidem\/Abstract\/publishahead\/A_prospective_investigation_of_coffee_drinking_and.98854.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/epidem\/9000\/00000\/A_prospective_investigation_of_coffee_drinking_and.98854.pdf","pmid":"28768299","pubdate":"2017-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"A prospective investigation of coffee drinking and bladder cancer incidence in the United States","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/epidem\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/A_prospective_investigation_of_coffee_drinking_and.98854.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-investigation-coffee-drinking-bladder-cancer-incidence-united-states"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.2,"score_history":{"1y":15.2,"6m":15.2,"3m":15.2,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":561734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7733626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181432,"mean":11.654941206299,"rank":20043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":161346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181432,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":8.8727045454545,"rank":210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2077,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":21.027870967742,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":7,"practitioner":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":4,"Scientists":7,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Computer Science":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ZA":1,"PE":1,"US":4,"GB":4,"GE":1,"NG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Kenn_QBE\/statuses\/889402816300802049","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3820455,6418632,22304988],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:32:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Food Forensics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/683532656332636160\/ZmJWI9Nn_normal.jpg","description":"Exposing & Eliminating Heinous,Immoral F&B Prod's Fraud & Health Abuse\/s committed by the F&B \/ HOSPITALITY\/ RETAIL Indust's & GOVT'S.\n \nWithout Prejudice","id_on_source":"Kenn_QBE","tweeter_id":"408770774","geo":{"lt":-29,"ln":24,"country":"ZA"},"followers":3652},"tweet_id":"889402816300802049"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EpidemiologyLWW\/statuses\/889448371848491012","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22304988],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T11:33:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Epidemiology","url":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/epidem\/pages\/default.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/557941207532204032\/RdoLMKBa_normal.jpeg","description":"Epidemiology publishes original research from all fields of epidemiology.
