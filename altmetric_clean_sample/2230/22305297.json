Among the 163 challenged archived isolates, some false-negative or uninterpretable results were detected mostly among ESC-nonsusceptible isolates with AmpC\/VIM\/OXA-48-like enzymes.\n\u03b2LACTA may be effectively applied in regions where ESC nonsusceptibility among Enterobacteriaceae is mainly due to ESBL, KPC or NDM \u03b2-lactamases.","altmetric_jid":"521611773cf058827c00004c","authors":["Vrioni, Georgia","Mamali, Vasiliki","Zarkotou, Olympia","Voulgari, Evaggelia","Dimitroulia, Evaggelia","Themeli-Digalaki, Katerina","Pournaras, Spyros","Tsakris, Athanassios"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jgar.2017.05.018","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T08:55:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2213-7165","2213-7173"],"journal":"Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance","last_mentioned_on":1500886477,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28732790?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28732790","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Performance of the \u03b2LACTA test for rapid detection of expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-nonsusceptible  Enterobacteriaceae","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/performance-%CE%B2-lacta-test-rapid-detection-expandedspectrum-cephalosporinnonsusceptible-enterobacteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":7149191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168872,"mean":11.500445713,"rank":137732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168872,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":1.6891098265896,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.1977777777778,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Immunology and Microbiology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/889408466950815744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22305297],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:54:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":548},"tweet_id":"889408466950815744"}]}}
