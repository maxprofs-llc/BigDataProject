In this post-intervention review, we sought to establish whether the effect on antibiotic use and guideline adherence was sustainable.\nA retrospective review of 87 patients, admitted to the 24-bed MICU, was done 3 (n\u00a0=\u00a045) and 6\u00a0months (n\u00a0=\u00a042) after the intervention.\nData included demographics, severity indicators, admitting pathology, infectious diagnosis, clinical outcomes [mechanical ventilation days (MVD) and MICU length of stay (LOS), antibiotic days of therapy (DOT), in-hospital mortality], and antibiotic appropriateness based on current guidelines.\nIn the 3-month (3-PI) and 6-month post-intervention (6-PI), there were no significant differences in the APACHE II score, MVD, LOS, DOT, or total antibiotic use at 3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.59) and 6-PI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.87). There was no change in the mean use of extended-spectrum penicillins, cephalosporin, and carbapenems. While there were significant differences in vancomycin usage at 3-PI [3.1 DOT vs. 4.3 DOT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007)], this finding was not seen after 6 months [3.1 DOT vs. 3.4 DOT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08)]. When compared to the intervention period, the inappropriateness of antibiotic use at 3 (p\u00a0=\u00a01.00) and 6-PI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.30) did not change significantly.\nThere were no significant differences in either total antibiotic use or inappropriate antibiotic use at the 6-PI time period. Continuous, daily, direct collaboration between ID and CCP, once implemented, can have lasting effects even at 6\u00a0months after the interaction has been discontinued.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["Shah, Kaushal B.","Rimawi, Ramzy H.","Mazer, Mark A.","Cook, Paul P.","Kaushal B.
