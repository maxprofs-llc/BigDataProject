Definitional inconsistency inevitably leads to challenges in measuring empowerment; yet if it is as important as is claimed, this must be addressed. This paper discusses the complexities of measuring empowerment and puts forward a number of recommendations for researchers and policy makers as to how this can be achieved noting some of the tensions that may arise between theoretical considerations, research and practice. We argue that empowerment is a culturally and socially defined construct and that this should be taken into account in attempts to measure it. Finally we conclude that, in order to build up the evidence base for empowerment, there is a need for research clearly defining what it is and how it is being measured.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c66","authors":["Ruth Cross","James Woodall","Louise Warwick-Booth"],"doi":"10.1177\/1757975917703304","first_seen_on":"2017-07-24T08:18:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1757-9759","1757-9767"],"journal":"Promotion & Education","last_mentioned_on":1501425333,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/eprint\/67MGpnS93pYTg5AGbjME\/full","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/eprint\/67MGpnS93pYTg5AGbjME\/full#articleShareContainer","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/1757975917703304"],"pmid":"28730930","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","education"],"title":"Empowerment: challenges in measurement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/empowerment-challenges-measurement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.7,"score_history":{"1y":18.7,"6m":18.7,"3m":18.7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":461890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7833946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181463,"mean":11.653346088988,"rank":17236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":164201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181463,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":3.204766066838,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":9,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":15,"researcher":5,"practitioner":8},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":15,"Scientists":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":8,"US":9,"CA":2,"ZA":1,"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WoodallDr\/statuses\/889399375960702977","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22304748],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:18:30+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr James Woodall","url":"http:\/\/www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk\/staff\/dr-james-woodall\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/479601123880599554\/ZLY1pnhI_normal.jpeg","description":"Head of Subject & Reader in Health Promotion, Leeds Beckett University.","id_on_source":"WoodallDr","tweeter_id":"555760840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1537},"tweet_id":"889399375960702977"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Drea_Mohan\/statuses\/889400663482011648","license":"gnip","rt":["WoodallDr"],"citation_ids":[22304748],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:23:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrea Mohan","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/902104024396247040\/yu4VNJHD_normal.jpg","description":"Behaviour change researcher in the area of prison healthcare and CVD prevention; amatuer kickboxer; music lover.","id_on_source":"Drea_Mohan","tweeter_id":"3040914549","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":132},"tweet_id":"889400663482011648"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/markgamsu\/statuses\/889402858491318272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22304748],"posted_on":"2017-07-24T08:32:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Mark Gamsu","url":"http:\/\/www.localdemocracyandhealth.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1609047503\/Harrys_graduation_0003_final_copy_normal.jpg","description":"Prof @LeedBeckett Focus on tackling health inequality, citizenship, local govt & vol sector.
