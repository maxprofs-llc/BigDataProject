Based on successful experiments in mouse AD models, active immunization with A\u03b242 peptide and passive immunizations with anti-A\u03b242 antibodies were started in clinical trials. Active A\u03b242 peptide immunization in humans had led to an inflammatory autoimmune response, and the trial was stopped. Passive immunizations had shown some effects in slowing AD pathology. Active DNA A\u03b242 immunizations administered with the gene gun into the skin elicits a different immune response and is non-inflammatory. While in rodents, good responses had been found for this type of immunization, positive results in larger mammals are missing. We present here results from sixteen New Zealand White Rabbits, which underwent intradermal DNA A\u03b242 immunization via gene gun. The humoral immune response was analyzed from blood throughout the study, and cellular immune responses were determined from spleens at the end of the study. A good anti-A\u03b2 antibody response was found in the rabbit model. The T cell response after re-stimulation in cell culture showed no IFN\u03b3 producing cells when ELISPOT assays were analyzed from PBMC, but low numbers of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 producing cells were found in ELISPOTS from spleens (both 5 immunizations). Brains from immunized rabbits showed no signs of encephalitis. Based on these results, DNA A\u03b242 immunization is highly likely to be safe and effective to test in a possible clinical AD prevention trial in patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Doris Lambracht-Washington","Min Fu","Mary Wight-Carter","Matthew Riegel","Roger N.
