Larger changes were significantly associated with several baseline measures: greater numbers of precap medications, greater numbers of comorbidities, longer hospitalizations, and greater use of ambulatory services. The three comorbidities associated with the largest relative reduction in essential drug use were psychoses\/bipolar disorders, anxiety\/sleep problems, and chronic pain. Patients of physicians in group practices, clinics, or hospitals tended to have smaller dose reductions than those whose physicians were in solo or small-group practice.\nPatients most at risk of reduced access to essential medications because of a reimbursement cap include those with multiple chronic illnesses requiring drug therapy, especially illnesses with a mental health component. Physicians in clinics or large group practices may have maintained patient medication regimens more effectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Fortess, E E","Soumerai, S B","McLaughlin, T J","Ross-Degnan, D"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-24T22:24:29+00:00","issns":["0002-8614"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1313182800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11454120"],"pmid":"11454120","pubdate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Utilization of essential medications by vulnerable older people after a drug benefit cap: importance of mental disorders, chronic pain, and practice setting.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilization-essential-medications-vulnerable-older-people-after-drug-benefit-cap-importance-mental-d"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.136,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.136},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7281060,"mean":6.3661679791325,"rank":1279788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6000777,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7281060,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92988,"mean":12.641729360018,"rank":23246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":69741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92988,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3222,"mean":11.285017075442,"rank":1094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3222,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":16.302083333333,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
