As a surface water contaminant, \u03b1-cypermethrin may have severe ecological impacts on amphibians. Here, we examined the acute toxicity of \u03b1-cypermethrin enantiomers to dark-spotted frog Rana nigromaculata tadpoles at 24, 48, 72 and 96h, finding that the tadpoles were indeed sensitive to \u03b1-cypermethrin. The (S)-(1R, 3R)-enantiomer was approximately 29 times more toxic than the (R)-(1S, 3S)-enantiomer at 96h. A significant delayed growth in R. nigromaculata tadpoles after exposure to 0.5\u00b5gL(-1) of S-(1R, 3R)-cypermethrin was observed. Additionally, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels indicate the presence of oxidative stress in the tadpoles. Further, tadpoles exposed to sublethal concentrations of \u03b1-cypermethrin enantiomers exhibited enantioselective growth and oxidative damage. Bioaccumulation experiments showed that the tadpoles could rapidly accumulate \u03b1-cypermethrin. The (R)-(1S, 3S)-enantiomer was preferentially accumulated over the (S)-(1R, 3R)-enantiomer, and it was also eliminated more quickly, as evidenced in the subsequent depuration experiments.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","authors":["Peng Xu","Ledan Huang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2017.02.015","first_seen_on":"2017-02-24T21:02:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01476513"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1487969985,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0147651317300799"],"pmid":"28208115","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effects of \u03b1-cypermethrin enantiomers on the growth, biochemical parameters and bioaccumulation in Rana nigromaculata tadpoles of the anuran amphibians","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0147651317300799","volume":"139","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-%CE%B1cypermethrin-enantiomers-growth-biochemical-parameters-bioaccumulation-rana-nigromaculata-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":7149178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242593,"mean":13.668900037923,"rank":202236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242593,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1632,"mean":2.5418332311465,"rank":1041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1632,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.4467252747253,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
