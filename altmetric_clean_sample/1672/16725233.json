However, efficacy trials evaluating infectious diseases as outcomes are scarce and inconclusive.\nTo investigate the effect of daily multivitamin-mineral and vitamin E supplementation on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in elderly individuals.\nA randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial.\nA total of 652 noninstitutionalized individuals aged 60 years or older enrolled from 2 community-based sampling strategies in the Wageningen area of the Netherlands, conducted from 1998 to 2000. At baseline, 6% of participants had suboptimal ascorbic acid and 1.3% had suboptimal alpha-tocopherol plasma concentration.\nPhysiological doses of multivitamin-minerals, 200 mg of vitamin E, both, or placebo.\nIncidence and severity of self-reported acute respiratory tract infections at 15 months, as assessed by a nurse (telephone contact), home visits, and microbiological and serological testing in subsets of patients.\nDuring a median observation period of 441 days, 443 (68%) of 652 participants recorded 1024 respiratory tract infection episodes. The incidence rate ratio of acute respiratory tract infection for multivitamin-mineral supplementation was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.15; P =.58) and for vitamin E supplementation, 1.12 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.25; P =.21). Severity of infections was not influenced by multivitamin-mineral supplementation. For vitamin E vs no vitamin E, severity was worse: median (interquartile range) for illness-duration was 19 (9-37) vs 14 (6-29) days, P =.02; number of symptoms, 6 (3-8) vs 4 (3-8), P =.03; presence of fever, 36.7% vs 25.2%, P =.009; and restriction of activity, 52.3% vs 41.1%, P =.02.\nNeither daily multivitamin-mineral supplementation at physiological dose nor 200 mg of vitamin E showed a favorable effect on incidence and severity of acute respiratory tract infections in well-nourished noninstitutionalized elderly individuals. Instead we observed adverse effects of vitamin E on illness severity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c38","authors":["Graat, Judith M","Schouten, Evert G","Kok, Frans J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-24T22:20:26+00:00","issns":["0098-7484"],"issue":"6","journal":"JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1318366800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12169075"],"pmid":"12169075","pubdate":"2002-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Effect of daily vitamin E and multivitamin-mineral supplementation on acute respiratory tract infections in elderly persons: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"288","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-daily-vitamin-e-multivitaminmineral-supplementation-acute-respiratory-tract-infections-elderl-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.136,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.136},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7281060,"mean":6.3661679791325,"rank":1279752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6000783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7281060,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92977,"mean":12.640065049045,"rank":23242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":69734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92977,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17957,"mean":33.800420806416,"rank":8990,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":8965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17957,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":115.50381818182,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Vitamin E and the Risk of Prostate Cancer: The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT","url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1001\/jama.2011.1437","license":"public","citation_ids":[16725206,111951,111951,1747322,1747322,16725210,16725210,16725219,16725219,2447341,2447341,184926,184926,5097694,5097694,16725223,16725225,1332451,1332451,131819,131819,860112,860112,188769,188769,4034471,4034471,549026,549026,187716,187716,107478,107478,16725228,2083792,408146,408146,128095,1950318,187327,187327,107479,107479,418443,418443,2468625,2468625,16725233,2837661,384633,384633,3156972,3156972,3164346,3164346,1018151,1018151,185137,185137,16725234,16725234],"posted_on":"2011-10-11T21:00:00+00:00","summary":"Interview with Eric A.
