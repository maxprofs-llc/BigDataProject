One Y-Family-class includes DNAP \u03ba and DNAP IV, which accurately insert dCTP opposite N(2)-dG adducts, including from the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP). Another class includes DNAP \u03b7 and DNAP V, which insert accurately opposite UV-damage, but inaccurately opposite BP-N(2)-dG. To investigate structural differences between Y-Family-classes, regions are swapped between DNAP IV (a \u03ba\/IV-class-member) and Dpo4 (a \u03b7\/V-class-member); the kinetic consequences are evaluated via primer-extension studies with a BP-N(2)-dG-containing template. Four key structural elements are revealed. (1) Y-Family DNAPs have discreet non-covalent contacts between their little finger-domain (LF-Domain) and their catalytic core-domain (CC-Domain), which we call \"non-covalent bridges\" (NCBs). Arg37 and Arg38 in DNAP IV's CC-Domain near the active site form a non-covalent bridge (AS-NCB) by interacting with Glu251 and Asp252, respectively, in DNAP IV's LF-Domain. Without these interactions dATP\/dGTP\/dTTP misinsertions increase. DNAP IV's AS-NCB suppresses misinsertions better than Dpo4's equivalent AS-NCB. (2) DNAP IV also suppresses dATP\/dGTP\/dTTP misinsertions via a second non-covalent bridge, which is \u223c8\u00c5 from the active site (Distal-NCB). Dpo4 has no Distal-NCB, rendering it inferior at dATP\/dGTP\/dTTP suppression. (3) dCTP insertion is facilitated by the larger minor groove opening near the active site in DNAP IV versus Dpo4, which is sensible given that Watson\/Crick-like [dCTP:BP-N(2)-dG] pairing requires the BP-moiety to be in the minor groove. (4) Compared to Dpo4, DNAP IV has a smaller major groove opening, which suppresses dGTP misinsertion, implying BP-N(2)-dG bulk in the major groove during Hoogsteen syn-adduct-dG:dGTP pairing. In summary, DNAP IV has a large minor groove opening to enhance dCTP insertion, a plugged major groove opening to suppress dGTP misinsertion, and two non-covalent bridges (near and distal to the active site) to suppress dATP\/dGTP\/dTTP misinsertions; collectively these four structural features enhance DNAP IV's dNTP insertion fidelity opposite a BP-N(2)-dG adduct compared to Dpo4.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002726","authors":["Sholder, Gabriel","Creech, Amanda","Loechler, Edward L"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dnarep.2015.09.020","endpage":"153","first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T10:49:14+00:00","issns":["1568-7856","15687864"],"journal":"DNA Repair","last_mentioned_on":1466763695,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26523515?dopt=Abstract&http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/eutils\/erss.cgi?rss_guid=12auu1PYsGCNpo6akauPh2r5KY5WDOs2B1hbPBXflIdOhD8YA8"],"pmid":"26523515","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"144","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"How Y-Family DNA polymerase IV is more accurate than Dpo4 at dCTP insertion opposite an N2-dG adduct of benzo[a]pyrene","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yfamily-dna-polymerase-iv-more-accurate-dpo4-dctp-insertion-opposite-n2dg-adduct-benzoapyrene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":6872547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262112,"mean":11.545667339409,"rank":219538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":2.9673347639485,"rank":370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.2759259259259,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Student  > Ph.
