Bound phage counts using ELISA were performed to identify phage clones carrying the most highly selective peptide, which termed RP-1. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis indicated that the consensus peptide RP-1 could bind to CD44-positive gastric cancer cells with mean fluorescence intensities significantly higher than that of CD44-negative cells. CD44 knockdown led to decreased binding activity of RP-1 to the same cell line. Tissue array technique was used to identify the relationship (r\u00a0=\u00a00.556) between peptide binding and CD44 detection on gastric cancer tissues. Further, the hyaluronan-binding domain of CD44 was docked with RP-1 using computer modeling\/docking approaches, revealing a RP-1\/CD44 interaction with geometrical and energy match (-8.6\u00a0kcal\/mol).\nThe RP-1 peptide we screened exhibits affinity and specificity to CD44 on cells and has the potential to be used as a candidate probe for gastric cancer cell targeting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f6100064bd","authors":["Zhang, Dan","Jia, Huan","Wang, Yan","Li, Wei-Ming","Hou, Ying-Chun","Yin, Shi-Wei","Wang, Thomas D","He, Shui-Xiang","Lu, Shao-Ying"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10529-015-1896-z","endpage":"2320","first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T11:06:32+00:00","issns":["1573-6776","0141-5492"],"issue":"11","journal":"Biotechnology Letters","last_mentioned_on":1466765282,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26140900?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26140900","pubdate":"2015-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"2311","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"A CD44 specific peptide developed by phage display for targeting gastric cancer","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd44-specific-peptide-developed-phage-display-targeting-gastric-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":4165704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2216245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262112,"mean":11.545657992224,"rank":142026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262112,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":2.1738398510242,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.85576923076923,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
