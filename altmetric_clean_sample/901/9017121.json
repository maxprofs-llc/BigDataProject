Both patterns also occur in models of MTLE in vivo and in vitro, and these studies have highlighted the predominant involvement of distinct neuronal network\/neu-rotransmitter receptor signaling in each of them. First, LVF onset seizures in epileptic rodents can originate from several limbic structures, frequently spread, and are associated with high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the ripple band (80-200 Hz), while HYP onset seizures initiate in the hippocampus, and tend to remain focal with predominant fast ripples (250-500 Hz). Second, in vitro intracellular recordings from principal cells in limbic areas indicate that pharmacologically induced, seizure-like discharges with LVF onset are initiated by a synchronous inhibitory event or by a hyperpolarizing IPSPs barrage; in contrast, HYP onset is associated with a progressive impairement of inhibition and concomitant unrestrained enhance\u00acment of excitation. Finally, in vitro optogenetic experiments show that under comparable experimental conditions (i.e., 4-aminopyridine application), the initiation of LVF or HYP onset seizures depends on the preponderant involvement of interneuronal or principal cell networks, respec\u00actively. Overall, these data may provide insight to delineate better therapeutic targets in the treatment of patients presenting with MTLE and, perhaps, with other epileptic disorders as well.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e78","authors":["Massimo Avoli","Marco de Curtis","Vadym Gnatkovsky","Jean Gotman","R\u00fcdiger K\u00f6hling","Maxime L\u00e9vesque","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Manseau","Zahra Shiri","Sylvain Williams"],"doi":"10.1152\/jn.01128.2015","first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T13:39:39+00:00","issns":["1522-1598"],"journal":"Journal of Neurophysiology","last_mentioned_on":1466775295,"links":["http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/115\/6\/3229"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jn.physiology.org\/content\/jn\/115\/6\/3229.full.pdf","pmid":"27075542","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"jn.01128.2015","subjects":["physiology","neurology"],"title":"Specific imbalance of excitatory\/inhibitory signaling establishes seizure onset pattern in temporal lobe epilepsy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specific-imbalance-excitatoryinhibitory-signaling-establishes-seizure-onset-pattern-temporal-lobe-ep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":6019789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1067839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262111,"mean":11.545634512227,"rank":183642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":42586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262111,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3221,"mean":3.7532080745342,"rank":2397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3221,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":3.572747826087,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
