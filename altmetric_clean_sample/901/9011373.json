Most patients respond to current standard of care, i.e., bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs, but in some adequate asthma control cannot be achieved with standard treatments. These difficult-to-treat patients would be the target population for new biological therapies. At present, omalizumab is the only biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation. Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies on larger groups of patients are needed to confirm their safety and efficacy.","aggregated_in":[12509476],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Rubinsztajn, Renata","Chazan, Ryszarda","Renata Rubinsztajn","Ryszarda Chazan"],"book":{"title":"Pulmonary Infection and Inflammation","isbns":["9783319444840","9783319444857"],"uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44485-7"},"doi":"10.1007\/5584_2016_29","editors":["Mieczyslaw Pokorski"],"first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T11:11:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0065-2598","2214-8019"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1466765649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27334730?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007\/5584_2016_29"],"ordinal_number":29,"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F5584_2016_29.pdf","pmid":"27334730","pubdate":"2016-06-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"series":{"title":"Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology","issn":"0065-2598"},"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Monoclonal Antibodies for the Management of Severe Asthma","type":"chapter","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/chapter\/10.1007%2F5584_2016_29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/monoclonal-antibodies-management-severe-asthma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":6872540,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262111,"mean":11.545694983022,"rank":219535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262111,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2316,"mean":3.1881105831533,"rank":1732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2316,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.5177777777778,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/asthma_papers\/statuses\/746295342912536576","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9011373,12509476],"posted_on":"2016-06-24T10:54:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Asthma Papers","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/439482171208646656\/OWe4b0kE_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed for #asthma papers in #Pubmed.
