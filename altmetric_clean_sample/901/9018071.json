The efficacy and safety of autologous BM-MSC transplantation in the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) were investigated. Seventy-two patients with baseline biopsy-proven AC who had been alcohol-abstinent for more than 6 months underwent a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: one control group and two autologous BM-MSC groups that underwent either one-time or two-time hepatic arterial injections of 5 \u00d7 10(7) BM-MSCs 30 days after bone marrow aspiration. A follow-up biopsy was performed 6 months after enrollment and adverse events were monitored for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the improvement in the fibrosis-quantification based on Picrosirius-red staining. The secondary endpoints included liver function tests, Child-Pugh score, and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score. The outcomes were analyzed by per-protocol analysis. In terms of fibrosis-quantification (before vs. after), one-time and two-time BM-MSC groups were associated with 25% (19.5\u00b19.5% vs. 14.5\u00b17.1%) and 37% (21.1\u00b18.9% vs. 13.2\u00b16.7%) reductions in the proportion of collagen, respectively (P<0.001). In the inter-group comparison, two-time BM-MSC transplantation in comparison with one-time BM-MSC transplantation was not associated with improved results in fibrosis-quantification (P>0.05). The Child-Pugh scores of both BM-MSC groups (one-time: 7.6\u00b11.0 vs. 6.3\u00b11.3 and two-time: 7.8\u00b11.2 vs. 6.8\u00b11.6) were also significantly improved following BM-MSC transplantation (P<0.05). The proportion of patients with adverse events did not differ among the three groups.\nAutologous BM-MSC transplantation safely improved histologic fibrosis and liver function in patients with AC.
