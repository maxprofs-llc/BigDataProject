Metabolic activation of NNK generates a number of DNA adducts including O(2)-methylthymidine (O(2)-Me-dT) and O(2)-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]thymidine (O(2)-POB-dT). To investigate the biological effects of these O(2)-alkylthymidines in humans, we have replicated plasmids containing a site-specifically incorporated O(2)-Me-dT or O(2)-POB-dT in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. The bulkier O(2)-POB-dT exhibited high genotoxicity and only 26% translesion synthesis (TLS) occurred, while O(2)-Me-dT was less genotoxic and allowed 55% TLS. However, O(2)-Me-dT was 20% more mutagenic (mutation frequency (MF) 64%) compared to O(2)-POB-dT (MF 53%) in HEK293T cells. The major type of mutations in each case was targeted T\u2192A transversions (56% and 47%, respectively, for O(2)-Me-dT and O(2)-POB-dT). Both lesions induced a much lower frequency of T\u2192G, the dominant mutation in bacteria. siRNA knockdown of the TLS polymerases (pols) indicated that pol \u03b7, pol \u03b6, and Rev1 are involved in the lesion bypass of O(2)-Me-dT and O(2)-POB-dT as the TLS efficiency decreased with knockdown of each pol. In contrast, MF of O(2)-Me-dT was decreased in pol \u03b6 and Rev1 knockdown cells by 24% and 25%, respectively, while for O(2)-POB-dT, it was decreased by 44% in pol \u03b6 knockdown cells, indicating that these TLS pols are critical for mutagenesis. Additional decrease in both TLS efficiency and MF was observed in cells deficient in pol \u03b6 plus other Y-family pols. This study provided important mechanistic details on how these lesions are bypassed in human cells in both error-free and error-prone manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002726","authors":["Weerasooriya, Savithri","Jasti, Vijay P","Bose, Arindam","Spratt, Thomas E","Basu, Ashis K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dnarep.2015.09.023","endpage":"70","first_seen_on":"2016-06-24T10:26:31+00:00","issns":["1568-7856","15687864"],"journal":"DNA Repair","last_mentioned_on":1466763037,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26460881?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26460881","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Roles of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in the potent mutagenicity of tobacco-specific nitrosamine-derived O2-alkylthymidines in human cells","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-translesion-synthesis-dna-polymerases-potent-mutagenicity-tobaccospecific-nitrosaminederived-o-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7940332,"mean":6.711930007446,"rank":6872558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7940332,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262112,"mean":11.545678403424,"rank":219544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262112,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":2.9673347639485,"rank":370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.2759259259259,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sRNAPapers\/statuses\/746284384391565312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9010562],"posted_on":"2016-06-24T10:10:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Small RNA papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"sRNAPapers","tweeter_id":"3003428519","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"746284384391565312"}]}}
