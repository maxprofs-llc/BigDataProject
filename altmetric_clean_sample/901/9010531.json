Use of assisted reproductive technologies and therapies for ovarian protection improve fertility prospects. We evaluated whether patients had a documented fertility discussion (FD) with their oncology physician prior to therapy, what options were chosen, and if pregnancy was achieved.\nA retrospective chart review from 2006 to 2014 was performed to evaluate women aged 40\u00a0years and younger who were diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with chemotherapy and\/or antihormonal therapy. Patient demographics, treatment regimens, presence or absence of FD, in vitro fertilization (IVF) consultation, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist use, and subsequent successful pregnancy were analyzed.\nAmong 303 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 80 (26\u00a0%) had an FD with their physician documented; 71 of these 80 women (89\u00a0%) sought further fertility consultation and options. Sixteen (20\u00a0%) women were prescribed a GnRH agonist only for ovarian protection during chemotherapy, 50 (63\u00a0%) underwent IVF consultation only, and 5 (6\u00a0%) had both a GnRH agonist prescribed and an IVF consultation. The overall pregnancy rate was 7\u00a0% at a mean of 3\u00a0years post breast cancer treatment. Pregnancy after treatment was more common among those pursuing IVF consultation or prescribed a GnRH agonist.\nIn treating young breast cancer patients, it is important to assess fertility desire, discuss treatment risks relating to fertility, and discuss preservation options. Although not every woman in this group desired pregnancy, 71\/80 (89\u00a0%) women having a documented FD sought further fertility consultation and options.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["McCray, Devina K S","Simpson, Ashley B","Flykct, Rebecca","Liu, Yitian","O'Rourke, Colin","Crowe, Joseph P","Grobmyer, Stephen R","Moore, Halle C","Valente, Stephanie A","Devina K.
