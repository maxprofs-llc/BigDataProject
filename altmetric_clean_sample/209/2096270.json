While determining PMImin, the pupal period is given as the duration between the beginning of the pupal period and the stage of adult emergence. The pupal period constitutes approximately 50\u00a0% of the immature development, and with detailed examination it would be possible to present a much more accurate PMImin. In this study, the pupal period of Lucilia sericata (Meigen, 1826), which is one of the species used in PMImin estimation in forensic entomology, was investigated. Studies about the pupal period of development are considerably limited in the forensic entomology world. Stages and duration of the pupal period of Lucilia sericata were studied at temperatures of 20\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and 30\u00a0\u00b0C. For all temperatures, pupae specimens were dissected and photographed hourly. According to findings based on all three temperatures, it was determined that as the temperature increases, the duration of development shortens. Also, in addition to 11 pre-determined development stages, nine new development stages were identified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b69","authors":["Tu\u00e7e Karabey","Osman Sert"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00414-014-0968-2","first_seen_on":"2014-02-04T14:23:12+00:00","issns":["1437-1596","0937-9827"],"journal":"International Journal of Legal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1391523751,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00414-014-0968-2"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00414-014-0968-2.pdf","pmid":"24477452","pubdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Forensic Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Law","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"The analysis of pupal development period in Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) forensically important insect","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-pupal-development-period-lucilia-sericata-diptera-calliphoridae-forensically-important-inse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506116,"mean":5.115759950541,"rank":2325880,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1538663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506116,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123781,"mean":7.6631988851189,"rank":60563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":43159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123781,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":2.9694964028777,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.68333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":7,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/xemper\/status\/430707947296276481","license":"public","citation_ids":[2096270],"posted_on":"2014-02-04T14:22:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Mike Wilson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/726544261446008832\/b6jAuJTh_normal.jpg","description":"PhD student @SwanseaUni researching maggot therapy.
