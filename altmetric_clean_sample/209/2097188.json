Detailed translational and orientational characteristics of these superstructures were determined using a transmission electron microscopy tomographic technique with 3D reconstruction analysis. The formation of these distinct superlattices is the result of a delicate choice of solvent (i.e., aliphatic hexane or aromatic toluene hydrocarbons), which serves as a dispersion medium to fine-tune the relative strengths of ligand-ligand and ligand-solvent interactions during the self-assembly process. This work provides important insights into the effects of ligand-solvent interactions on superlattice formation from nonspherical nanoparticles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zewei Quan"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja408250q","first_seen_on":"2014-02-04T16:52:44+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1411554606,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja408250q?ref=tw","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24397381?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24397381","pubdate":"2014-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Solvent-Mediated Self-Assembly of Nanocube Superlattices.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solventmediated-selfassembly-nanocube-superlattices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2293139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2718686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138981,"mean":7.921071175709,"rank":55970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":82166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138981,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15516,"mean":4.5749131807928,"rank":9091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":6305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15516,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":5.1775512820513,"rank":208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
