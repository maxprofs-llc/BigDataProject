To generate a thick oxidation layer (<\u223c7 \u00b5m), a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) slab of uniform or varying thickness was exposed to UV\/ozone for less than 30 min in the UV-C wavelength including wavelengths of 185 and 254 nm. Subsequently, the PDMS slab was wrapped on a cylindrical support (radius: 11 mm) to apply a uniform bending strain (<21%), resulting in equally separated, anisotropic cracks over a large area. By modulating initial oxidation depth and applied bending stress, cracks of varying sizes and spaces were formed on a single PDMS slab. Furthermore, multiple, sequential cracks were generated by increasing the strain in a step-wise fashion and multi-directional cracks by applying the strain with an orientation angle. Finally, size and space-varying cracks were formed between two adjacent large channels in an interconnected format by selective masking and irreversible bonding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Hong-Nam Kim","Sung-Hoon Lee","Kahp-Yang Suh"],"doi":"10.1039\/c0lc00277a","endpage":"722","first_seen_on":"2014-02-05T07:35:30+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1473-0189","1473-0197"],"issue":"4","journal":"Lab on a Chip - Miniaturisation for Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1391585757,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2011\/LC\/c0lc00277a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/lc\/c0lc00277a","pmid":"21088797","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"717","subjects":["chemistry","biotechnology"],"title":"Controlled mechanical fracture for fabricating microchannels with various size gradients","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controlled-mechanical-fracture-fabricating-microchannels-various-size-gradients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":2328073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1534606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123672,"mean":7.6631310816604,"rank":60554,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":42964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123672,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1684,"mean":3.630495543672,"rank":686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1684,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":8.43,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
