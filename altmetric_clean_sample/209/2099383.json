The BL is generated by a cloud-to-ground lightning strike. It moves horizontally during the luminous duration. The evolution of size, color, and light intensity is reported in detail. The spectral analysis indicates that the radiation from soil elements is present for the entire lifetime of the BL.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Jianyong Cen","Ping Yuan","Simin Xue"],"first_seen_on":"2014-02-05T07:13:47+00:00","issns":["1079-7114"],"issue":"3","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1390005429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24484145"],"pmid":"24484145","pubdate":"2014-01-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Observation of the optical and spectral characteristics of ball lightning.","type":"article","volume":"112"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":108021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":3520267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110359,"mean":6.9436029830192,"rank":5242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":105070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110359,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11973,"mean":6.8050912128299,"rank":715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":11242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11973,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":11.267843260188,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Scientists accidentally record ball lightning in nature for first time","url":"http:\/\/news.cnet.com\/8301-11386_3-57617432-76\/scientists-accidentally-record-ball-lightning-in-nature-for-first-time\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[2064446,2099383],"posted_on":"2014-01-18T00:37:09+00:00","summary":"Chinese researchers have done the seemingly impossible: observed and recorded an instance of ball lightning completely by accident.
