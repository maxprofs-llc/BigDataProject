Because almost all studies focused on children with conduct problems or adult psychopaths, however, little is known about cognitive control mechanisms among the majority of persistent violent offenders who present an antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The present study aimed to determine whether offenders with ASPD, relative to non-offenders, display dysfunction in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and to assess the extent to which these dysfunctions are associated with psychopathic traits and trait impulsivity. Participants comprised 21 violent offenders and 23 non-offenders who underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a non-verbal Stroop task. The offenders, relative to the non-offenders, exhibited reduced response time interference and a different pattern of conflict- and error-related activity in brain areas involved in cognitive control, attention, language, and emotion processing, that is, the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, superior temporal and postcentral cortices, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala. Moreover, between-group differences in behavioural and neural responses revealed associations with core features of psychopathy and attentional impulsivity. Thus, the results of the present study confirmed the hypothesis that offenders with ASPD display alterations in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and that those alterations relate, at least in part, to personality characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d3","doi":"10.1016\/j.pscychresns.2014.01.008","first_seen_on":"2014-02-02T07:15:24+00:00","issns":["09254927"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging Section","last_mentioned_on":1415646618,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0925492714000237","http:\/\/www.psyn-journal.com\/article\/S0925-4927(14)00023-7\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24530294?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24530294"],"pmid":"24530294","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"title":"Neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control of men with lifelong antisocial behavior.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neural-mechanisms-underlying-cognitive-control-men-lifelong-antisocial-behavior"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":959532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3523310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123487,"mean":7.6887518423143,"rank":30388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":92441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123487,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":2.6830361445783,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
