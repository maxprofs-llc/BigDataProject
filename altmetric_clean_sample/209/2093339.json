In this study, we show that BCR-ABL-positive CML cell lines treated with imatinib (STI571) undergo G\u2081 cell cycle arrest associated with the accumulation of p57(Kip)\u00b2, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI). Interestingly, p57(Kip)\u00b2 increase precedes the reported STI571-dependent upregulation of p27(Kip)\u00b9. A number of complementary approaches allow the demonstration that p57(Kip)\u00b2 buildup is due to the transcriptional activation of CDKN1C, the p57(Kip)\u00b2-encoding gene, while neither p57(Kip)\u00b2 half-life elongation nor its cell relocalization were observed. We also identified a heretofore undescribed pattern of p57(Kip)\u00b2 phosphorylated isoforms which, however, did not change in response to STI571 cell treatment. The imatinib-dependent p57(Kip)\u00b2 upregulation occurs only in STI571-responsive cells, while the CKI accumulation was not evidenced in an imatinib-resistant clone. Nilotinib and dasatinib (second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors), at concentrations comparable to those used in therapy, increase the CKI but do not affect p27(Kip)\u00b9 level. Finally, CD34(+) cells from CML patients display a clear imatinib-dependent p57(Kip)\u00b2 upregulation, which was not observed in CD34(+) cells from control subjects. In conclusion, our study points to p57(Kip)\u00b2 as a novel and precocious effector of BCR-ABL targeting drugs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a7","doi":"10.1093\/carcin\/bgq211","first_seen_on":"2014-02-03T12:33:20+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1484226194,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/carcin\/bgq211"],"pmid":"20952511","pubdate":"2010-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"p57Kip2 is a downstream effector of BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p57kip2-downstream-effector-bcrabl-kinase-inhibitors-chronic-myelogenous-leukemia-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":4263843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2237038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193774,"mean":7.3722223529596,"rank":93111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":77182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193774,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2264,"mean":5.50483959346,"rank":1698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2264,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.5204545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
