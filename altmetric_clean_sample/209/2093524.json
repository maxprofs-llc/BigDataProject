In this report, IFNalpha increased eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF-1A) protein expression by inhibition of eEF-1A degradation via a proteasome-dependent pathway. The reduction of the expression level of eEF-1A by RNA interference enhanced the apoptosis induced by IFNalpha on the same cells. Moreover, IFNalpha induced the phosphorylation of both serine and threonine in eEF-1A. These effects were paralleled by an increased co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization of eEF-1A with C-Raf. The suppression of C-Raf kinase activity with the inhibitor BAY 43-9006 completely antagonized the increase of both eEF-1A phosphorylation and expression and of C-Raf\/eEF-1A colocalization induced by IFNalpha and enhanced apoptosis and eEF-1A ubiquitination. Cell transfection with the mutated K48R ubiquitin increased EF-1A expression and desensitized tumor cells to the modulating effects of IFNalpha. The dynamic simulation of 3Dstructure of eEF-1A identified putative serine and threonine phosphorylation sites. In conclusion, the interaction between eEF-1A and C-Raf increases eEF-1A stability and induces a survival activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["A Lamberti","O Longo","M Marra","P Tagliaferri","E Bismuto","A Fiengo","C Viscomi","A Budillon","U R Rapp","E Wang","S Venuta","A Abbruzzese","P Arcari","M Caraglia","Lamberti A","Longo O","Marra M","Tagliaferri P","Bismuto E","Fiengo A","Viscomi C","Budillon A","Rapp UR","Wang E","Venuta S","Abbruzzese A","Arcari P","Caraglia M"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.cdd.4402102","first_seen_on":"2014-02-03T12:51:21+00:00","issns":["1350-9047","1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1453565758,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.cdd.4402102"],"pmid":"17332776","pubdate":"2007-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"C-Raf antagonizes apoptosis induced by IFN-|[alpha]| in human lung cancer cells by phosphorylation and increase of the intracellular content of elongation factor 1A","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/sj.cdd.4402102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/craf-antagonizes-apoptosis-induced-ifnalpha-human-lung-cancer-cells-phosphorylation-increase-intrace"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7012411,"mean":6.2597681384832,"rank":3472818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2029636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7012411,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186432,"mean":7.1381344411608,"rank":86910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":76450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186432,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":5.4736265060241,"rank":653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.8971034482759,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
