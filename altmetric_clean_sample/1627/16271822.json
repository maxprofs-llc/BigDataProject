One member, PPARgamma, a critical transcription factor in adipogenesis, is expressed in ECV304 cells, and when activated participates in the induction of cell death by apoptosis. Here we describe a clone of ECV304 cells, ECV-ACO.Luc, which stably expresses a reporter gene for PPAR activation. ECV-ACO.Luc respond to the PPARgamma agonists, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ(2), and ciglitizone, by inducing luciferase expression. Furthermore, using ECV-ACO.Luc, we demonstrate that a newly described PPARgamma antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) has agonist activities. Similar to 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14) PGJ(2), BADGE induces PPARgamma activation, nuclear localization of the receptor, and induces cell death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["David Bishop-Bailey","Timothy Hla","Timothy D Warner"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.bjp.0703628","first_seen_on":"2017-02-09T19:10:58+00:00","issns":["00071188","14765381"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1486665816,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/11030710\/"],"pmcid":"PMC1572386","pmid":"11030710","pubdate":"2000-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) is a PPAR\u03b3 agonist in an ECV304 cell line","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1038\/sj.bjp.0703628","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bisphenol-diglycidyl-ether-badge-ppargamma-agonist-ecv304-cell-line"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":4100862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3873564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265135,"mean":12.851773978441,"rank":139427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":115447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265135,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2618,"mean":5.5527772258311,"rank":1598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2618,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":11.902470588235,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
