Uridine and its analogs, 3-deazauridine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and 6-azauridine, were found to competitively inhibit cytidine deaminase; the most potent inhibitor was 3-deazauridine (K(i) = 1.9 x 10(-5) M). In addition, deoxycytidylate deaminase, which degrades cytosine arabinoside monophosphate to the inactive uracil arabinoside monophosphate (K(m) = 9 x 10(-4) M), was competitively inhibited by 3-deazauridine monophosphate, as well as by the nucleotides of other uridine analogs. These results suggest that uridine analogs such as 3-deazauridine may have value in protecting cytosine arabinoside, 5-azacytidine and their monophosphate nucleotides from degration by neucleoside and nucleotide deaminases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c2","authors":["Drake, J C","Hande, K R","Fuller, R W","Chabner, B A"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-09T20:22:39+00:00","issns":["1873-2968"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1486671729,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20227960"],"pmid":"20227960","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminase inhibition by uridine analogs.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytidine-deoxycytidylate-deaminase-inhibition-uridine-analogs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":2070042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4993278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":265134,"mean":12.851816039497,"rank":92887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":167880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":265134,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2168,"mean":4.8431693585602,"rank":354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2168,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.9680952380952,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
