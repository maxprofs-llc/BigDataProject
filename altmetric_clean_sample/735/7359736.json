The portal blood flow and the oxygen consumption by PDV linearly increased at increased organic matter (OM) intake. No effect of level of OM intake was obtained for the hepatic artery blood flow and oxygen consumption by liver. As a consequence, the level of OM intake only tended to directly affect hepatic blood flow and oxygen consumption by total ST. Oxygen consumption was linearly and positively related to blood flow across PDV, liver and total ST. The heat production by PDV and total ST, as proportion of metabolizable energy (ME) intake, decreased curvilinearly at increased ME intake. In conclusion, the oxygen consumption by PDV, but not by liver, was directly related to the level of forage intake by sheep. Moreover, when ingested at levels below maintenance, most of ME was spent as heat produced by ST.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c85","authors":["Hentz, F","Kozloski, G V","Zeni, D","Brun, M V","Stefanello, S"],"doi":"10.1111\/jpn.12519","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T12:13:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-0396"],"journal":"Journal of Animal Physiology & Animal Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1463055197,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27166872?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27166872","pubdate":"2016-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["physiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Relationship between level of forage intake, blood flow and oxygen consumption by splanchnic tissues of sheep fed a tropical grass forage","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7690302,"mean":6.5973724521265,"rank":6653297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7690302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268158,"mean":11.428101462949,"rank":224061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268158,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":430,"mean":1.6287412587413,"rank":319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":430,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":0.67586206896552,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/730732577032536064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7359736],"posted_on":"2016-05-12T12:13:17+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"730732577032536064"}]}}
