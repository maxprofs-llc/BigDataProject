It is often necessary to use canine factor VIII (cFIII) gene or protein for the evaluation of HA treatment in the canine model. However, the different biological properties between cFVIII and human FVIII(hFVIII) indicated that the development of novel HA treatment may require careful characterization of non-human FVIII. To investigate whether the data obtained using cFVIII can translate to HA treatment in human, we analyzed the differential biological properties of canine heavy chain (cHC) and light chain (cLC) by comparing with human HC (hHC) and LC (hLC). The secretion of cHC was 5~30 fold higher than hHC, with or without LCs. cHC+hLC group exhibited ~18-fold increase in coagulation activity compared with hHC+hLC delivery by recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors. Unlike hHC, the secretion of cHC was independent of LCs. cLC improves the specific activity of FVIII by 2~3-fold compared with hLC. Moreover, the cLC but not cHC, contributes the high stability of cFVIII. Our results suggested that the cFVIII expression results in the canine model should be interpreted with caution as the cHC secreted more efficiently than hHC and cLC exhibited a more active and stable phenotype than hLC.Gene Therapy accepted article preview online, 11 April 2016. doi:10.1038\/gt.2016.34.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002934","authors":["Q Wang","B Dong","J Firrman","W Wu","S Roberts","A R Moore","L S Liu","M P S Chin","Y Diao","J Kost","W Xiao"],"doi":"10.1038\/gt.2016.34","first_seen_on":"2016-05-12T12:03:11+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1476-5462","0969-7128"],"journal":"Gene Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1463153713,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/gt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/gt201634a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/gt\/rss\/aop\/~3\/n2-rOxJ7PB4\/gt.2016.34"],"pmid":"27064790","pubdate":"2016-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Haematological diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Drug delivery","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Evaluation of the biological differences of canine and human factor VIII in gene delivery: implications in human hemophilia treatment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-biological-differences-canine-human-factor-viii-gene-delivery-implications-human-hemophil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7693543,"mean":6.6033207094937,"rank":780223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6907633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7693543,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268214,"mean":11.428456651989,"rank":40623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":227090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268214,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":6.8830504731861,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":12.464470588235,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
