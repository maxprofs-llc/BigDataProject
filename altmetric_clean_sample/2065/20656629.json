The WHO maternal near-miss criteria were modified for low-resource settings. The ratio of near-miss events to maternal deaths was calculated.\nAmong 122\u00a0707 women screened, 18\u00a0307 (15.0%) had a potential near-miss event, of whom 4866 (26.6%; 4.0% of all women) had a near-miss maternal event. The overall maternal mortality ratio was 155 per 100\u00a0000 live births. The ratio of near-miss events to maternal deaths was 26 to 1. The most common factors involved in near-miss cases were the hematologic\/coagulation system, infection, and cardiovascular system.\nBy using the Global Network Near-Miss Maternal Mortality System, large numbers of women were screened for near-miss events, including those delivering at home or a low-level maternity clinic. The 4.0% incidence of near-miss maternal mortality is similar to previously reported data. The ratio of 26 near-miss cases to 1 maternal death suggests that near miss might evaluate the impact of interventions more efficiently than maternal mortality.
