Interestingly, the Central domain encompasses one of the mutation hotspots (corresponding to amino acid residues 3778-4201) that contains a number of cardiac RyR (RyR2) mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the functional consequences of these Central domain RyR2 mutations are not well understood. To gain insights into the mutation impact and the role of the Central domain in channel function, we generated and characterized 8 disease-associated RyR2 mutations in the Central domain. We found that all 8 Central domain RyR2 mutations enhanced the Ca2+ dependent activation of [3H]ryanodine binding, increased cytosolic Ca2+ induced fractional Ca2+ release, and reduced the activation and termination thresholds for spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK293 cells. We also showed that racemic carvedilol and the non-beta-blocking carvedilol enantiomer, R-carvedilol, suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in HEK293 cells expressing the Central domain RyR2 mutations associated with CPVT and AF. These data indicate that the Central domain is an important determinant of cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2. These results also suggest that altered cytosolic Ca2+ activation of RyR2 represents a common defect of RyR2 mutations associated with CPVT and AF, which could potentially be suppressed by carvedilol or R-carvedilol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Zhichao Xiao","Wenting Guo","Bo Sun","Donald J.
