Epidemiological studies show that the incidence of inflammation-driven HCC in males is three times as high as in females. Recent studies suggest that sex hormones have a crucial role in the pathogenesis and development of HBV-induced HCC. We found that the estrogen\/androgen signaling pathway is associated with decreased\/increased transcription and replication of HBV genes and can promote the development of HBV infections by up\/downregulating HBV RNA transcription and inflammatory cytokines levels, which in turn slow down the progression of HBV-induced HCC. Additionally, sex hormones can also affect HBV-related HCC by inducing epigenetic changes. The evidence that both morphology and function of the human liver are affected by sex hormones was found over 60 years ago. However, the underlying molecular mechanism largely remains to be elucidated. This review focuses mainly on the molecular mechanisms behind the sex difference in HCC associated with HBV and other factors. In addition, several potential treatment and therapeutic strategies for inflammation-driven HCC will be introduced in this review.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000896","authors":["Zheng, Bo","Zhu, Yan-Jing","Wang, Hong-Yang","Chen, Lei"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11427-016-9043-9","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T17:04:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1674-7305","1869-1889"],"journal":"Science China Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1495891379,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28547581?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28547581","pubdate":"2017-05-27T22:04:01+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"Gender disparity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): multiple underlying mechanisms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-disparity-hepatocellular-carcinoma-hcc-multiple-underlying-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":5984409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1997693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238714,"mean":12.107982883211,"rank":154051,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238714,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":2.6009035812672,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.3354166666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
