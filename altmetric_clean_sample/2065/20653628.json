We first show that the selected level of theory is able to reproduce the structure and NMR spectra of all compounds. The aromaticity of these four macrocyclic entities are next quantified and it is showed that their bowl-shape induces a very strong aromatic character. Next we analyze the spectral signatures of all four compounds using an approach going beyond the vertical approximation. The 0-0 energies are reproduced with a mean absolute deviation smaller than 0.1 eV and the very good agreement obtained between experimental and theoretical band shapes allows us to unravel the vibronic contributions responsible to the specific band shapes of this subporphyrinoid. Finally, we investigate a large series of substituted subporphyrins, demonstrate the quality of the trends that are obtained with theory and design new compounds presenting redshifted optical bands.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Clo\u00e9 Azarias","Myl\u00e8ne Pawelek","Denis Jacquemin"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.7b03644","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T17:50:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-5639","1520-5215"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1495905736,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.7b03644"],"pmid":"28514149","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
