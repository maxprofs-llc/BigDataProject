However, the effects of digoxin in a mice model of inflammatory bowel disease have not been elucidated.\nColitis was induced in severe combined immunodeficiency mice by adoptive transfer of CD45RB CD4 T cells. Digoxin or a vehicle was injected into mice with colitis intraperitoneally every other day and changes in body weight were evaluated. After 6 to 8 weeks, the treated mice were killed and evaluated for histological score, T-cell subset, and cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the colonic tissue.\nWasting disease and histological damage were significantly attenuated in digoxin-treated mice with colitis compared with those in the vehicle-treated mice. In addition, the mRNAs of Th17-related cytokines were downregulated, whereas those of interleukin-10 were upregulated in the colonic mucosa of digoxin-treated mice. However, unexpectedly, the mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor alpha did not decrease in the colonic mucosa of digoxin-treated mice with colitis. This observation suggests that digoxin may ameliorate colitis by a tumor necrosis factor alpha-independent pathway.\nThis study has shown for the first time that treatment with digoxin can ameliorate murine experimental colitis. This finding suggests that the suppression of Th17 using reagents such as digoxin could be effective in treating Crohn's disease refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007774","authors":["Shinya Tani","Ryosuke Takano","Satoshi Tamura","Shinji Oishi","Moriya Iwaizumi","Yasushi Hamaya","Kosuke Takagaki","Toshi Nagata","Shintaro Seto","Toshinobu Horii","Isao Kosugi","Toshihide Iwashita","Satoshi Osawa","Takahisa Furuta","Hiroaki Miyajima","Ken Sugimoto"],"doi":"10.1097\/mib.0000000000001096","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T17:52:42+00:00","issns":["1078-0998"],"issue":"5","journal":"Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1495632500,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28426455"],"pmid":"28426455","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Digoxin Attenuates Murine Experimental Colitis by Downregulating Th17-related Cytokines","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":7144889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237878,"mean":12.089070620531,"rank":193007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237878,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1653,"mean":3.7291828087167,"rank":1427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1653,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":8.472676056338,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1446614405400959&id=316525948409816","license":"public","citation_ids":[20653908],"posted_on":"2017-05-24T13:28:20+00:00","summary":"\u3000\u8c37\u4f38\u4e5f\u5148\u751f\u306e\u8ad6\u6587\u304cInflammatory Bowel Diseases\u306bpublish\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01(https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28426455) \u3000\n\u3000Inflammatory Bowel Diseases\u8a8c\u306fIBD\u9818\u57df\u3067\u306f\u4e00\u5fdcmajor\u3067\u7acb\u6d3e\u306ajournal\u3067\u3059\uff08IF:4.358\uff09\u3002\n\u3000\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5168\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30b8\u30b4\u30ad\u30b7\u30f3\u306b\u306f\u708e\u75c7\u6027\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3042\u308bIL-17\u3092\u6291\u5236\u3059\u308b\u4f5c\u7528\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u8fd1\u5e74\u5831\u544a\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057IL-17\u3092\u30bf\u30fc\u30b2\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u3057\u305f\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7684\u88fd\u5264\u3067\u3042\u308b","author":{"name":"\u6d5c\u677e\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u6d88\u5316\u5668\u5185\u79d1","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/316525948409816","facebook_wall_name":"\u6d5c\u677e\u533b\u79d1\u5927\u5b66\u6d88\u5316\u5668\u5185\u79d1","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/316525948409816\/picture","id_on_source":"316525948409816"}}]}}
