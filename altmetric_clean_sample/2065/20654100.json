We confirmed that the production of the autoantibodies GFAP and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) was increased and inversely correlated with the concentration of secreted C peptide in female nonobese diabetic mice (T1DM model). Importantly, the development of T1DM in female nonobese diabetic mice at 30 wk of age was predicted by the positive GFAP autoantibody titer at 17 wk. The production of GFAP and GAD65 autoantibodies was also increased in KK-A(y) mice [type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model]. In patients with diabetes mellitus, GFAP autoantibody levels were increased in patients with either T1DM or T2DM, and were significantly associated with GAD65 autoantibodies but not zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies. Furthermore, we identified a B-cell epitope of GFAP corresponding to the GFAP autoantibody in both mice and diabetic patients. Thus, these results indicate that autoantibodies against GFAP could serve as a predictive marker for the development of overt autoimmune diabetes.-Pang, Z., Kushiyama, A., Sun, J., Kikuchi, T., Yamazaki, H., Iwamoto, Y., Koriyama, H., Yoshida, S., Shimamura, M., Higuchi, M., Kawano, T., Takami, Y., Rakugi, H., Morishita, R., Nakagumi, H. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a novel biomarker for the prediction of autoimmune diabetes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b3","authors":["Pang, Zhengda","Kushiyama, Akifumi","Sun, Jiao","Kikuchi, Takako","Yamazaki, Hiroki","Iwamoto, Yasuhiko","Koriyama, Hiroshi","Yoshida, Shota","Shimamura, Munehisa","Higuchi, Masayoshi","Kawano, Tomohiro","Takami, Yoichi","Rakugi, Hiromi","Morishita, Ryuichi","Nakagami, Hironori"],"doi":"10.1096\/fj.201700110r","first_seen_on":"2017-05-27T18:12:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0892-6638","1530-6860"],"journal":"FASEB Journal","last_mentioned_on":1496004992,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28546444?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28546444","pubdate":"2017-05-27T22:05:57+00:00","publisher":"FASEB","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a novel biomarker for the prediction of autoimmune diabetes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glial-fibrillary-acidic-protein-gfap-novel-biomarker-prediction-autoimmune-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":3917640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4180998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239027,"mean":12.11060282145,"rank":110389,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":121462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239027,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2784,"mean":11.038234998203,"rank":1516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2784,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":9.298265060241,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/868530263944343552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20654100],"posted_on":"2017-05-27T18:12:06+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
