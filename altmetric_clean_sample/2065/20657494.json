Factors that differed significantly between those with benign versus malignant pulmonary nodules were used to establish a prediction model for identifying malignant nodules.\nThe studied nodules were 51.3% malignant and 48.7% benign. Age, smoking status, nodule diameter, history of emphysema, vascular sign, burr sign, CYFRA21-1, CEA, miRNA-21-5p, and miRNA-574-5p differed significantly between the benign and malignant nodule groups. Serum levels of CYRFA21-1 and CEA could be used to distinguish between malignant and benign nodules with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80.0%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 84.2%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.863. Using the serum levels of miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-574-5p, the PPV was 55%, the NPV was 84.2%, and the AUC was 0.797. When all four serum markers were combined, the PPV was 80%, the NPV was 89.5%, and the AUC was 0.921. We established a prediction model for malignant nodules, including clinical features, imaging features, and serum markers. In cross-validation, the ratio of discriminant conformance was 95%.\nSerum levels of miRNA-21-5p and miRNA-574-5p are significantly higher in patients with malignant nodules than in patients with benign nodules and are potential serum biomarkers. Our prediction model could improve malignant nodule diagnosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","authors":["Li, Xianfeng","Zhang, Qinghua","Jin, Xiayun","Cao, Lihua","Xianfeng Li","Qinghua Zhang","Xiayun Jin","Lihua Cao"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12957-017-1171-y","first_seen_on":"2017-05-28T02:26:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1477-7819"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1495938364,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28545454?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28545454","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgical Oncology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Combining serum miRNAs, CEA, and CYFRA21-1 with imaging and clinical features to distinguish benign and malignant pulmonary nodules: a pilot study","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combining-serum-mirnas-cea-cyfra211-imaging-clinical-features-distinguish-benign-malignant-pulmonary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":7162727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239327,"mean":12.092299741775,"rank":194420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239327,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1238,"mean":1.3419110751819,"rank":1054,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1238,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/868654578404700160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20657494],"posted_on":"2017-05-28T02:26:04+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
