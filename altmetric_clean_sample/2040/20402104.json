(Hou)"],"citation":{"abstract":"Small-molecule compounds targeting trinucleotide repeats in DNA have considerable potential as therapeutic or diagnostic agents against many neurological diseases. NiII(Chro)2 (Chro = chromomycin A3) was found to bind specifically to the minor groove of (CCG)n repeats in duplex DNA, with unique fluorescence features that may serve as a probe for disease detection. Crystallographic studies have revealed that the specificity originates from the large-scale spatial rearrangement of the DNA structure, including extrusion of consecutive bases and backbone distortions, with a sharp bending of the duplex accompanied by conformational changes in the Ni(II) chelate itself. The DNA deformation of CCG repeats upon binding forms a GGCC tetranucleotide tract, which is recognized by NiII(Chro)2. The extruded cytosine and last guanine nucleotides form water-mediated hydrogen bonds which aid in ligand recognition. The recognition can be accounted for by the classic induced-fit paradigm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Tseng, Wen-Hsuan","Chang, Chung-Ke","Wu, Pei-Ching","Hu, Nien-Jen","Lee, Gene-Hsiang","Tzeng, Ching-Cherng","Neidle, Stephen","Hou, Ming-Hon","Tseng, Wen\u2010Hsuan","Chang, Chung\u2010ke","Wu, Pei\u2010Ching","Hu, Nien\u2010Jen","Lee, Gene\u2010Hsiang","Tzeng, Ching\u2010Cherng","Hou, Ming\u2010Hon"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201703989","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T09:00:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1521-3773","14337851"],"journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
