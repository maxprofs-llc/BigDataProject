Adults with sleep problems are at higher risk for musculoskeletal pain onset, but there is no evidence for this relationship in children and adolescents. This study aimed to systematically review prospective studies on the risk for musculoskeletal pain onset in children and adolescents with sleep problems.\nFive databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, EMBASE, HMIC) were systematically searched to identify prospective studies that investigated if children and adolescents (aged 6-19 years) with sleep problems are at higher risk for musculoskeletal pain onset. Included studies were assessed for study quality and a best evidence synthesis was carried out on extracted data.\nThirteen prospective studies were identified. Overall, evidence indicates that sleep problems (quality, quantity, day-time tiredness) are not risk factors for musculoskeletal pain onset. Further analysis on specific body regions show strong evidence that sleep problems are a risk factor for neck pain onset (only in girls), and strong evidence that sleep problems are not a risk factor for the onset of widespread pain.\nOverall sleep problems are not a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain onset in children and adolescents. Increased risk was found for some specific body regions and sub-groups but the evidence base was less strong and generally inconsistent. This review found a lack of quality in research methodology compared to research in adults and further research with improved methodology is required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894a","authors":["Andreucci, Alessandro","Campbell, Paul","Dunn, Kate M","Alessandro Andreucci","Paul Campbell","Kate M Dunn","Andreucci, MSc, Alessandro"],"doi":"10.1093\/sleep\/zsx093","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T09:22:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0161-8105","1550-9109"],"journal":"Sleep","last_mentioned_on":1502478076,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/sleep\/article-abstract\/doi\/10.1093\/sleep\/zsx093\/3836926\/Are-sleep-problems-a-risk-factor-for-the-onset-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28531332","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/sleep\/article\/3836926\/Are-Sleep-Problems-a-Risk-Factor-for-the-Onset-of"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/sleep\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/sleep\/zsx093\/17273117\/zsx093.pdf","pmid":"28531332","pubdate":"2017-05-23T18:51:42+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology"],"title":"Are sleep problems a risk factor for the onset of musculoskeletal pain in children and adolescents?
