The Pseudomonas psychrotolerans strain PRS08-11306 was isolated from rice seeds and can enhance plant growth. Here, we analyzed the P. psychrotolerans genome, which is \u223c5Mb, with 4389 coding sequences, 77 tRNAs, and 7 rRNAs. Genome analysis identified a cluster of turnerbactin biosynthetic genes, which are responsible for the production of a catecholate siderophore and contribute to nitrogen fixation for the host. Analysis of the transcription factor mutant \u0394rpoS, which does not express this gene cluster, confirmed the relationship between the gene cluster and siderophore production. The nitrogen fixation characteristics of the cluster were confirmed in a plant growth-promoting experiment. The annotated full genome sequence of this strain sheds light on the role of P. psychrotolerans PRS08-11306 as a plant beneficial bacterium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Ruifang Liu","Yu Zhang","Ping Chen","Haiyan Lin","Guoyou Ye","Zhongwei Wang","Changwei Ge","Bo Zhu","Deyong Ren"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2017.05.012","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T10:19:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["01681656","1873-4863"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1495563726,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28528782?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28528782","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Genomic and phenotypic analyses of Pseudomonas psychrotolerans PRS08-11306 reveal a turnerbactin biosynthesis gene cluster that contributes to nitrogen fixation","type":"article","volume":"253","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomic-phenotypic-analyses-pseudomonas-psychrotolerans-prs0811306-reveal-turnerbactin-biosynthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":4149605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3894566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237279,"mean":12.123780906784,"rank":118755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237279,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1008,"mean":3.1953088381331,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1008,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.41832,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
