To determine the serum prealbumin (PA), retinol binding protein (RBP), and retinol levels in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and to analyze some factors related to those levels. Methods. A total of 93 patients (47 women) were studied. Age, gender, BMI, duration of diabetes, chronic complications, HbA1c, lipid profile, creatinine, albumin, PA, RBP, and retinol were recorded. High and low parameter groups were compared by Mann-Whitney U and \u03c7(2) tests. Correlation between parameters was analyzed by Spearman's test. Odds of low levels were analyzed by univariate logistic regression and included in the multivariate analysis when significant. Results. 49.5%, 48.4%, and 30.1% of patients displayed serum PA, RBP, and retinol levels below normal values, respectively. A high correlation (Rho > 0.8) between PA, RBP, and retinol serum levels was found. Patients presenting low levels of any of them were predominantly women, normal-weighted, and with lower levels of triglycerides and serum creatinine. No differences in age, macrovascular complications, duration of diabetes, or HbA1c values were observed when comparing low and normal parameter groups. Conclusion. Low serum levels of PA, RBP, and retinol are frequent in T1D adult patients. This alteration is influenced by female sex and serum creatinine and triglyceride levels.","altmetric_jid":"56b367f82a83eea9718b4799","authors":["Luis Forga","Federico Bolado","Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Go\u00f1i","Ibai Tamayo","Berta Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez","Carlos Prieto"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/2532108","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T13:23:25+00:00","issns":["2314-6745","2314-6753"],"journal":"Journal of Diabetes Research","last_mentioned_on":1495543624,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28018921?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5153501","pmid":"28018921","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Low Serum Levels of Prealbumin, Retinol Binding Protein, and Retinol Are Frequent in Adult Type 1 Diabetic Patients","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-serum-levels-prealbumin-retinol-binding-protein-retinol-frequent-adult-type-1-diabetic-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7140000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237280,"mean":12.123782703062,"rank":192377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":441,"mean":3.8787136363636,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":441,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.4583333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
