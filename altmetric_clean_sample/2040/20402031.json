Participants underwent microperimetry using a test pattern (37 point, 5\u00b0 radius) centered on their mPRL. Sensitivities were compared to normative data by spatial interpolation, and conventional perimetric indices were calculated. The location of the mPRL relative to the fovea and to visual field defects was also investigated.\nLocation of mPRL varied approximately 15\u00b0 horizontally and vertically. Visual field loss within 5\u00b0 of the mPRL was considerable in the majority of participants (median mean deviation -14.7 dB, interquartile range [IQR] -19.6 to -9.6 dB, median pattern standard deviation 7.1 dB [IQR 4.8-9.0 dB]). Over 95% of participants had mean total deviation worse than -2 dB across all tested locations and similarly within 1\u00b0 of their mPRL. A common pattern of placing the mPRL just foveal to a region of normal pattern deviation was found in 78% of participants. Total deviation was outside normal limits in this region in 68%.\nDespite altering fixation to improve vision, people with AMD exhibit considerable visual field loss at and around their mPRL. The location of the mPRL was typically just foveal to, but not within, a region of relatively normal sensitivity for the individual, suggesting that a combination of factors drives mPRL selection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["Jonathan Denniss","Helen C.
