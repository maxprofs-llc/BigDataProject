However, although much attention has been given to acute malaria infections, relatively little attention has been paid to asymptomatic malaria. Nonetheless, because the asymptomatic host serves as a reservoir for the malaria parasite, asymptomatic malaria is now recognized as an important obstacle to malaria elimination. Asymptomatic malaria is also associated with anaemia, a global public health problem with serious consequences on human health as well as social and economic development. In Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), malaria, anaemia, and malnutrition are serious public health concerns. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between these variables. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between asymptomatic malaria, growth status, and the prevalence of anaemia among children aged 120\u00a0months old or younger in rural villages in Lao PDR.\nIn December 2010 and March 2011, data were collected from five villages in Savannakhet province. Anthropometric measurements, blood samples, and malaria rapid diagnostic tests were conducted. The presence of malaria was confirmed with polymerase chain reaction assays for Plasmodium falciparum. Underweight status, stunting, and anaemia were defined according to World Health Organization standards.\nThe mean age of participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0319) was 88.3\u00a0months old (Standard Deviation: 20.6, ranged from 30-119\u00a0months old), and 20 participants (6.3\u00a0%) had an asymptomatic malaria infection, 92 (28.8\u00a0%) were anaemic, 123 (38.6\u00a0%) were underweight, and 137 (42.9\u00a0%) were stunted. Stunted children were more likely to be infected with asymptomatic malaria [odds ratio (OR) 3.34, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-8.93], and asymptomatic malaria was associated with anaemia [OR 5.17, 95\u00a0% CI 1.99-13.43].\nThese results suggest a significant association between asymptomatic malaria and anaemia in children. Furthermore, stunted children were more likely to have lower Hb levels and to be infected with asymptomatic malaria than children without stunting. However, further studies examining the impact of asymptomatic malaria infection on children's nutritional and development status are necessary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Takeshi Akiyama","Tiengkham Pongvongsa","Souraxay Phrommala","Tomoyo Taniguchi","Yuba Inamine","Rie Takeuchi","Tadashi Watanabe","Futoshi Nishimoto","Kazuhiko Moji","Shigeyuki Kano","Hisami Watanabe","Jun Kobayashi"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12936-016-1548-3","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T10:03:49+00:00","issns":["1475-2875"],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1495533801,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27756399?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27756399","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Asymptomatic malaria, growth status, and anaemia among children in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: a cross-sectional study","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asymptomatic-malaria-growth-status-anaemia-among-children-lao-peoples-democratic-republic-crosssecti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237280,"mean":12.123804196747,"rank":192374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237280,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2915,"mean":4.9489238160604,"rank":2641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2915,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":5.4051094890511,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
