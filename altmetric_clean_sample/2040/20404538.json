Standard approaches (using Laplace smoothing and total variation regularization) without prior structural information are unable to accurately reconstruct or detect the tumors. The soft-prior approach represents a very significant improvement to these standard approaches, and has the potential to improve conventional imaging techniques, such as automated whole breast ultrasound (AWB-US), by providing electrical property information of suspicious lesions to improve AWB-US's ability to discriminate benign from cancerous lesions.\nSpecifically, the best soft-regularization technique found average absolute tumor\/inclusion errors of 0.015 S m(-1) for the cylindrical test and 0.055 S m(-1) and 0.080 S m(-1) for the breast-shaped tank for 1.8\u2009cm and 2.5\u2009cm inclusions, respectively. The standard approaches were statistically unable to distinguish the tumor from the mammary gland tissue. An analysis of false tumors (benign suspicious lesions) provides extra insight into the potential and challenges EIT has for providing clinically relevant information.\nThe ability to obtain accurate conductivity values of a suspicious lesion (>1.8\u2009cm) detected from another modality (e.g. AWB-US) could significantly reduce false positives and result in a clinically important technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003323","authors":["Murphy, Ethan K","Mahara, Aditya","Wu, Xiaotian","Halter, Ryan J"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6579\/aa691b","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T10:05:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0967-3334","1361-6579"],"issue":"6","journal":"Physiological Measurement","last_mentioned_on":1495533850,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28530205?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28530205","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biomedicalengineering","physiology"],"title":"Phantom experiments using soft-prior regularization EIT for breast cancer imaging","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phantom-experiments-using-softprior-regularization-eit-breast-cancer-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":7139994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237279,"mean":12.123856767167,"rank":192374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237279,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":2.8124709302326,"rank":279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":11.03,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
