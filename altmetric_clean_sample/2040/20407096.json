Multiple factors, including psychosocial, genetic, and neurobiological determinants modulate the liability to both aggressive behavior and mental illness. Concerning the latter factors, multiple lines of evidence have shown a dysfunction in the serotonin (5-HT) system occurring in aggressive and in mentally ill individuals. In particular, a reduced 5-HT activity has been associated with depression as well as with aggressive behavior, especially with impulsive aggression. Consistently, psychopharmacological interventions aimed at boosting the 5-HT system (e.g. with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a high percentage of patients with either or both pathological conditions. Current knowledge does not yet allow to clearly disentangle whether 5-HT dysfunction, most often a 5-HT deficiency, is the consequence of the aggressive\/violent behavior, of the underlying mental disease\/s, or the expression of the comorbidity. Future studies are thus needed to clarify the association between changes in 5-HT levels, altered activity of 5-HT receptors and their intracellular signaling cascades, and modifications of 5-HT genes, and in particular the neurobiological link between the altered 5-HT machinery and aggressive behavior in the context or in the absence of mental illness. In this review, we employ a dimensional approach to discuss the trivariate relationship among the 5-HT system, aggressive behaviour, and mental illness, focusing our attention on 5-HT levels, 5-HT receptors, metabolic enzymes and their genes. Emphasis is given to controversial findings, still unanswered questions, and future perspectives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006812","authors":["Mirko Manchia","Bernardo Carpiniello","Flavia Valtorta","Stefano Comai"],"doi":"10.1021\/acschemneuro.6b00427","first_seen_on":"2017-05-23T11:24:17+00:00","issns":["1948-7193"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1495561908,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28378993"],"pmid":"28378993","pubdate":"2017-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Serotonin Dysfunction, Aggressive Behavior, and Mental Illness: Exploring the Link Using a Dimensional Approach","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serotonin-dysfunction-aggressive-behavior-mental-illness-exploring-link-using-dimensional-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8255097,"mean":6.9732502228862,"rank":5969468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1991574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8255097,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237279,"mean":12.123781328231,"rank":152781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237279,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":674,"mean":7.4871738484398,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":674,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":3.712,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
