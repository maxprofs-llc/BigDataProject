Total dietary fiber contents of WFB and FBSC were 27.5% and 82.3%, respectively. FBSC were contained much higher total phenolic substances, condensed tannins, and total antioxidant activity than WFB. Bile acid (BA)-binding capacities of in vitro digested samples and nutritionally important products produced by in vitro fermentation of digestion residues were also studied. The BA-binding capacities of WFB and FBSC were 1.94 and 37.50\u03bcmol\/100mg, respectively. Total BA bound by FBSC was even higher than the positive standard cholestyramine. Lignin and other constituents of the Klason residue were found to influence BA-binding properties. Moreover, the extent of the in vitro fermentation process showed that, fermentability of FBSC residue was significantly lower than that of WFB residue. Overall, faba bean, especially its seed coat, has great potential as a functional food.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f5","authors":["Selen \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkant\u00fcrk Karata\u015f","Demet G\u00fcnay","Sedat Sayar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.foodchem.2017.03.037","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T15:31:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03088146","0308-8146"],"journal":"Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1492011055,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0308814617304028"],"pmid":"28407899","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"In vitro evaluation of whole faba bean and its seed coat as a potential source of functional food components","type":"article","volume":"230","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitro-evaluation-whole-faba-bean-seed-coat-potential-source-functional-food-components-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":6124777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1081444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237174,"mean":12.880268133388,"rank":168376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237174,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":3.8673594029851,"rank":1919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":4.7337592592593,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
