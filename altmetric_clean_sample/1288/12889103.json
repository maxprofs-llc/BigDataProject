Patients were recruited if they were undergoing one of the following procedures as part of normal care: turning, personal hygiene care, transfer from bed to chair, bladder catheterization, pressure ulcer care, and subcutaneous drug administration. The Numerical Rating Scale was used to measure pain intensity before, during, and after the procedure.\nOne thousand seventy-nine eligible patients were enrolled; 49.7% were male and their mean age was 78.0\u00b111.2 years. Of all patients, 20.9% had experienced a BTP episode within the 24 hours prior to recruitment. The overall prevalence of procedure-induced BTP was 11.8%, and the mean intensity score (Numeric Rating Scale) was 4.72\u00b11.81. Notably, patients experienced a significant increase in pain intensity during all procedures (P<0.0001). A small proportion of patients (12.7%) received analgesics before undergoing any of the procedures, and almost none (1.7%) received analgesics during the procedures to alleviate acute pain.\nOur findings highlight that simple daily care procedures can lead to BTP among patients with advanced disease. Because such procedures are performed so often during palliative care, more individualized attention to procedural pain control is necessary. Further research on procedural pain in patients with advanced disease should be encouraged to provide further evidence-based guidance on the use of the available medication for predictable pain flares.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057ff","authors":["Magnani, Caterina","Giannarelli, Diana","Casale, Giuseppe"],"doi":"10.1097\/ajp.0000000000000450","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T16:36:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0749-8047","1536-5409"],"journal":"Clinical journal of pain","last_mentioned_on":1477156914,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Procedural_Pain_in_Palliative_Care__Is_It.99099.aspx","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/9000\/00000\/Procedural_Pain_in_Palliative_Care__Is_It.99099.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/9000\/00000\/Procedural_Pain_in_Palliative_Care__Is_It.99099.pdf","pmid":"27768607","pubdate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Procedural Pain in Palliative Care","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Procedural_Pain_in_Palliative_Care__Is_It.99099.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/procedural-pain-palliative-care-it-breakthrough-pain-multicenter-national-prospective-study-assess-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":3697091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3688480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236516,"mean":12.570833511616,"rank":119674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236516,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1291,"mean":5.4659426356589,"rank":738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1291,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.1,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinJrnlPain\/statuses\/789867892791619584","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12889103],"posted_on":"2016-10-22T16:35:55+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinicalJrnlPain","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalpain.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000026493711\/0c8e1964c5af495bdd6050bcbc114e30_normal.jpeg","description":"The Clinical Journal of Pain explores pain and its effective treatment, bringing the insights of anesthesiologists, surgeons, internists, and neurologists.","id_on_source":"ClinJrnlPain","tweeter_id":"343396100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":263},"tweet_id":"789867892791619584"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Ze_Beps\/statuses\/789879465392365568","license":"gnip","rt":["ClinJrnlPain"],"citation_ids":[12889103],"posted_on":"2016-10-22T17:21:54+00:00","author":{"name":"\u266b Ze Beps, MD \u266b","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452374271999102976\/HriG_iDi_normal.jpeg","description":"\u266b l'importante \u00e8 non illudersi mai di essere interessanti. \u266b","id_on_source":"Ze_Beps","tweeter_id":"14494559","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":280},"tweet_id":"789879465392365568"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Procedural Pain in Palliative Care: Is It Breakthrough Pain?
