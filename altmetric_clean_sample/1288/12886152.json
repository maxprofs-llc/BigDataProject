We now report that bacteria supersede both of these controls when experiencing low cytosolic magnesium (Mg(2+)), a divalent cation essential for ribosome stabilization and for neutralization of ATP's negative charge. We uncover a regulatory circuit that responds to low cytosolic Mg(2+) by promoting expression of proteins that import Mg(2+) and lower ATP amounts. This response reduces the levels of ATP and ribosomes, making Mg(2+) ions available for translation. Mutants defective in Mg(2+) uptake and unable to reduce ATP levels accumulate non-functional ribosomal components and undergo translational arrest. Our findings establish a paradigm whereby cells reduce the amounts of translating ribosomes to carry out protein synthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Pontes, Mauricio H","Yeom, Jinki","Groisman, Eduardo A","Mauricio\u00a0H.
