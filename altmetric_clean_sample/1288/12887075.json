We review the clinically relevant application of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics to drugs and conditions encountered in the ICU.\nWe selected relevant literature to illustrate the important concepts contained within.\nTwo main approaches have been used to identify genetic abnormalities - the candidate gene approach and the genome-wide approach. Genetic variability in response to drugs may occur as a result of alterations of drug-metabolizing (cytochrome P [CYP]) enzymes, receptors, and transport proteins leading to enhancement or delay in the therapeutic response. Of relevance to the ICU, genetic variation in CYP-450 isoenzymes results in altered effects of midazolam, fentanyl, morphine, codeine, phenytoin, clopidogrel, warfarin, carvedilol, metoprolol, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, proton pump inhibitors, and ondansetron. Changes in cholinesterase enzyme function may affect the disposition of succinylcholine, benzylisoquinoline muscle relaxants, remifentanil, and hydralazine. Genetic variation in transport proteins leads to differences in the response to opioids and clopidogrel. Polymorphisms in drug receptors result in altered effects of \u03b2-blockers, catecholamines, antipsychotic agents, and opioids. Genetic variation also contributes to the diversity and incidence of diseases and conditions such as sepsis, malignant hyperthermia, drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac channelopathies, thromboembolic disease, and congestive heart failure.\nApplication of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics has seen improvements in drug therapy. Ongoing study and incorporation of these concepts into clinical decision making in the ICU has the potential to affect patient outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006dac","authors":["Meghan MacKenzie","Richard Hall"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12630-016-0748-1","first_seen_on":"2016-10-22T15:04:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1496-8975"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1477148643,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12630-016-0748-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12630-016-0748-1.pdf","pmid":"27752976","pubdate":"2016-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics for the intensive care unit: a narrative review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacogenomics-pharmacogenetics-intensive-care-unit-narrative-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":5735183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1016079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236516,"mean":12.570854017715,"rank":164312,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236516,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1110,"mean":3.6450441839495,"rank":764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1110,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.92875,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
