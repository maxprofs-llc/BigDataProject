Refinement may be a multistage process akin to fractional distillation; the stack of cisternae comprising the cis Golgi may be the plates in this distillation tower. The trans Golgi, consisting of the last one or two cisternae, may be the receiver that collects from the cis Golgi only its most refined fraction for later distribution to specific locations throughout the cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1981Sci...213.1212R","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["JE Rothman"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.7268428","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T08:22:13+00:00","issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1229114517,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.7268428","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7268428"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/213\/4513\/1212.full.pdf","pmid":"7268428","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The golgi apparatus: two organelles in tandem.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/golgi-apparatus-two-organelles-tandem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94927,"mean":8.0768211659611,"rank":24717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94927,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27894,"mean":20.994401319328,"rank":15043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":7299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27894,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":91.057339920949,"rank":442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
