Differences in alcoholism rates exist between these two ethnic groups, and researchers have investigated whether these differences can be explained in part by variations in the genes encoding the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 1B and 1C, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1 and 2. Studies have demonstrated that a certain variant of the gene encoding ADH1B (ADH1B*3) is associated with a reduced risk of alcoholism in Afro-Trinidadians, as is a variant of the gene encoding ADH1C (i.e., ADH1C*1) in Indo-Trinidadians. An ALDH2 variant shown to have protective effects primarily in East Asians was not found in either Trinidadian ethnic group. However, a variant in the gene encoding cytosolic ALDH1A (i.e. ALDH1A1*1\/*2) was found to be associated with an increase in alcohol dependence in Indo-Trinidadians.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c9","authors":["Moore S","Montane-Jaime LK","Carr LG","Ehlers CL"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T15:21:35+00:00","issns":["1535-7414"],"issue":"1","journal":"Alcohol Research & Health","last_mentioned_on":1270756752,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17718398","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17718398"],"pmid":"17718398","pubdate":"2007-08-28T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in people of East Indian and African descent from Trinidad and Tobago.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variations-alcoholmetabolizing-enzymes-people-east-indian-african-descent-trinidad-tobago"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546592,"mean":6.5174487601049,"rank":1824526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4714454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546592,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235510,"mean":7.9575212751955,"rank":65686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":165190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235510,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":7.0425405405405,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
