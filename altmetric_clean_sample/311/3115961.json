In total, 272 out of 534 RaK2 ORFs lack detectable database homologues. Based on the similarity to biologically defined proteins and\/or MS\/MS analysis, 117 of RaK2 ORFs were given a functional annotation, including 28 RaK2 ORFs coding for structural proteins that have no reliable homologues to annotated structural proteins in other organisms. The electron micrographs revealed elaborate spike-like structures on the tail fibers of Rak2, suggesting that this phage is an atypical myovirus. While head and tail proteins of RaK2 are mostly myoviridae-related, the bioinformatics analysis indicate that tail fibers\/spikes of this phage are formed from podovirus-like peptides predominantly. Overall, these results provide evidence that bacteriophage RaK2 differs profoundly from previously studied viruses of the Myoviridae family.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Eugenijus \u0160imoli\u016bnas","Laura Kaliniene","Lidija Truncait\u0117","Aurelija Zajan\u010dkauskait\u0117","Juozas Staniulis","Algirdas Kaupinis","Marija Ger","Mindaugas Valius","Rolandas Me\u0161kys"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0060717","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T20:46:24+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1397647876,"links":["http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0060717","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0060717","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23593293","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3622015"],"pmid":"23593293","pubdate":"2013-04-09T07:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e60717","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Klebsiella Phage vB_KleM-RaK2 \u2014 A Giant Singleton Virus of the Family Myoviridae","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/klebsiella-phage-vbklemrak2-giant-singleton-virus-family-myoviridae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3665200,"mean":4.9483382724962,"rank":827889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2313877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3665200,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98766,"mean":8.4208455019491,"rank":26871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":70766,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98766,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64601,"mean":8.2931349226006,"rank":19164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":44092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64601,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1806,"mean":10.542240443213,"rank":563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1806,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
