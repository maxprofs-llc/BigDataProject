In GEPR-3s, audiogenic kindling results in facial and forelimb (F&F) clonic seizures that are typical of forebrain seizures. However, in GEPR-9s, audiogenic kindling produces posttonic all-limb clonus not usually observed during forebrain seizures. We hypothesized that the more severe brainstem seizures of the GEPR-9 prevent the expression of F&F clonic seizures during audiogenic kindling. Therefore attenuation of audiogenic seizures during audiogenic kindling in GEPR-9s should allow F&F clonic seizures to be expressed. Likewise, intensifying audiogenic seizure severity in GEPR-3s should inhibit audiogenically kindled F&F clonic seizures. We have tested this hypothesis in the present study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["Merrill, Michelle A.","Clough, Richard W.","Jobe, Phillip C.","Browning, Ronald A.","Merrill MA","Clough RW","Jobe PC","Browning RA"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2005.39404.x","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T18:58:03+00:00","issns":["1528-1167","0013-9580"],"issue":"9","journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1468200473,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2005.39404.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16146432"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2005.39404.x\/pdf","pmid":"16146432","pubdate":"2005-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Science Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"Brainstem seizure severity regulates forebrain seizure expression in the audiogenic kindling model.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brainstem-seizure-severity-regulates-forebrain-seizure-expression-audiogenic-kindling-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063512,"mean":6.842512696265,"rank":2025865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4926198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063512,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239571,"mean":8.1485410026298,"rank":68066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239571,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2755,"mean":5.4459121278141,"rank":896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2755,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":6.1414029850746,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
