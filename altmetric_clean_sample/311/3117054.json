In this work, we report an effective solvothermal method for the direct preparation of 3D Pt-Co nanowire assemblies (NWAs) with tunable composition. The composition- and structure-dependent electrocatalytic performance is thoroughly investigated. Because of the bimetallic synergetic effect and unique structural advantage, the as-prepared 3D Pt3 Co NWA outperforms commercial Pt\/carbon and Pt black catalysts and even 3D Pt NWA. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the 3D Pt3 Co NWA is indeed a promising electrocatalyst with enhanced catalytic activity and improved durability for practical electrocatalytic applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Xia, Bao Yu","Wu, Hao Bin","Li, Nan","Yan, Ya","Lou, Xiong Wen (David)","Wang, Xin"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201411544","endpage":"3801","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T23:51:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3773","1433-7851"],"issue":"12","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
