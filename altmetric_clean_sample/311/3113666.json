First, it highlights the primary role that recipient, rather than donor, DCs have in rejection and reviews their origin and function in the transplanted kidney. Second, it introduces the novel concept that recognition of allogeneic non-self by host monocytes (referred to here as innate allorecognition) is necessary for initiating rejection by inducing monocyte differentiation into mature, antigen-presenting DCs. Both concepts provide opportunities for preventing rejection by targeting monocytes or DCs.Kidney International advance online publication, 28 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/ki.2014.430.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Quan Zhuang","Fadi G Lakkis"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2014.430","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T17:20:07+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["0085-2538"," 1523-1755","1523-1755"],"journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1455823507,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ki.2014.430","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ki\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ki2014430a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25629552?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ki\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ki2014430a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ki\/rss\/aop\/~3\/21yUvuB8rU0\/ki.2014.430"],"pmid":"25629552","pubdate":"2015-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Dendritic cells and innate immunity in kidney transplantation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dendritic-cells-innate-immunity-kidney-transplantation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":562619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6638570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233176,"mean":7.8990462785463,"rank":24016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":208887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233176,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2295,"mean":4.1401717523976,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2295,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":10.463545454545,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
