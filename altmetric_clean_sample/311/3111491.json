Significant different transition state structures are obtained for the hydrolysis of both antibiotics: while the TS of the CEF is a ionic species with negative charge on nitrogen, the IMI TS presents a tetrahedral-like character with negative charge on oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of the lactam ring. Thus, dramatic conformational changes can take place in the cavity of CphA to accommodate different substrates, which would be the origin of its substrate promiscuity. Since CphA shows only activity against carbapenem antibiotic, this study sheds some light into the origin of the selectivity of the different MbL and, as a consequence, into the discovery of specific and potent M\u03b2L inhibitors against a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens. We have finally probed that a re-parametrization of semiempirical methods should be done to properly describe the behavior the metal cation in active site, Zn(2+), when used in QM\/MM calculations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","authors":["C Meli\u00e1","S Ferrer","V Moliner","J Bertr\u00e1n"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.abb.2015.01.013","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T11:14:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-0384","00039861"],"journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1423133258,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25622886?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25622886?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0003986115000363"],"pmid":"25622886","pubdate":"2015-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Theoretical studies of the hydrolysis of antibiotics catalyzed by a metallo-\u03b2-lactamase ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/theoretical-studies-hydrolysis-antibiotics-catalyzed-metallolactamase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4720494,"mean":5.6985437665106,"rank":2104960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2564443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4720494,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164068,"mean":8.6447376986235,"rank":66885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":94546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164068,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1571,"mean":2.7462267515924,"rank":1238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1571,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":3.5807567567568,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
