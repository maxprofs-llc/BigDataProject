Once humans are exposed to Cd(2+) on a chronic basis, Cd(2+) primarily accumulates in the liver and kidney where it forms complexes with small peptides and proteins via sulfhydryl groups. Complexed Cd(2+) or the ionic Cd(2+) is then taken up by target cells and tissues and exerts the toxicity. However, the question of how non-essential Cd(2+) crosses the cell membranes remains unanswered. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of Cd(2+)-induced physiological signaling disruption in cells is still not fully elucidated. Investigations of Cd(2+) uptake kinetics, distributions, and concentrations in cells require chemical tools for its detection. Because of the easy use and high spatiotemporal resolution, optical imaging using fluorescence microscopy is a well-suited method for monitoring Cd(2+) in biological samples. This chapter summarizes design principles of small molecule fluorescent sensors for Cd(2+) detection in aqueous solution and their photophysical and metal-binding properties. Also the applications of probes for fluorescence imaging of Cd(2+) in a variety of cell types are demonstrated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca9","authors":["Masayasu Taki"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-94-007-5179-8_5","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T18:42:16+00:00","issns":["1559-0836"],"journal":"Metal ions in life sciences","last_mentioned_on":1367139205,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/978-94-007-5179-8_5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2F978-94-007-5179-8_5.pdf","pmid":"23430772","pubdate":"2016-02-13T20:13:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Science, general","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Imaging and Sensing of Cadmium in Cells","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-sensing-cadmium-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
