A cross-sectional two-part survey of trauma centers was conducted. Part 1 determined demographic information and videotaping status. Part 2 asked trauma centers that were not doing videotaping (NVTCs) about their plans, past experience, and perceived problems. Videotaping trauma centers (VTCs) were asked about mechanics, responsibility, utilization, and problems. A total of 221 centers were surveyed; 20% VTCs, 70% NVTCs, and 10% NVTCs that had videotaped in the past (PVTC). Among VTCs, 53% reported problems with videotaping including lack of personnel (40%) and time (40%) to administer the program. Videotaping, however, was found to be an effective quality improvement tool in 95% of the VTCs. Of the NVTCs, 70% perceived problems with implementing a videotaping program; these included medicolegal (34%) and patient confidentiality (22%) concerns. Of the PVTCs, 90% stated that they had problems with videotaping including lack of staff support (33%) and lack of personnel to assist with the program (24%). In conclusion, staff participation and adequate personnel outweigh medicolegal concerns as actual videotaping problems. Videotaping is perceived to be an effective performance improvement tool.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["D G Ellis","E B Lerner","D V Jehle","K Romano","C Siffring"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T07:14:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0736-4679"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1422370980,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10431947"],"pmid":"10431947","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"A multi-state survey of videotaping practices for major trauma resuscitations.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multistate-survey-videotaping-practices-major-trauma-resuscitations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4669204,"mean":5.6775783798666,"rank":848836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3800424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4669204,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162145,"mean":8.7444327758044,"rank":35857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":125844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162145,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1283,"mean":5.2578751950078,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1283,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":7.6731333333333,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Doctor GoPro and Nurse Microsoft Hololens meet Patient Google Glass:  How are we still not videotaping PED care?","url":"http:\/\/www.pemfellows.com\/blog\/doctor-gopro-and-nurse-microsoft-hololens-meet-patient-google-glass-videotaping-ped-care\/","citation_ids":[3119004,3119005,2938734,659187],"posted_on":"2015-01-27T15:03:00+00:00","summary":"Will the day come that a patient coming in with Googleglass is cared for by a doctor wearing a GoPros and a nurse with a Microsoft Hololens?
