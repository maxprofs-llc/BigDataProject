Here, we report the development and validation of stabilized alpha helices of son of sevenless 1 (SAH-SOS1) as prototype therapeutics that directly inhibit wild-type and mutant forms of KRAS. SAH-SOS1 peptides bound in a sequence-specific manner to KRAS and its mutants, and dose-responsively blocked nucleotide association. Importantly, this functional binding activity correlated with SAH-SOS1 cytotoxicity in cancer cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of KRAS. The mechanism of action of SAH-SOS1 peptides was demonstrated by sequence-specific down-regulation of the ERK-MAP kinase phosphosignaling cascade in KRAS-driven cancer cells and in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Ras85D(V12) activation. These studies provide evidence for the potential utility of SAH-SOS1 peptides in neutralizing oncogenic KRAS in human cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Elizaveta S Leshchiner","Andrey Parkhitko","Gregory H Bird","James Luccarelli","Joseph A Bellairs","Silvia Escudero","Kwadwo Opoku-Nsiah","Marina Godes","Norbert Perrimon","Loren D Walensky","Leshchiner ES","Parkhitko A","Bird GH","Luccarelli J","Bellairs JA","Escudero S","Opoku-Nsiah K","Godes M","Perrimon N","Walensky LD"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.1413185112","endpage":"1766","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T11:44:23+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","nci"],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"6","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1422453443,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25624485?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25624485","pubdate":"2015-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"1761","subjects":["science"],"title":"Direct inhibition of oncogenic KRAS by hydrocarbon-stapled SOS1 helices.","type":"article","volume":"112","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-inhibition-oncogenic-kras-hydrocarbonstapled-sos1-helices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4689255,"mean":5.7073978210593,"rank":3142041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1363594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4689255,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162216,"mean":8.7393097679009,"rank":105403,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":49566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162216,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36792,"mean":17.523316843793,"rank":33071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":3205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36792,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":966,"mean":43.535985492228,"rank":831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":966,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":25,"Student  > Ph.
