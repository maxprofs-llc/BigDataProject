Even though biological pathways have been studied extensively, discovering missing genes in pathways remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present an easy-to-use tool that allows users to run MORPH (MOdule-guided Ranking of candidate PatHway genes), an algorithm for revealing missing genes in biological pathways, and demonstrate its capabilities. MORPH supports the analysis in tomato, Arabidopsis, and the two new species: rice and the newly sequenced potato genome. The new tool, called MORPH-R, is available both as a web server (at http:\/\/bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be\/webtools\/morph\/) and as standalone software that can be used locally. In the standalone version, the user can apply the tool to new organisms using any proprietary and public data sources.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000331e","authors":["David Amar","Itziar Frades","Tim Diels","David Zaltzman","Netanel Ghatan","Pete E Hedley","Erik Alexandersson","Oren Tzfadia","Ron Shamir","Amar D","Frades I","Diels T","Zaltzman D","Ghatan N","Hedley PE","Alexandersson E","Tzfadia O","Shamir R","Amar, David","Frades, Itziar","Diels, Tim","Zaltzman, David","Ghatan, Netanel","Hedley, Pete E.","Alexandersson, Erik","Tzfadia, Oren","Shamir, Ron"],"doi":"10.1111\/ppl.12326","endpage":"20","first_seen_on":"2015-01-28T16:58:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"1854\/LU-7026678","handles":["1854\/LU-7026678"],"issns":["1399-3054","0031-9317","00319317"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physiologia Plantarum","last_mentioned_on":1422464290,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25625434?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1111\/ppl.12326"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ppl.12326\/pdf","pmid":"25625434","pubdate":"2015-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Horticultural Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"12","subjects":["botany"],"title":"The MORPH-R web server and software tool for predicting missing genes in biological pathways.","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/morphr-web-server-software-tool-predicting-missing-genes-biological-pathways"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4683775,"mean":5.7027612822493,"rank":2492363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1554087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4683775,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161599,"mean":8.7582675775692,"rank":84937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":56708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161599,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":352,"mean":1.4138233618234,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":352,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.8,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
