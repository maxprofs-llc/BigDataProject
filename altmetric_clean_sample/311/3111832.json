We find that the viral transactivator Tat promotes hyperactivation of T cells by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Tat directly interacts with the deacetylase domain of SIRT1 and blocks the ability of SIRT1 to deacetylate lysine 310 in the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. Because acetylated p65 is more active as a transcription factor, Tat hyperactivates the expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, a function lost in SIRT1-\/- cells. These results support a model where the normal function of SIRT1 as a negative regulator of T cell activation is suppressed by Tat during HIV infection. These events likely contribute to the state of immune cell hyperactivation found in HIV-infected individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1c","authors":["Kwon HS","Brent MM","Getachew R","Jayakumar P","Chen LF","Schnolzer M","McBurney MW","Marmorstein R","Greene WC","Ott M","Hye-Sook Kwon","Michael M.
