The resulting electron momentum distributions are recorded as a function of time delay between the IR laser and the attosecond pulse train using a velocity map imaging spectrometer. Because our train of attosecond pulses creates a train of identical electron wave packets, a single ionization event can be studied stroboscopically. This technique has enabled us to image the coherent electron scattering that takes place when the IR field is sufficiently strong to reverse the initial direction of the electron motion causing it to rescatter from its parent ion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Mauritsson J","Johnsson P","Mansten E","Swoboda M","Ruchon T","L'huillier A","Schafer KJ"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T00:35:21+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"7","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1242131416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18352546"],"pmid":"18352546","pubdate":"2008-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Coherent electron scattering captured by an attosecond quantum stroboscope.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coherent-electron-scattering-captured-attosecond-quantum-stroboscope"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":816228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94955,"mean":8.0790639046278,"rank":24727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94955,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11977,"mean":6.7986361055444,"rank":3963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":5945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11977,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":16.020421052632,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Ph.
