Over recent decades, new evidence has been provided about pharmacological treatments, psychosocial interventions or models of care for the long-term management of BD patients. Considering this, guidelines for the maintenance treatment of BD should be regarded as an evidence-based ground for everyday clinical practice in real-life setting. This article critically reviews recently published clinical guidelines on the management of BD patients during the inter-episodic phases of illness, in order to highlight the consensual or controversial recommendations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d5","authors":["Samalin, Ludovic","Murru, Andrea","Vieta, Eduard","Ludovic Samalin"],"doi":"10.1080\/14737175.2016.1176530","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2016-04-13T11:01:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8360","1473-7175"],"journal":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1469664000,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27058008","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14737175.2016.1176530?ai=1mi5h&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/14737175.2016.1176530"],"pmid":"27058008","pubdate":"2016-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Management of inter-episodic periods in patients with bipolar disorder","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-interepisodic-periods-patients-bipolar-disorder"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":3227779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4884056,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274595,"mean":11.496912612802,"rank":95953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":177168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274595,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":709,"mean":4.3115706214689,"rank":294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":709,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":3.738,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
