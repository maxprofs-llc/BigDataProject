Recently resolved relationships among land plants and their algal relatives reveal that land plants evolved PD independently from algae. Proteomic and genetic screens illuminate new dimensions of the structural and regulatory pathways that control PD biogenesis. Biochemical studies demonstrate that immunological signals induce systemic defenses by moving from diseased cells through PD; subsequently, PD transport is restricted to quarantine diseased cells. Here, we review our expanding knowledge of the roles of PD in plant development, physiology, and immunity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a8","authors":["Brunkard, Jacob O","Zambryski, Patricia C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pbi.2016.11.007","endpage":"83","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T08:57:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0356","13695266"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Plant Biology","last_mentioned_on":1481646342,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369526616301947"],"pmid":"27889635","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"76","subjects":["botany"],"title":"Plasmodesmata enable multicellularity: new insights into their evolution, biogenesis, and functions in development and immunity","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasmodesmata-enable-multicellularity-new-insights-evolution-biogenesis-functions-development-immuni"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":5696107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1904324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251242,"mean":12.35648437954,"rank":163146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":75223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251242,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":601,"mean":3.46388,"rank":425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":601,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.5142857142857,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
