The variation in migration leads to different reactivities and diverse cascade transformations. The effect of terminal substituents is very important for the rearrangement. However, it remains ambiguous how terminal substituents govern the selectivity of the rearrangement. This study presents a theoretical model based on the resonance structure of gold activated propargylic ester complexes to rationalize the rearrangement selectivity. Substrates with a major resonance contributor prefer 5-exo-dig cyclization (1,2-migration), while those with a major resonance contributor prefer 6-endo-dig cyclization (1,3-migration). This concise model would be helpful in understanding and tuning the selectivity of the metal catalyzed rearrangement of propargylic esters.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f6100083f3","authors":["Jingxing Jiang","Yan Liu","Cheng Hou","Yinwu Li","Zihong Luan","Cunyuan Zhao","Zhuofeng Ke"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6ob00215c","endpage":"3563","first_seen_on":"2016-12-13T04:14:12+00:00","issns":["1477-0539"],"issue":"14","journal":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1481602419,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/ob\/c6ob00215c#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/ob\/c6ob00215c","pmid":"26975729","pubdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"3558","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"\n              Rationalization of the selectivity between 1,3- and 1,2-migration: a DFT study on gold(\n              i\n              )-catalyzed propargylic ester rearrangement\n            ","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rationalization-selectivity-between-13-12migration-dft-study-gold-i-catalyzed-propargylic-ester-rear"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7881477,"mean":6.674276674566,"rank":4130618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2197439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7881477,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251241,"mean":12.356570179907,"rank":139019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":88528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251241,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1795,"mean":2.9049364548495,"rank":929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1795,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.5853846153846,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
