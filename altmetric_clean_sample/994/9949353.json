We performed whole-exome sequencing and filtered the resulting novel variants by the coordinates of the shared autozygome. We identified a novel splicing variant in RNF216 that is likely to abolish the canonical splice site at the junction of exon\/intron 13 (NM_207111.3:c.2061G>A). We herein report two patients with GHS caused by a novel RNF216 mutation as the first follow up report on RNF216-related GHS, and show interfamilial variability of phenotype supporting the previously reported RNF216-related cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004280","authors":["Alqwaifly, Mohammed","Bohlega, Saeed"],"doi":"10.4081\/ni.2016.6444","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T10:25:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2035-8385","2035-8377"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neurology International","last_mentioned_on":1469183113,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27441066?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4935815","pmid":"27441066","pubdate":"2016-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Ataxia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with intrafamilial variability caused by RNF216 mutation","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ataxia-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism-intrafamilial-variability-caused-rnf216-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8091619,"mean":6.8840984628706,"rank":4279532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2246328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8091619,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257247,"mean":11.936783079231,"rank":141244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257247,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.280511627907,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
