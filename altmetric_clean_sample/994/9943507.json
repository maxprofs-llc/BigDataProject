Among the world oceans, ISWs are particular active in the northern South China Sea (SCS). In this spirit, the SCS Internal Wave Experiment has been conducted since March 2010 using subsurface mooring array. Here, we report an extreme ISW captured on 4 December 2013 with a maximum amplitude of 240\u2009m and a peak westward current velocity of 2.55\u2009m\/s. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the strongest ISW of the world oceans on record. Full-depth measurements also revealed notable impacts of the extreme ISW on deep-ocean currents and thermal structures. Concurrent mooring measurements near Batan Island showed that the powerful semidiurnal internal tide generation in the Luzon Strait was likely responsible for the occurrence of the extreme ISW event. Based on the HYCOM data-assimilation product, we speculate that the strong stratification around Batan Island related to the strengthening Kuroshio may have contributed to the formation of the extreme ISW.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Xiaodong Huang","Zhaohui Chen","Wei Zhao","Zhiwei Zhang","Chun Zhou","Qingxuan Yang","Jiwei Tian"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep30041","first_seen_on":"2016-07-22T06:24:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1505384036,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep30041?WT.feed_name=subjects_physical-oceanography","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep30041?WT.feed_name=subjects_climate-sciences","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep30041"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep30041.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4956752","pmid":"27444063","pubdate":"2016-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Natural hazards","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Physical oceanography","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Fluid dynamics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"30041","subjects":["science"],"title":"An extreme internal solitary wave event observed in the northern South China Sea","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extreme-internal-solitary-wave-event-observed-northern-south-china-sea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":6385306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1142380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260247,"mean":12.019681877915,"rank":182285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260247,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37523,"mean":14.728469164757,"rank":27004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37523,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3257,"mean":16.580687960688,"rank":2251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3257,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
