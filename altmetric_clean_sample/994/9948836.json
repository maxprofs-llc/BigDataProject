Due to the better understanding of NP pathophysiology previously unexplored therapies have been used with encouraging results. In this group, acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic-acid, cannabinoids, clonidine, EMA401, botulinum toxin type A and new voltage-gated sodium channel blockers, can be included. Besides, changing paradigms may occur with the advent of optogenetics and a better understanding of epigenetic regulation. We reviewed the published literature on the pharmacological treatment of NP. Despite the interesting results, randomized controlled trials are demanded the majority of the therapies previously mentioned. In spite of several studies for the relief of NP, pain control continues being a challenge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004280","authors":["Nascimento, Osvaldo J M","Pessoa, Bruno L","Orsini, Marco","Ribeiro, Pedro","Davidovich, Eduardo","Pupe, Camila","Filho, Pedro Moreira","Dornas, Ricardo Menezes","Masiero, Lucas","Bittencourt, Juliana","Bastos, Victor Hugo","Osvaldo J.M.
