The effect of retrograde arch extension on operative and long-term mortality has not been studied and is not incorporated into clinical treatment pathways.\nThe International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection was queried for all patients presenting with acute type B dissection and an identifiable primary intimal tear. Outcomes were stratified according to management for patients with and without retrograde arch extension. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed.\nBetween 1996 and 2014, 404 patients (mean age, 63.3 \u00b1 13.9 years) were identified. Retrograde arch extension existed in 67 patients (16.5%). No difference in complicated presentation was noted (36.8% vs 31.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.46), as defined by limb or organ malperfusion, coma, rupture, and shock. Patients with or without retrograde arch extension received similar treatment, with medical management in 53.7% vs 56.5% (p\u00a0= 0.68), endovascular treatment in 32.8% vs 31.1% (p\u00a0= 0.78), open operation in 11.9% vs 9.5% (p\u00a0= 0.54), or hybrid approach in 1.5% vs 3.0% (p\u00a0= 0.70), respectively. The in-hospital mortality rate was similar for patients with (10.7%) and without (10.4%) retrograde arch extension (p\u00a0= 0.96), and 5-year survival was also similar at 78.3% and 77.8%, respectively (p\u00a0= 0.27).\nThe incidence of retrograde arch dissection involves approximately 16% of patients with acute type B dissection. In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection, this entity seems not to affect management strategy or early and late death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Nauta, Foeke J H","Tolenaar, Jip L","Patel, Himanshu J","Appoo, Jehangir J","Tsai, Thomas T","Desai, Nimesh D","Montgomery, Daniel G","Mussa, Firas F","Upchurch, Gilbert R","Fattori, Rosella","Hughes, G Chad","Nienaber, Christoph A","Isselbacher, Eric M","Eagle, Kim A","Trimarchi, Santi",", ","Foeke J.H.
