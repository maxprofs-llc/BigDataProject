We compare the effectiveness of Zataria multiflora cream and oral metronidazole pill on results of treatment for vaginal infections including Trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis; these infections occur simultaneously. The study included 420 women with bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginalis, or both infections together, who were randomly divided into six groups. Criteria for diagnosis were wet smear and Gram stain. Vaginal Zataria multiflora cream and placebo pill were administered to the experiment groups; the control group received oral metronidazole pill and vaginal placebo cream. Comparison of the clinical symptoms showed no significant difference in all three vaginitis groups receiving metronidazole pill and vaginal Zataria multiflora cream. However, comparison of the wet smear test results was significant in patients with trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis associated with trichomoniasis in the two treatment groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01). Vaginal Zataria multiflora cream had the same effect of oral metronidazole tablets in improving clinical symptoms of all three vaginitis groups, as well as the treatment for bacterial vaginosis. It can be used as a drug for treatment of bacterial vaginosis and elimination of clinical symptoms of Trichomonas vaginitis.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef852a83ee09648b548f","authors":["Abdali, Khadijeh","Jahed, Leila","Amooee, Sedigheh","Zarshenas, Mahnaz","Tabatabaee, Hamidreza","Bekhradi, Reza"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/683640","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-05-06T09:56:36+00:00","issns":["2314-6141","2314-6133"],"journal":"BioMed Research International","last_mentioned_on":1462498080,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26266260?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2015\/683640"],"pmid":"26266260","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"\n              Comparison of the Effect of Vaginal\n              Zataria multiflora\n              Cream and Oral Metronidazole Pill on Results of Treatments for Vaginal Infections including Trichomoniasis and Bacterial Vaginosis in Women of Reproductive Age\n            ","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-effect-vaginal-zataria-multiflora-cream-oral-metronidazole-pill-results-treatments-vagina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7659635,"mean":6.5812991774756,"rank":6628135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7659635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266485,"mean":11.388347345431,"rank":223003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266485,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4131,"mean":2.872184503632,"rank":2978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4131,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":3.1943859649123,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
