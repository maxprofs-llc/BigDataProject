Special focus is given to the definition and symmetry of the dispersion tensor that is controlling how a solute plume spreads out. We show that the dispersion tensor is not symmetric and that the asymmetry derives from the advective derivative in the pore-scale advection-diffusion equation. When flow is spatially variable across a voxel, such as in the presence of a permeability gradient, the amount of asymmetry can be large. As first shown by Auriault [J.-L. Auriault et al. Transp. Porous Med. 85, 771 (2010)TPMEEI0169-391310.1007\/s11242-010-9591-y] in the limit of low P\u00e9clet number, we show that at any P\u00e9clet number, the dispersion tensor D_{ij} satisfies the flow-reversal symmetry D_{ij}(+q)=D_{ji}(-q) where q is the mean flow in the voxel under analysis; however, Reynold's number must be sufficiently small that the flow is reversible when the force driving the flow changes sign. We also demonstrate these symmetries using lattice-Boltzmann simulations and discuss some subtle aspects of how to measure the dispersion tensor numerically. In particular, the numerical experiments demonstrate that the off-diagonal components of the dispersion tensor are antisymmetric which is consistent with the analytical dependence on the average flow gradients that we propose for these off-diagonal components.","authors":["Steven R.
