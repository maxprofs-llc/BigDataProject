Cervical length measurements were carried out at 20 to 24 weeks' gestation and at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation. Both placentas of each twin pair were examined histologically after delivery. The generalized estimation equations models and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analyses.\nMultivariable generalized estimation equations analysis revealed that short cervical length at mid-trimester was independently associated with an increased risk for subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis, whereas short cervical length initially detected early in the third trimester was not. By using the likelihood of SPTB as an outcome variable, multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that short mid-trimester cervical length and histologic chorioamnionitis were independently associated with a greater risk for SPTB. Similarly, based on the multivariable analysis, a short third trimester cervical length was independently and significantly associated with a greater risk for SPTB.\nIn asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies, a short mid-trimester cervical length is independently associated with an increased risk of both subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis and SPTB, whereas a short cervical length initially detected early in the third trimester is independently associated with preterm delivery, but not subsequent histologic chorioamnionitis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jeong Woo Park","Kyo Hoon Park","Eun Young Jung","Soo-Hyun Cho","Ji Ae Jang","Ha-Na Yoo"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0175455","first_seen_on":"2017-04-11T22:06:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1492067365,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0175455&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+plosone%2FPLoSONE+%28PLOS+ONE+-+New+Articles%29","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0175455&utm_source=ifttt"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0175455&type=printable","pmid":"28399138","pubdate":"2017-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Short cervical lengths initially detected in mid-trimester and early in the third trimester in asymptomatic twin gestations: Association with histologic chorioamnionitis and preterm birth","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/short-cervical-lengths-initially-detected-midtrimester-early-third-trimester-asymptomatic-twin-gesta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":5843884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1939401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237248,"mean":12.906699372384,"rank":154886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":68475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237248,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112282,"mean":10.553896634337,"rank":76766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":30002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112282,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4567,"mean":9.8755939553219,"rank":2778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4567,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LibKGC\/statuses\/851919402937180161","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18731583],"posted_on":"2017-04-11T22:06:28+00:00","author":{"name":"\u90e1\u5c71\u5973\u5b50\u5927\u5b66\u56f3\u66f8\u9928","url":"http:\/\/library.koriyama-kgc.ac.jp\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/258237236\/IMGP089101_normal.JPG","description":"\u798f\u5cf6\u770c\u90e1\u5c71\u5e02\u306b\u3042\u308b\u90e1\u5c71\u5973\u5b50\u5927\u5b66\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4eca\u65e5\u3082\u4e00\u65e5\uff0c\u77e5\u8b58\u306e\u7de8\u96c6\u3068\u60c5\u5831\u306e\u63d0\u4f9b\u306b\u596e\u52b1\u52aa\u529b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002","id_on_source":"LibKGC","tweeter_id":"46318156","geo":{"lt":37.75,"ln":140.46778,"country":"JP"},"followers":1147},"tweet_id":"851919402937180161"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AHA1R\/statuses\/852418431790063616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18731583],"posted_on":"2017-04-13T07:09:25+00:00","author":{"name":"\u262c Richard Allen","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/909015308962115585\/MWM2ksAC_normal.jpg","description":"#IamRomani #Palestine #Libya #Bahrain #Educator American in Indonesia.
