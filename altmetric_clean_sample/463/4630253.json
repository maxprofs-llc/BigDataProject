Check it out!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and direct effects of vitamin D on the proliferation and differentiation of muscle precursor cells have been demonstrated in animal models. However, the effects and mechanisms of vitamin D actions in human skeletal muscle, and the presence of the VDR in human adult skeletal muscle, remain to be established. Here, we investigated the role of vitamin D in human muscle cells at various stages of differentiation. We demonstrate that the components of the vitamin D-endocrine system are readily detected in human muscle precursor cells but are low to non-detectable in adult skeletal muscle, and that human muscle cells lack the ability to convert the inactive vitamin D-metabolite 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) to the active 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3). In addition, we show that 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation by altering the expression of cell cycle regulators and myogenic regulatory factors, with associated changes in FOXO3 and Notch signaling pathways. The present data add novel information regarding the direct effects of vitamin D in human skeletal muscle and provide functional and mechanistic insight to the regulation of myoblast cell fate decisions by 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007282","authors":["Karl Olsson","Olsson, Karl","Saini, Amarjit","Str\u00f6mberg, Anna","Alam, Seher","Lilja, Mats","Rullman, Eric","Gustafsson, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1210\/en.2015-1685","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T18:50:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1945-7170","0013-7227"],"issue":"1","journal":"Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1469308152,"links":["http:\/\/press.endocrine.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1210\/en.2015-1685","http:\/\/press.endocrine.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1210\/en.2015-1685","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26469137?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26469137","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:00:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Evidence for vitamin D receptor expression and direct effects of 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 in human skeletal muscle precursor cells","type":"article","volume":"157","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-vitamin-d-receptor-expression-direct-effects-1%CE%B125oh2d3-human-skeletal-muscle-precursor-cell-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":1093429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6998221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243233,"mean":9.5775791754373,"rank":42231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":200886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243233,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3109,"mean":4.0423815958816,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3109,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":5.7757777777778,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":6,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
