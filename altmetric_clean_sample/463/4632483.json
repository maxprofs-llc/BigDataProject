The alarms were placed in the two separate areas at different times and all alarms were eventually removed. Thus, multiple baseline and reversal strategies were used to evaluate program impact. A device planted in a cash drawer was triggered whenever \"bait\" money was removed from the drawer sending an alarm signal directly to police cars and headquarters. On-scene apprehensions of armed robbers within target stores were greatly increased even though the armed robbery systems did not deter robbery incidents nor influence the court disposition of the cases. There was also no crime deterrence, crime displacement, or increased apprehensions in either the immediate neighborhoods of target stores or on a city-wide basis. The cost effectiveness of the program was calculated to be poor even though the program is being maintained because of the absence of an alternative robbery apprehension technology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","authors":["J F Schnelle","R E Kirchner","F Galbaugh","M Domash","A Carr","L Larson"],"doi":"10.1901\/jaba.1979.12-615","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T03:08:26+00:00","issns":["0021-8855"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1444964887,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1311484\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1311484\/pdf\/jaba00107-0131.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1311484","pmid":"120362","pubdate":"1979-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"615","subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Program evaluation research: an experimental cost-effectiveness analysis of an armed robbery intervention program.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/program-evaluation-research-experimental-costeffectiveness-analysis-armed-robbery-intervention-progr-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":2943048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1867330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195832,"mean":10.320475930777,"rank":103929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":71785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195832,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":624,"mean":7.5954574638843,"rank":300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":624,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":9.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/christianmampoo\/statuses\/654856317606039552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4632483],"posted_on":"2015-10-16T03:08:07+00:00","author":{"name":"69'","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tikboy79","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/644336503707963392\/LOYCAERS_normal.jpg","description":"Gulay \u2665 Dahon \u2665 tas si Mary Jane \u2665","id_on_source":"christianmampoo","tweeter_id":"2815979532","followers":526},"tweet_id":"654856317606039552"}]}}
