The results indicated that severe AH conditions, which lead to maximum hemicelluloses dissolution and sugar content in the HH, were not the best for BMP, probably due to the accumulation of toxic\/recalcitrant compounds (furans and lignin). Mild AH conditions (170\u00b0C, 35min and SLR=0.33) led to the highest BMP (0.79Nm(3)kg TOC(-1)), which was confirmed by the desirability tool. HH produced by AH carried out at the desired condition DC2 (178.6\u00b0C, 43.6min and SLR=0.24) showed the lowest accumulation of inhibitory compounds and volatile fatty acids (VFA) and highest BMP (1.56Nm(3)kg TOC(-1)). The modified Gompertz model best fit the experimental data and led to a maximum methane production rate (R) of 2.6mmol CH4d(-1) in the best condition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Ba\u00eata, Bruno Eduardo L\u00f4bo","Lima, Diego Roberto Sousa","Adarme, Oscar Fernando Herrera","Gurgel, Leandro Vin\u00edcius Alves","Aquino, S\u00e9rgio Francisco de"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2015.10.003","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T09:04:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09608524","1873-2976"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1444986246,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0960852415013875"],"pmid":"26476615","pubdate":"2015-10-20T22:01:27+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Optimization of sugarcane bagasse autohydrolysis for methane production from hemicellulose hydrolyzates in a biorefinery concept ","type":"article","volume":"200","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimization-sugarcane-bagasse-autohydrolysis-methane-production-hemicellulose-hydrolyzates-biorefin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":5320545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195832,"mean":10.320456781613,"rank":153793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195832,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1550,"mean":2.0484028405423,"rank":952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1550,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":0.99196078431373,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
