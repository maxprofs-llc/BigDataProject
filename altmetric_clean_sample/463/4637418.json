Prototypic for this group of glycosyltransferase toxins are Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, which modify GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family. However, toxin-induced glucosylation is not restricted to the Clostridia. Various types of bacterial pathogens including Escherichia coli, Yersinia, Photorhabdus and Legionella species possess monoglycosyltransferase activities. Recent studies discovered novel unexpected variations in host protein targets and amino acid acceptors of toxin-catalyzed glycosylation. These findings open new perspectives in toxin as well as in carbohydrate research. This article is protected by copyright.
