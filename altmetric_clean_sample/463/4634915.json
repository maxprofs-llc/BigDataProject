Although isolated case reports and small series have been published, these interesting neoplasms are less well-known. We report a case of a primary intratesticular mucinous cystadenoma in an asymptomatic 44-year-old man. Right radical orchiectomy was performed because a malignant testicular tumor was suspected. We discuss the management of this uncommon testicular tumor based on the limited reports.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f8d","authors":["Celdran, Julian Onate","Rodriguez, Carlos Sanchez","Valverde, Francisco Miguel Gonzalez","Compiano, Luis Oscar Fontana"],"doi":"10.4103\/0973-1482.143363","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T10:30:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1998-4138"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1444991436,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26458610?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26458610","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:04:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Primary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the testis: An extremely rare ovarian-type surface epithelial carcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-mucinous-cystadenocarcinoma-testis-extremely-rare-ovariantype-surface-epithelial-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":5320594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195832,"mean":10.320447334692,"rank":153790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195832,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":1.1617829457364,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.71666666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/654967671365066753","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4634915],"posted_on":"2015-10-16T10:30:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"654967671365066753"}]}}
