The industry has a much weaker record on claims of implied preemption and has lost all challenges brought under equal protection claims in the cases we located. Although the tobacco industry is willing to spend substantial amounts of money on these lawsuits, it never won on constitutional equal protection grounds and lost or dropped 60% (16\/27) of the cases it brought claiming implied state preemption.\nMunicipalities should continue to pass ordinances and be prepared to defend them against claims of implied preemption or on constitutional grounds. If the ordinance is properly prepared they will likely prevail. Health advocates should be prepared to assist in this process.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003670","authors":["M L Nixon","L Mahmoud","S A Glantz"],"doi":"10.1136\/tc.2003.004176","endpage":"73","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T09:20:30+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3318","0964-4563"],"issue":"1","journal":"Tobacco Control","last_mentioned_on":1470052303,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/tc.2003.004176","http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/13\/1\/65.long","http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/13\/1\/65.full.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/13\/1\/65.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1747817","pmid":"14985600","pubdate":"2004-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"65","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Tobacco industry litigation to deter local public health ordinances: the industry usually loses in court","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tobacco-industry-litigation-deter-local-public-health-ordinances-industry-usually-loses-court"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150076,"mean":6.9043957460448,"rank":316226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7832908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150076,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244310,"mean":9.6110256519407,"rank":15309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":228966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244310,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1846,"mean":19.308682926829,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1846,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":15.821052631579,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
