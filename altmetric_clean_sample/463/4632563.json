Recently urinary NGAL (uNGAL) has been proven to be a useful (potentially ideal) biomarker for early detection of CKD. The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation of uNGAL with severity of renal impairment in CKD and to evaluate its prognostic value in these subjects.\nThis was a prospective study carried out over a period of 24 months in subjects with CKD due to primary chronic glomerulonephritis. New cases of CKD stage II, III, IV aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled as per KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines 2012. A total of 90 subjects completed the study up to the end-point. The primary follow-up end-point was 18 months, or decreased glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL\/min. Secondary follow-up end-point was the number of subjects who expired during this period.\nMultiple regression model of estimated glomerular filtration rate showed significant associations with log uNGAL (\u03b2=0.38, P<0.001), Ca\u00d7PO4 (\u03b2=0.60, P<0.001), hemoglobin (\u03b2=0.37, P<0.001), urine protein (\u03b2=0.34, P<0.001), serum albumin (\u03b2=0.48, P<0.001), and systolic blood pressure (\u03b2=0.76, P<0.001). Receiver operator curve for uNGAL considering the progression of CKD showed area under the curve for uNGAL was 0.878 (95% confidence interval: 0.68-0.96). Cut-off value for uNGAL was log 3.5 unit with a sensitivity of 93.08% and specificity of 71.43% for predicting the progression of CKD. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients with log uNGAL levels <3.51 unit had a survival rate of 71.4% while patients with NGAL level >3.51 unit had a renal survival rate of 14.7%.\nOur study result showed that uNGAL has a positive correlation with disease severity which signifies the prognostic importance of uNGAL in CKD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc2e","authors":["Munna Patel","Rekha Sachan","Ravi Misra","Ritual Kamal","Pushplata Sachan","Radhey Shyam"],"doi":"10.2147\/ijnrd.s87423","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T03:33:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-7058"],"journal":"International Journal of Nephrology and Renovascular Disease","last_mentioned_on":1445204145,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/prognostic-significance-of-urinary-ngal-in-chronic-kidney-disease-peer-reviewed-article-IJNRD","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/articles.php?article_id=24157"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=27545","pmid":"26508883","pubdate":"2015-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Prognostic significance of urinary NGAL in chronic kidney disease","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-significance-urinary-ngal-chronic-kidney-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6311249,"mean":5.9753431809371,"rank":2581800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3589753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6311249,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196361,"mean":10.310906997352,"rank":86345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":103687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196361,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.1910697674419,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
