Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether EGF can modulate constituents of FAs and subsequent down-stream events. To this end, EGF-treated keratinocytes were subjected to combined fluorescence imaging and western blotting, to quantify expression and\/or activation of molecules, involved in integrin GFR cross-talk, and receptor proximal and distal signaling events. Generally, EGF response revealed an amplified redistribution or activation of molecules under study, which will be explained in detail from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. In addition to significant activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) at tyrosine Tyr845, a remarkable redistribution was detectable for the focal adhesion constituents, integrin \u00df1 and \u00df3, and zyxin. Increased activation also applied to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) by phosphorylation at Tyr397, Tyr576, and Src at Tyr418, while total FAK remained unchanged. Risen activity was seen as well for the analyzed distal down-stream events, p190RhoGAP and MAP kinases p42\/44. Intriguingly, Src-specific inhibitor Herbimycin A abrogated the entire EGF response except FAK Tyr397 phosphorylation, independent of EGF presence. Mechanistically, our results show that EGF modulates adhesion in a dual fashion, by firstly redistributing focal adhesion constituents to adhesion sites, but also by amplifying levels of activated RhoA antagonist p190RhoGAP, important for cell motility. Further, the findings suggest that the observed EGF response underlies an EGFR integrin cross-talk under recruitment of receptor proximal FAK and Src, and MAP kinase and p190RhoGAP as receptor distal events.","authors":["Eberwein, Philipp","Laird, Dougal","Schulz, Simon","Reinhard, Thomas","Steinberg, Thorsten","Tomakidi, Pascal"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bbamcr.2015.06.004","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T10:48:21+00:00","issns":["0006-3002","01674889"],"journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1449584194,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf14072411=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf14072410=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf14072412=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf14072413=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf16520680=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf16520679=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf16520681=1","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0167488915001949?sf16520682=1"],"pmid":"26079101","pubdate":"2015-06-13T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Modulation of focal adhesion constituents and their down-stream events by EGF: On the cross-talk of integrins and growth factor receptors ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-focal-adhesion-constituents-downstream-events-egf-crosstalk-integrins-growth-factor-recep"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
