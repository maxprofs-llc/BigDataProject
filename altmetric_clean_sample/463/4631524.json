During the scans, subjects performed active knee extension against gravity. Both knees were imaged simultaneously. Lateral patellar tilt (LPT) and bisect offset (BO) were measured to assess tracking. TT-TG distance was measured to assess alignment. Measurements were made in full extension, maximum flexion, and approximately 10\u00b0 increments in between. The significance level was set at P < .05.\nLPT, BO, and TT-TG distance were highest in extension and decreased with flexion. Measurements were higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic knees, with significant differences identified for LPT, BO, and TT-TG distance at 5\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 and for TT-TG distance at 25\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 (P < .05). TT-TG distance was associated with LPT and BO, with r(2) values in symptomatic knees of 0.55 for TT-TG distance and LPT and of 0.45 for TT-TG distance and BO.\nIn patients with unilateral patellar instability, LPT, BO, and TT-TG distance are higher on the unstable side. An association exists between TT-TG distance and the tracking parameters studied, suggesting that TT-TG distance relates to patellar tracking, and a laterally positioned tibial tuberosity may predispose to instability episodes.\nLevel IV, diagnostic study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b2c","authors":["Williams, Ariel A","Elias, John J","Tanaka, Miho J","Thawait, Gaurav K","Demehri, Shadpour","Carrino, John A","Cosgarea, Andrew J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arthro.2015.06.037","first_seen_on":"2015-10-15T23:33:04+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1526-3231","0749-8063"],"journal":"Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic & Related Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1444995639,"links":["http:\/\/www.arthroscopyjournal.org\/article\/S0749-8063(15)00568-X\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.arthroscopyjournal.org\/article\/S074980631500568X\/pdf","pmid":"26440373","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"The Relationship Between Tibial Tuberosity\u2013Trochlear Groove Distance and Abnormal Patellar Tracking in Patients With Unilateral Patellar Instability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-between-tibial-tuberositytrochlear-groove-distance-abnormal-patellar-tracking-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":2123789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4116528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195157,"mean":10.290416579557,"rank":65934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":128197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195157,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1233,"mean":5.0347922077922,"rank":611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1233,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":6.29125,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":10,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"DK":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"DK":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ArthroscopyJ\/statuses\/654802088254279680","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4631524],"posted_on":"2015-10-15T23:32:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Arthroscopy Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.arthroscopyjournal.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/857587216004108288\/7wiL9wOe_normal.jpg","description":"'Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery' and 'Arthroscopy Techniques' cover the newest research in arthroscopy and sports medicine.","id_on_source":"ArthroscopyJ","tweeter_id":"739069405","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7360},"tweet_id":"654802088254279680"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eastwoodortho\/statuses\/654804696616439808","license":"gnip","rt":["ArthroscopyJ"],"citation_ids":[4631524],"posted_on":"2015-10-15T23:43:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Bart Eastwood","url":"http:\/\/orthodoc.aaos.org\/eastwoodortho\/index.cfm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/549017053370544128\/lp79qsj7_normal.jpeg","description":"Orthopedic and sports medicine surgeon.
