Recruitment and activation of immune cells of hematopoietic origin are key elements in the development of atherosclerosis(2). Elegant experimental studies, typically performed in compound mutant mice susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis, indicate important roles for monocytes, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells in lesion formation. While Barger and colleagues proposed a role for vasa vasorum, neovascularization, and intra-plaque hemorrhage with extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) as a mechanism of atherosclerotic lesion progression(3, 4), a direct contribution of RBCs in atherogenesis is uncertain. In this issue of Circulation, Bogdanov and coworkers(5) report that high-fat diet induces RBC dysfunction, which is capable of promoting atherosclerosis by enhancement of the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Daniel I.
