The ability to better distinguish, on a symptom and functional level, between patients who experience depression in the context of bereavement and those with nonbereavement-related depression, could help guide clinical decision making.\nIndividual and clustered depressive symptom and impairment measures were used for modeling bereavement status within a nationally representative longitudinal cohort. Deviance, linear shrinkage factor, and bias-corrected c-statistic were used for identifying a well-calibrated and discriminating final model.\nOf the 450 (1.2%) respondents with a single brief major depressive episode, 162 (38.4%) reported the episode as bereavement-related. The bereaved were less likely to endorse worthlessness (P < .001), social conflict (P < .001), distress (P < .001), thoughts of suicide (P = .001), wanting to die (P = .01), self-medicating (P = .01), and being withdrawn (P = .04). In a multivariate model, the bereaved were more likely to have thoughts of their own death (P = .003), guilt coupled with weight or appetite loss (P = .013), and were less likely to report social conflict (P < .001), worthlessness coupled with difficulty making decisions (P < .001), thoughts of suicide (P = .006), distress coupled with weight or appetite gain (P = .022), and self-medicating (P = .045).\nTraits and trait combinations differentiate individuals who experience brief depressive episodes following the death of a loved one from other brief episodes. These differences can help guide clinical care of patients who present with depressive symptoms shortly after a loved one's death.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026dc","authors":["McCabe, Patrick J.","Christopher, Paul P."],"doi":"10.1002\/da.22446","endpage":"119","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T14:34:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1520-6394"],"issue":"2","journal":"Depression & Anxiety (1091-4269)","last_mentioned_on":1445041181,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/da.22446"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/da.22446\/pdf","pmid":"26474367","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"112","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"SYMPTOM AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS OF BRIEF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODES AND DISCRIMINATION OF BEREAVEMENT","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/symptom-functional-traits-brief-major-depressive-episodes-discrimination-bereavement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6495032,"mean":5.9872943938216,"rank":4558387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1697283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6495032,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208244,"mean":10.018854031108,"rank":132318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":66049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208244,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":834,"mean":6.208487394958,"rank":581,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":834,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.4705128205128,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
