Forty per cent reported lipodystrophy, 40% had documented weight loss (mean 6.6 kg). Mean intake 13,400 kJ (118% of estimated requirements calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation). One hundred (82%) were taking antiretroviral therapy. Using forward stepwise logistic regression analysis only viral load (VL) was significantly associated with weight loss when intake, CD4 T-cell count, lipodystrophy, and age were entered into the model with VL (log copies\/mL). Every one log increase in HIV VL was associated with an odds of weight loss of 1.58 (P=0.0008). Weight loss is still common in the HAART era. HIV VL was the most significant predictor of weight loss in this sample. Inadequate dietary intake and self-reported lipodystrophy were not related to weight loss in this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006615","authors":["Marijka J Batterham","Roger Garsia","Philippa Greenop"],"doi":"10.1258\/095646202320753682","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T06:24:58+00:00","issns":["0956-4624","1758-1052"],"issue":"11","journal":"International Journal of STD & AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1072915200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1258\/095646202320753682"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/std.sagepub.com\/content\/13\/11\/744.full.pdf","pmid":"12437893","pubdate":"2002-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Prevalence and predictors of HIV-associated weight loss in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-predictors-hivassociated-weight-loss-era-highly-active-antiretroviral-therapy-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085712,"mean":6.894559944072,"rank":2037124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4956150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085712,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243989,"mean":9.6086374247913,"rank":71536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243989,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":2.6175973154362,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":1.9782258064516,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
