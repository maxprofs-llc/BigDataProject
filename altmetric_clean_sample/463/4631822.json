P4H9-detected molecule (PDM) expression appeared to be associated with myofibroblast differentiation. In this study, we investigated whether PDM is expressed on fibroblasts and cancer cells in clinical tissue samples, and whether the presence of PDM-expressing colorectal cancer cells is correlated with clinicopathological features of patients.\nImmunohistochemistry was conducted to detect P4H9 on clinical tissue samples from 156 patients with colorectal cancer. Risk factors for metastases and survival were calculated for clinical implication of PDM-expressing spindle-shaped fibroblasts.\nMultivariate analysis showed that PDM-expressing spindle-shaped fibroblasts were an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis, hematogenous metastasis, and poor survival. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated that PDM-expressing spindle-shaped fibroblasts were associated with shorter survival time (P<0.0001). Immunofluorescence showed PDM expression on CCD-18Co fibroblasts and two colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HCT-15).\nPDM-expressing spindle-shaped fibroblasts are associated with metastasis and shorter survival in colorectal cancer patients. PDM-expressing spindle-shaped fibroblasts may have a role in eliciting the malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 15 October 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2015.363 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["Shozo Yokoyama","Junji Ieda","Naoyuki Yamamoto","Shunsuke Yamaguchi","Yasuyuki Mitani","Akihiro Takeuchi","Katsunari Takifuji","Tsukasa Hotta","Kenji Matsuda","Takashi Watanabe","John E Shively","Hiroki Yamaue"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2015.363","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T00:36:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1445016542,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/bjc2015363a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/v113\/n10\/full\/bjc2015363a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/0EPXJLXupu4\/bjc.2015.363"],"pmid":"26469833","pubdate":"2015-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"P4H9-detected molecule expression on spindle-shaped fibroblasts indicates malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p4h9detected-molecule-expression-spindleshaped-fibroblasts-indicates-malignant-phenotype-colorectal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":815238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":5389637,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195832,"mean":10.320383759466,"rank":37508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":156529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195832,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3025,"mean":8.8377149470899,"rank":910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3025,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":10.151052631579,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"P4H9detected molecule expression on spindleshaped fibroblasts indicates malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=23043938489&p=1pl&v=1&x=PWZX0PNL1AW8h5AvRWbLxQ","license":"public","citation_ids":[4631822],"posted_on":"2015-10-16T17:29:02+00:00","summary":"Related Biotechnology, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare News Original Article: P4H9-detected molecule expression on spindle-shaped fibroblasts indicates malignant phenotype of colorectal cancer NEXT ARTICLE More From BioPortfolio on \"P4H9-detected\u2026","author":{"name":"Bioportfolio","url":"http:\/\/www.bioportfolio.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/821\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2015-12-11_at_16.36.54.png?1449851849"}}]}}
