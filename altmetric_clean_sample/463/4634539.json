In several malignant transformations, the expression of HLA-G by tumor cells rises dramatically, rendering them strongly immunosuppressive. In this study, we postulated that the absence of HLA-G receptors would prevent the immunosuppressive effects of both soluble and membrane-bound HLA-G. Thus, we investigated the therapeutic potential of effector NK cells genetically modified to downregulate the expression of ILT2 (HLA-G receptor) on their cell surfaces. We have shown that the proliferation of modified NK is still dependent on stimulation signals (no malignant transformation). ILT2- NK cells proliferate, migrate, and eliminate HLA-G negative targets cells to the same extent parental NK cells do. However, in the presence of HLA-G positive tumors, ILT2- NK cells exhibit superior proliferation, conjugate formation, degranulation, and killing activities compared to parent NK cells. We tested the effectiveness of ILT2- NK cells in vivo using a xenograft cancer model and found that silencing ILT2 rescued their anti-tumor activity.We believe that combining ILT2- NK cells with existing therapeutic strategies will strengthen the antitumor response in cancer patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Wu, Danli","Kuiaste, Isere","Moreau, Philippe","Carosella, Edgardo","Yotnda, Patricia","Danli Wu","Isere Kuiaste","Philippe Moreau","Edgardo Carosella","Patricia Yotnda"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.6044","first_seen_on":"2015-10-16T10:15:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"35","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1463341186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26460949?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4741936\/pdf\/oncotarget-06-37385.pdf","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.18632\/oncotarget.6044"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=download&path%5B%5D=6044&path%5B%5D=14737","pmcid":"PMC4741936","pmid":"26460949","pubdate":"2015-10-16T22:03:50+00:00","publisher":"Impact Journals","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Rescuing lymphocytes from HLA-G immunosuppressive effects mediated by the tumor microenvironment.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/6044","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rescuing-lymphocytes-hlag-immunosuppressive-effects-mediated-tumor-microenvironment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":5823154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1038874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241842,"mean":9.4360583771982,"rank":166865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":41000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241842,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7751,"mean":2.922367483871,"rank":3886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7751,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":918,"mean":1.5590905125409,"rank":491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":918,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
