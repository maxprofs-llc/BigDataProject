Patients with presumed benign or borderline adnexal disease, and benign and early stage malignant uterine disease were prospectively included.\nMedian age was 52\u00a0years (range 19-79\u00a0years), and median BMI was 23.7 (range 17.3-34.0\u00a0kg\/m(2)). Sixty-two patients (32.5\u00a0%) underwent mono\/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or cyst removal (Group A), four patients (2.7\u00a0%) myomectomy (Group B), 46 patients (31.5\u00a0%) total hysterectomy (Group C), and 34 (23.3\u00a0%) endometrial cancer staging (Group D). Median docking time was 7\u00a0min (range 3-36). Median OT was 35\u00a0min (range 17-145) in the Group A, 40\u00a0min (range 10-50) in the Group B, 133\u00a0min (range 58-320) in the Group C, and 160\u00a0min (range 69-290) in the Group D. Reduction in OT over the study period for hysterectomy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and adnexal surgery (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002) was observed. We registered two laparoscopic conversion (3.2\u00a0%) in the Group A and two (4.3\u00a0%) in the Group C. In the Group D, we showed one (2.9\u00a0%) laparoscopic and two (5.8\u00a0%) laparotomic conversions. One patient (2.17\u00a0%) in the Group C was readmitted in the early postoperative period for severe vaginal bleeding.\nWe report the first series of a novel robotic approach for the treatment of various gynecological conditions. When performed by experienced minimally invasive surgeons, TELELAP ALF-X is feasible and safe. Further studies are mandatory to define the benefits, advantages, and costs of this new robotic approach with respect to others minimally invasive approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Francesco Fanfani","Giorgia Monterossi","Anna Fagotti","Cristiano Rossitto","Salvatore Gueli Alletti","Barbara Costantini","Valerio Gallotta","Luigi Selvaggi","Stefano Restaino","Giovanni Scambia"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-015-4187-9","endpage":"221","first_seen_on":"2015-04-04T02:19:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2218"],"issue":"1","journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1473897600,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00464-015-4187-9","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00464-015-4187-9","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25840895","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25840895?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00464-015-4187-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00464-015-4187-9.pdf","pmid":"25840895","pubdate":"2015-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"215","subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"The new robotic TELELAP ALF-X in gynecological surgery: single-center experience.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-robotic-telelap-alfx-gynecological-surgery-singlecenter-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":1500821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6873556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201074,"mean":9.4389264794379,"rank":45218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":155602,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201074,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3311,"mean":2.7716271903323,"rank":257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3311,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.7792207792208,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
