To examine this hypothesis, we aimed to determine whether the known RLS genetic markers may be associated with PD risk, as well as with PD subtype.\nTwo case-control cohorts from Tel-Aviv and New-York, including 1133 PD patients and 867 controls were genotyped for four RLS-related SNPs in the genes MEIS1, BTBD9, PTPRD and MAP2K5\/SKOR1. The association between genotype, PD risk and phenotype was tested using multivariate regression models.\nNone of the tested SNPs was significantly associated with PD risk, neither in any individual cohort nor in the combined analysis after correction for multiple comparisons. The MAP2K5\/SKOR1 marker rs12593813 was associated with higher frequency of tremor in the Tel-Aviv cohort (61.0% vs. 46.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, dominant model). However, the risk allele for tremor in this gene has been associated with reduced RLS risk. Moreover, this association did not replicate in Tremor-dominant PD patients from New-York.\nRLS genetic risk markers are not associated with increased PD risk or subtype in the current study. Together with previous genetic, neuropathological and epidemiologic studies, our results further strengthen the notion that RLS and PD are likely to be distinct entities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003296","authors":["Gan-Or, Ziv","Alcalay, Roy N","Bar-Shira, Anat","Leblond, Claire S","Postuma, Ronald B","Ben-Shachar, Shay","Waters, Cheryl","Johnson, Amelie","Levy, Oren","Mirelman, Anat","Gana-Weisz, Mali","Dupr\u00e9, Nicolas","Montplaisir, Jacques","Giladi, Nir","Fahn, Stanley","Xiong, Lan","Dion, Patrick A","Orr-Urtreger, Avi","Rouleau, Guy A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.parkreldis.2015.03.010","first_seen_on":"2015-04-05T23:18:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1873-5126"],"journal":"Parkinsonism & Related Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1427796416,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25817513","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25817513?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25817513","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Genetic markers of Restless Legs Syndrome in Parkinson disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-markers-restless-legs-syndrome-parkinson-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4964014,"mean":5.8803944095254,"rank":2633405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1661697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4964014,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147341,"mean":10.208020116737,"rank":85340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147341,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":798,"mean":2.8147804265997,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":798,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":4.59,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
