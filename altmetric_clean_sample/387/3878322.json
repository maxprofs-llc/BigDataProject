If so, the resulting transformation rules could be used to pool research data based on the two criteria sets.\nThe pre-post deployment study (PPDS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) administered a blended 30-day DSM-IV and DSM-5 PTSD symptom assessment based on the civilian PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV (PCL-C) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). This assessment was completed by 9,193 soldiers from three US Army Brigade Combat Teams approximately 3 months after returning from Afghanistan. PCL-C items were used to operationalize conservative and broad approximations of DSM-5 PTSD diagnoses. The operating characteristics of these approximations were examined compared to diagnoses based on actual DSM-5 criteria.\nThe estimated 30-day prevalence of DSM-5 PTSD based on conservative (4.3%) and broad (4.7%) approximations of DSM-5 criteria using DSM-IV symptom assessments were similar to estimates based on actual DSM-5 criteria (4.6%). Both approximations had excellent sensitivity (92.6-95.5%), specificity (99.6-99.9%), total classification accuracy (99.4-99.6%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.96-0.98).\nDSM-IV symptoms can be used to approximate DSM-5 diagnoses of PTSD among recently deployed soldiers, making it possible to recode symptom-level data from earlier DSM-IV studies to draw inferences about DSM-5 PTSD. However, replication is needed in broader trauma-exposed samples to evaluate the external validity of this finding.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026dc","authors":["Rosellini, Anthony J.","Stein, Murray B.","Colpe, Lisa J.","Heeringa, Steven G.","Petukhova, Maria V.","Sampson, Nancy A.","Schoenbaum, Michael","Ursano, Robert J.","Kessler, Ronald C."],"doi":"10.1002\/da.22364","endpage":"501","first_seen_on":"2015-04-05T00:10:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6394"],"issue":"7","journal":"Depression & Anxiety (1091-4269)","last_mentioned_on":1428192600,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/da.22364\/abstract;jsessionid=7EC8C0AB5668962CB5DE2AF126069F6F.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/da.22364\/pdf","pmid":"25845710","pubdate":"2015-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"493","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"APPROXIMATING A DSM\u20105 DIAGNOSIS OF PTSD USING DSM\u2010IV CRITERIA","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/approximating-dsm5-diagnosis-ptsd-using-dsmiv-criteria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6361016,"mean":5.9829594792654,"rank":4702402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":944312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6361016,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159888,"mean":10.089374445702,"rank":114155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":27810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159888,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":731,"mean":7.5808630136986,"rank":537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":731,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.6268333333333,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
