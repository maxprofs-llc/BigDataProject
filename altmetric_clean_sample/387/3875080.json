In this review, we begin with a clinical overview of ASD, highlighting the heterogeneity of the disorder. We then discuss the genetics of ASD and present updated guidelines on genetic testing. We then consider the insights gained from the identification of both single gene disorders and rare variants, with regard to clinical phenomenology and potential treatment targets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c15","authors":["Baker, Elizabeth","Jeste, Shafali Spurling"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcl.2015.03.003","first_seen_on":"2015-04-04T02:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0031-3955","1557-8240"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pediatric clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1438627729,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pediatric.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0031-3955%252815%252900023-1%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=pcl-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022165","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26022165?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pediatric.theclinics.com\/article\/S0031395515000231\/pdf","pmid":"26022165","pubdate":"2015-05-30T10:28:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Diagnosis and Management of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Era of Genomics: Rare Disorders Can Pave the Way for Targeted Treatments.","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diagnosis-management-autism-spectrum-disorder-era-genomics-rare-disorders-pave-way-targeted-treatmen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436647,"mean":6.3270035691119,"rank":2091544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3301158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436647,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154009,"mean":10.322204898447,"rank":58993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":93488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154009,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":454,"mean":2.5007240618102,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":454,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.2969090909091,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
