PIK3CA is a gene that encodes \u03b1 catalytic subunit of this enzyme. A common polymorphism of PIK3CA, rs7640662 (C\/G), was analyzed, and its association to breast cancer cases was determined. In this study, DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 278 women suffering from breast cancer and 128 healthy women. Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) method was performed to genotype rs7640662. P values and ODD ratios were measured using SPSS. P value less than 0.05 and ODD ratios more than 1 were considered as significant. All ODD ratios were less than 1, and P values were more than 0.05 showing that rs7640662 (C\/G) and breast cancer are not significantly associated. However, the genotypes observed in the Persian population, as an ancient population living in the Middle East, was significantly different from the genotypes reported by HapMap for Asian populations. As a conclusion, rs7640662 was not associated with the risk of breast cancer in a Persian population; however, it was observed that heterozygote (GC) is the most common genotypes in both case and control samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a71","authors":["Atefeh Mir","Mahdiyeh Harati Sadegh","Zahra Ahmadinia","Parham Jabbarzadeh Kaboli"],"doi":"10.1556\/imas.7.2015.1.1","first_seen_on":"2015-04-05T18:10:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2061-1617"],"issue":"1","journal":"Interventional Medicine and Applied Science","last_mentioned_on":1428257412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4369140\/"],"pmid":"25838920","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3","startpage":"3","title":"PIK3CA rs7640662 (C\/G) single nucleotide polymorphism lacks association with breast cancer cases in Persians","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pik3ca-rs7640662-cg-single-nucleotide-polymorphism-lacks-association-breast-cancer-cases-persians"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4959518,"mean":5.8767582456149,"rank":2630961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1660285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4959518,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147265,"mean":10.208222919383,"rank":85313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147265,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9657894736842,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
