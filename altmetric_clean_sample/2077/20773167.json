It is now known that deficiencies of vitamin B12 and copper have similar neurologic manifestations. Bariatric surgery is a risk factor for both. Alcoholism is just one of the many causes of thiamine deficiency. Early neurologic complications following bariatric surgery are often due to thiamine deficiency. Encephalopathy in the setting of alcoholism that persists despite thiamine replacement should prompt consideration of niacin deficiency. Pyridoxine deficiency and toxicity both have neurologic sequelae. Vitamin D deficiency and the risk for multiple sclerosis has been an area of ongoing research.\nOptimal functioning of the nervous system is dependent on a constant supply of certain vitamins and nutrients. This article discusses neurologic manifestations related to deficiency of these key nutrients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610006feb","authors":["Kumar, Neeraj","Neeraj Kumar"],"doi":"10.1212\/01.con.0000520630.69195.90","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T09:02:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1538-6899","1080-2371"],"issue":"3, Neurology of Systemic Disease","journal":"Continuum: Lifelong Learning in Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1505375394,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28570331","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28570331\/?i=11&from=b12","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/continuum\/Abstract\/2017\/06000\/Nutrients_and_Neurology.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/continuum\/2017\/06000\/Nutrients_and_Neurology.15.pdf","pmid":"28570331","pubdate":"2017-06-02T22:02:16+00:00","publisher":"LWW","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"822","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Nutrients and Neurology.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/continuum\/Fulltext\/2017\/06000\/Nutrients_and_Neurology.15.aspx","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutrients-neurology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":3658529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4635167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246328,"mean":12.619204163571,"rank":101258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":141087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246328,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221,"mean":3.1766272727273,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.05,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
