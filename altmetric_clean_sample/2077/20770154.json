In contrast to previous studies, we simultaneously observed and measured pore-scale fluid behavior and three-phase constitutive relationships with digital image acquisition\/analysis, fluid pressure control, and permeability assays. Our results showed that the fluid layers significantly influenced pore-scale, three-phase fluid displacement as well as water relative permeability. At low water saturation, water relative permeability not only depended on water saturation but also on the distributions of air and diesel. The results also indicate that the relative permeability-saturation model proposed by Parker et al. (1987) could not completely describe the experimental data from our three-phase flow experiments because these models ignore the effects of phase distribution. A simple bundle-of-tubes model shows that the water relative permeability was proportional to the number of apparently continuous water paths before the critical stage in which no apparently continuous water flow path could be found. Our findings constitute additional information about the essential constitutive relationships involved in both the understanding and the modeling of three-phase flows in porous media.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Jui-Pin Tsai","Liang-Cheng Chang","Shao-Yiu Hsu","Hsin-Yu Shan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-015-4931-7","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T06:44:04+00:00","issns":["0944-1344","1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1432684800,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s11356-015-4931-7"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11356-015-4931-7.pdf","pmid":"26150292","pubdate":"2015-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effects of liquid layers and distribution patterns on three-phase saturation and relative permeability relationships: a micromodel study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-liquid-layers-distribution-patterns-threephase-saturation-relative-permeability-relationship"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7843802,"mean":6.6458872962179,"rank":4107953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2185923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7843802,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104472,"mean":10.861335815681,"rank":53875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":40514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104472,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1992,"mean":2.484320441989,"rank":613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1992,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.1610144927536,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1}}}},"posts":{"peer_reviews":[{"title":"Effects of liquid layers and distribution patterns on three-phase saturation and relative permeability relationships: a micromodel study","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/review\/qS8SG3iy\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[20770154],"posted_on":"2015-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Amin Zarandi","url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/author\/926219\/","id_on_source":926219},"pr_id":"publons","publons_quality_score":null,"publons_significance_score":null,"publons_review_type":null,"publons_weighted_average":null,"publons_article_url":"https:\/\/publons.com\/publon\/162705\/","pubpeer_publication_url":null}]}}
