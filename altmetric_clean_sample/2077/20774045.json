In this study, saliva antibodies binding to oxLDL, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), were characterized and their cross reactivity was evaluated.\nResting and stimulated saliva samples were collected from 36 healthy adults (mean age 26 years). Saliva IgA, IgG and IgM autoantibody levels to copper oxidized LDL (CuOx-LDL) and malondialdehyde acetaldehyde modified LDL (MAA-LDL), were determined with chemiluminescence immunoassay.\nSaliva IgA and IgG antibodies binding to MAA-LDL and CuOx-LDL were detected in all samples and they were associated with the saliva levels of IgA and IgG to P.gingivalis and A.actinomycetemcomitans. Competitive immunoassay showed that saliva antibodies to MAA-LDL cross-reacted specifically with P.gingivalis. The autoantibody levels to oxLDL in saliva were not associated with the autoantibody levels to oxLDL in plasma or with saliva apolipoprotein B 100 levels.\nSaliva contains IgA and IgG binding to oxLDL, which showed cross-reactive properties with the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g). The data suggests that secretory IgA to P.g may participate in immune reactions involved in LDL oxidation through molecular mimicry. This article is protected by copyright.
