It is prognostically similar to teratoma and requires no additional chemotherapy in the absence of a nonteratomatous GCT component. We report a case of metastatic CTT in a patient with primary testicular teratoma without prior chemotherapy. Retroperitoneal lymph node metastases contained teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, and CTT. The CTT was \u03b2-hCG positive and SALL4 negative by immunohistochemistry (IHC). CTT can arise in metastatic testicular GCT in treatment na\u00efve patients. An important differential diagnosis is choriocarcinoma due to treatment implications, and SALL4 IHC may help.","altmetric_jid":"537f30862a83eeb45a8b45bd","authors":["Wang, Michael L.","McHugh, Jonathan B.","Weizer, Alon Z.","Morgan, Todd M.","Chinnaiyan, Arul M.","Sciallis, Andrew P.","Lagstein, Amir","Spratt, Daniel E.","Mehra, Rohit"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.eucr.2017.04.014","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T10:17:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2214-4420"],"journal":"Urology Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1496398632,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28567335?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5443920","pmid":"28567335","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"Rare Presentation of Metastatic Cystic Trophoblastic Tumor in a\u00a0Patient Without Prior Chemotherapy","type":"article","volume":"13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":7183444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241690,"mean":12.177493398541,"rank":196759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241690,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":1.7860784313725,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.0630434782609,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/870585082209198080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20774560],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T10:17:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"870585082209198080"}]}}
