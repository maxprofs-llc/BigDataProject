We present a systematic review of mHealth applications available on the Italian market and for the Italian speakers in order to assess their reported usability and functions. The review shows that there are rather few products on offer and the ones that are available display weak educational components, do not seem to be based on solid theoretical models of behavior change or decision making, and do not seem to be intended as devices to be integrated in the ecology of the doctor-patient relationship.","authors":["Maria Grazia Rossi","Sarah Bigi"],"doi":"10.21037\/mhealth.2017.04.06","first_seen_on":"2017-06-02T10:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["23069740","2306-9740"],"journal":"mHealth","last_mentioned_on":1496413152,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28567412?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC5427191","pmid":"28567412","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"mHealth for diabetes support: a systematic review of apps available on the Italian market","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mhealth-diabetes-support-systematic-review-apps-available-italian-market"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"GB":1,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/doctick\/statuses\/870581996380094464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20774242],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T10:04:57+00:00","author":{"name":"doctick","url":"http:\/\/doctick.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502911606083166208\/Mo60jRB-_normal.png","description":"Working on medical online calculators and automated notification systems for science articles & #healtcareIT trends...","id_on_source":"doctick","tweeter_id":"2295768584","geo":{"lt":41.38879,"ln":2.15899,"country":"ES"},"followers":252},"tweet_id":"870581996380094464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/caring_mobile\/statuses\/870582738084122624","license":"gnip","rt":["doctick"],"citation_ids":[20774242],"posted_on":"2017-06-02T10:07:54+00:00","author":{"name":"CareMo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/727239253529350144\/Syga1r2Z_normal.jpg","description":"We want you to find the best digital health strategy!
