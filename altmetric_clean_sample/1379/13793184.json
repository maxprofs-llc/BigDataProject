Forty-four PhD students completed evening and morning questionnaires on eight days from 1\u00a0month before their dissertation defense until one month thereafter. Results showed increased stress leading up to the defense, while fatigue and sleep quality remained unchanged. Comparing the night before the defense with the night after, stress rapidly decreased, whereas fatigue and sleep quality increased. Following the defense, stress and sleep quality remained stable, whereas fatigue declined. Stress 1\u00a0month before the defense was higher than 1\u00a0month thereafter. Regarding day-level relations, stress was adversely affected by negative anticipation and favorably by positive outcome expectancy, whereas positive anticipation had no influence. Positive outcome expectancy was an important predictor of improved sleep quality. We conclude that stress may be elevated long before a stressful event takes place but that one can recover rather quickly from temporary stress. Positive outcome expectancy of a stressful event may be an important predictor of reduced day-level stress and improved day-level sleep quality leading up to a stressful event.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035cb","authors":["Van Laethem, Michelle","Beckers, Debby G.J.","Dijksterhuis, Ap","Geurts, Sabine
