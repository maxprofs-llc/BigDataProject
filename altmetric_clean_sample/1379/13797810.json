Hydrovatus is the third most species rich genus of diving beetles (Dytiscidae). It occurs on all continents except Antarctica and now numbers 210 currently recognized species. Both new species, Hydrovatus diversipunctatussp. n. and Hydrovatus globosussp. n., were collected at lights and are only known from the type locality \"Khon Kaen\" (a city and province). Diagnoses based on morphology for the separation from closely related species are given together with illustrations of male genitalia and habitus photos. We provide a determination key to Old World species of the pustulatus species group and to Oriental species of the oblongipennis species group.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004744","authors":["",""],"doi":"10.3897\/zookeys.632.10483","endpage":"66","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T16:56:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1313-2970","1313-2989"],"issue":"632","journal":"ZooKeys","last_mentioned_on":1479465278,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3897\/zookeys.632.10483"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/zookeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&amp;item_id=","pmid":"27920604","pubdate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"57","title":"Two new species of the megadiverse lentic diving-beetle genus Hydrovatus (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae) described from NE Thailand","type":"article","volume":"632","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-new-species-megadiverse-lentic-divingbeetle-genus-hydrovatus-coleoptera-dytiscidaedescribed-ne-t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711702,"mean":6.6147835493025,"rank":5831199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711702,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248042,"mean":12.149026427082,"rank":170517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":47796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248042,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2348,"mean":15.531304644227,"rank":1933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2348,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122,"mean":22.809305785124,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"ZooKeys","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154861198479155&id=269910624154","license":"public","citation_ids":[13797810],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T10:34:38+00:00","summary":"2 new species join the lines of the 3rd most diverse genus of diving beetles \n\nCollected from Thailand, the new species were spotted among the unsorted diving beetles in the Hungarian Natural History Museum\u2019s collection.\n\nThe journal paper is openly availa","author":{"name":"Luonnontieteellinen museo","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/269910624154","facebook_wall_name":"Luonnontieteellinen museo","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/269910624154\/picture","id_on_source":"269910624154"}},{"title":"Photos from ZooKeys's post","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1430630200298501&id=165007823527418","license":"public","citation_ids":[13797810],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T09:05:18+00:00","summary":"2 new species join the lines of the 3rd most diverse genus of diving beetles \n\nCollected from Thailand, the new species were spotted among the unsorted diving beetles in the Hungarian Natural History Museum\u2019s collection.\n\nThe journal paper is openly availa","author":{"name":"ZooKeys","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/165007823527418","facebook_wall_name":"ZooKeys","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/165007823527418\/picture","id_on_source":"165007823527418"}}]}}
