The analysis captured direct medical costs associated with insulin treatment (insulin, needles, and self-monitored glucose testing) and costs related to managing hypoglycemic episodes. There were a total of 59,780 T1DMBBT patients, 383,145 T2DMBOT patients, and 171,325 T2DMBBT patients expected to be using long-acting insulin. A sensitivity analysis on the entire US population was also conducted.\nAmong T1DMBBT patients, IDeg was associated with an annual cost savings of -$357.13 per-patient per-year (PPPY), driven primarily by reduced insulin utilization. IDeg was also found to be cost-saving among T2DMBOT patients (-$1,206.61 PPPY), driven primarily by reductions in the cost of treating severe hypoglycemic episodes. Among T2DMBBT patients, IDeg was associated with an additional cost to the plan of $1,420.04 PPPY; however, this result was driven by a higher insulin dose for IDeg compared to IGlar. Overall, IDeg demonstrated cost savings of $240 million per year, which accounted for a total cost savings of 3.5% vs. IGlar.\nThe results of this analysis suggest that the reduced insulin utilization and fewer hypoglycemic episodes associated with IDeg may translate into reduced costs for payers. The model is limited by simplification of a complex disease state and assumptions surrounding disease state, treatment patterns, and costs. Therefore, results may not accurately reflect actual health plans or real-world practice patterns.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002692","authors":["James Weatherall"],"doi":"10.1080\/03007995.2016.1251893","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T12:28:31+00:00","issns":["1473-4877","0300-7995"],"journal":"Current Medical Research & Opinion","last_mentioned_on":1479472095,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/03007995.2016.1251893?ai=1msw4&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27764979","pubdate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Budget impact of treating commercially insured type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in the United States with insulin degludec compared to insulin glargine","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/budget-impact-treating-commercially-insured-type-1-type-2-diabetes-patients-united-states-insulin-de"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":5831206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248042,"mean":12.149035296584,"rank":170518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":47778,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248042,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1663,"mean":4.3753321299639,"rank":1102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1663,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.5520833333333,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CMRO_Journal\/statuses\/799590037876776961","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13792402],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T12:28:15+00:00","author":{"name":"CMRO Medical Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.cmrojournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/474492886721896449\/Ja86fSwn_normal.jpeg","description":"Current Medical Research & Opinion - \nMEDLINE-indexed journal for rapid publication of clinical evidence","id_on_source":"CMRO_Journal","tweeter_id":"27037879","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":3537},"tweet_id":"799590037876776961"}]}}
