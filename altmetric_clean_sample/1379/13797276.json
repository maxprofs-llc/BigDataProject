An antiserum against P. pectinifera RGP (PpeRGP) was produced by immunizing rabbits with a PpeRGP sulfanyl-polyethylene glycol derivative conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as the antigen. The antiserum was used for the development of a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of RGP. In binding experiments using radioiodinated PpeRGP and antiserum against the antiserum, a displacement curve was obtained using radioinert PpeRGP. The sensitivity of the RIA, defined as the amount of PpeRGP that significantly decreased the counts by 2 SD from the 100% bound point, averaged 0.040 \u00b1 0.002 pmoles PpeRGP per 100 \u03bcl assay buffer (0.40 \u00b1 0.02 nM) in 10 assays. Intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 6.1% and 2.7%, respectively. Serial dilution of whole homogenates from the radial nerve cords and circumoral nerve-rings of P. pectinifera produced displacement curves parallel to the PpeRGP standard. Thus, the amounts of PpeRGP were determined as 1.54 \u00b1 0.09 pmoles\/mg wet weight of radial nerves and 0.87 \u00b1 0.04 pmoles\/mg wet weight of nerve-rings, respectively. On contrary, pyloric stomach, pyloric caeca, tube-feet, ovaries, testes, and ovarian follicle cells did not react in the RIA system. Furthermore, the A- and B-chains of PpeRGP, Asterias amurensis RGP, bovine insulin, and human relaxin did not show cross-reactivity in the RIA. These results strongly suggest that the RIA system is a highly specific and sensitive with respect to PpeRGP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002936","authors":["Yamamoto, Kazutoshi","Kiyomoto, Masato","Katayama, Hidekazu","Mita, Masatoshi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ygcen.2016.11.007","endpage":"88","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T16:29:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-6840","00166480"],"journal":"General & Comparative Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1479500034,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S001664801630380X"],"pmid":"27838378","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"84","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Radioimmunoassay of relaxin-like gonad-stimulating peptide in the starfish Patiria (=Asterina) pectinifera","type":"article","volume":"243","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radioimmunoassay-relaxinlike-gonadstimulating-peptide-starfish-patiria-asterina-pectinifera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":3339561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4285378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248043,"mean":12.148933100039,"rank":107105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":136816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248043,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":739,"mean":2.4224498644986,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":739,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.4690476190476,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MauriceElphick\/statuses\/799650804894433280","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13797276],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T16:29:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Maurice Elphick","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/860896140644012032\/IFuIjBKB_normal.jpg","description":"Biologist","id_on_source":"MauriceElphick","tweeter_id":"1929559368","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":209},"tweet_id":"799650804894433280"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Clocks_n_crabs\/statuses\/799707223161192453","license":"gnip","rt":["MauriceElphick"],"citation_ids":[13797276],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T20:13:54+00:00","author":{"name":"David Wilcockson","url":"http:\/\/www.aber.ac.uk\/en\/ibers\/staff\/dqw\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000769807372\/0611ac3fd87153d5413e0e6ee8f362b2_normal.jpeg","description":"Crustacean biologist, circadian and tidal rhythms, crab moulting","id_on_source":"Clocks_n_crabs","tweeter_id":"2207073001","geo":{"lt":52.5,"ln":-3.5,"country":"GB"},"followers":425},"tweet_id":"799707223161192453"}]}}
