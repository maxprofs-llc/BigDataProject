To explore whether mutated PTP1B is involved in human carcinogenesis, we have sequenced PTP1B cDNAs from human tumors and found splice mutations in ~20% of colon and thyroid tumors. The PTP1B\u0394E6 mutant expressed in these two tumor types and another PTP1B\u0394E5 mutant expressed in colon tumor were studied in more detail. Although PTP1B\u0394E6 revealed no phosphatase activity compared with wild-type PTP1B and the PTP1B\u0394E5 mutant, its expression induced oncogenic transformation of rat fibroblasts without Src activation, indicating that it involved signaling pathways independent of Src. The transformed cells were tumourigenic in nude mice, suggesting that the PTP1B\u0394E6 affected other molecule(s) in the human tumors. These observations may provide a novel therapeutic target for colon and thyroid cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wenhan Mei","Kemin Wang","Jian Huang","Xinmin Zheng"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0166538","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T16:41:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1479487297,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166538"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0166538&type=printable","pmid":"27855221","pubdate":"2016-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0166538","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Cell Transformation by PTP1B Truncated Mutants Found in Human Colon and Thyroid Tumors","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-transformation-ptp1b-truncated-mutants-found-human-colon-thyroid-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7711682,"mean":6.6148164461077,"rank":5831211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1040839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7711682,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248042,"mean":12.149040940812,"rank":170520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":47763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248042,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109541,"mean":10.264499068834,"rank":79728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":17177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109541,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3745,"mean":11.485737713675,"rank":2623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3745,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AHA1R\/statuses\/799653798771826689","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13797509],"posted_on":"2016-11-18T16:41:37+00:00","author":{"name":"\u262c Richard Allen","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/900084508854108161\/4bhBJekI_normal.jpg","description":"#IamRomani #Palestine #Libya #Bahrain #Educator American in Indonesia.
