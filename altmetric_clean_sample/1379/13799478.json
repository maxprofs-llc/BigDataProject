At study end, improvements in SPPB score and gait speed were not significantly greater in men receiving cholecalciferol than in those receiving placebo. No differences were found in adverse events or numbers of falls.\nDaily cholecalciferol 4,000 IU for 9 months resulted in significant increases in 25(OH)D concentrations, but achieving these higher levels did not result in improvements in SPPB score or gait speed. These data do not support prescribing vitamin D supplements to older sedentary men to prevent physical function decline.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Levis, Silvina","G\u00f3mez\u2010Mar\u00edn, Orlando","G\u00f3mez-Mar\u00edn, Orlando"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.14510","first_seen_on":"2016-11-18T18:38:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-5415"],"journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1482185218,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14510\/abstract;jsessionid=9900487996411818ADE4575E45802825.f03t03","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27861700\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.14510\/pdf","pmid":"27861700","pubdate":"2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Vitamin D and Physical Function in Sedentary Older Men","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vitamin-d-physical-function-sedentary-older-men"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":3919663,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3789024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256235,"mean":12.084057509932,"rank":129682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117757,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256235,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3612,"mean":12.499417889781,"rank":2834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3612,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147,"mean":43.113506849315,"rank":119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
