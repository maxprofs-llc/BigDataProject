This paper presents a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline findings from a longitudinal study.\nUse of time was measured using the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (MARCA), administered via computer-assisted phone interview. Activity patterns were described, and compared on the basis of sex, education and health status.\nThe main activities undertaken were sleep (mean 466min\/day), work (mean 233min\/day) and chores (mean 160min\/day), with little time spent on physical activity (mean 13min\/day). Women spent more time doing chores (p<0.001) while men spent more time on vigorous activities (p<0.001). Participants with \"fair\" health spent less time on inside chores (p=0.05) and grooming (p=0.02) than healthier participants.\nHealthy lifestyle interventions for older workers should aim to increase physical activity levels by targeting specific activities, depending on sex and health status.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003078","authors":["Judy A.
