For all clinical placements, student assessment mark, year of study, type of placement and placement location were collected. Placement location was then classified using the Modified Monash Model (MMM) categories: one (most metropolitan) to seven (most remote).\nOver the 12 year period of the study 3964 placements were completed. Between 2003 and 2005 the average proportion of clinical placements occurring in metropolitan areas (MMM1) was 78% and in rural areas (MMM categories 3-6) was 22%. In 2014 these proportions had changed to 59% (MMM1) and 40% (MMM3-6). There were significant differences in clinical placement grades between MMM1 and all other categories except MMM2, with lower assessment marks in MMM1 than other categories.\nThe changing distribution of physiotherapy clinical placements may be reflective of increasing student numbers and greater efforts to support students completing rural and remote placements. This change may lead to a positive effect on the rural and remote physiotherapy workforce. Further research is required to determine the specific training and support needs of students and clinical educators in rural and remote settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000236f","authors":["Johnston, Catherine","Newstead, Clint","Sanderson, Michael","Wakely, Luke","Osmotherly, Peter"],"doi":"10.1111\/ajr.12302","endpage":"93","first_seen_on":"2016-05-20T03:26:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1440-1584","10385282"],"issue":"2","journal":"Australian Journal of Rural Health","last_mentioned_on":1492514995,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajr.12302\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/ajr.12302#.V2mtyn0uetk.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajr.12302\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ajr.12302\/pdf","pmid":"27184770","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["nursing","publichealth"],"title":"The changing landscape of physiotherapy student clinical placements: An exploration of geographical distribution and student performance across settings","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changing-landscape-physiotherapy-student-clinical-placements-exploration-geographical-distribution-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082745,"mean":6.8630429413494,"rank":2033569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4939002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082745,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271157,"mean":11.565755439673,"rank":87092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":179998,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271157,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":3.5023905325444,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.6125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
