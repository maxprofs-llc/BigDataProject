Telomere shortening induces DNA damage sensing kinases ATM\/ATR for telomerase recruitment. Yet, whether telomere shortening also governs end protection is poorly understood. Here we discover that yeast ATM\/ATR controls end protection. Rap1 is phosphorylated by Tel1 and Mec1 kinases at serine 731, and this regulation is stimulated by DNA damage and telomere shortening. Compromised Rap1 phosphorylation hampers the interaction between Rap1 and its interacting partner Rif1, which thereby disturbs the end protection. As expected, reduction of Rap1-Rif1 association impairs telomere length regulation and increases telomere-telomere recombination. These results indicate that ATM\/ATR DNA damage checkpoint signal contributes to telomere protection by strengthening the Rap1-Rif1 interaction at short telomeres, and the checkpoint signal oversees both telomerase recruitment and end capping pathways to maintain telomere homeostasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Yang, Chia-Wei","Tseng, Shun-Fu","Yu, Chia-Jung","Chung, Chia-Yu","Chang, Cheng-Yen","Pobiega, Sabrina","Teng, Shu-Chun"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkx503","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T16:35:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0305-1048","1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1496523721,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nar\/article\/3859750\/Telomere-shortening-triggers-a-feedback-loop-to","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nar\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/nar\/gkx503\/3859750\/Telomere-shortening-triggers-a-feedback-loop-to?rss=1&utm_content=buffer4f129&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=manny","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28575419?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/nar\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/nar\/gkx503\/17645126\/gkx503.pdf","pmid":"28575419","pubdate":"2017-06-03T22:01:26+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Telomere shortening triggers a feedback loop to enhance end protection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/telomere-shortening-triggers-feedback-loop-enhance-end-protection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":4.1,"6m":4.1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":1809369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6494233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241158,"mean":12.208130819341,"rank":68148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":172466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241158,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10869,"mean":4.437489694516,"rank":2574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":8268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10869,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":8.0023760683761,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":159,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
