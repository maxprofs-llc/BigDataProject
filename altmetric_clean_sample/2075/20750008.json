Girls (N\u2009=\u2009239) and boys (N\u2009=\u2009248) aged between 13 and 15\u00a0years who were attending school, and girls (N\u2009=\u2009570) aged between 12 and 14\u00a0years who were in treatment for an eating disorder at a specialist eating disorder clinic were assessed on the adolescent version of the EDE-Q.\nThe adolescent version of the EDE-Q demonstrated satisfactory levels of internal consistency. However, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) failed to support the four-factor model of the EDE-Q. Parallel analysis (PA) and subsequent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) suggested that the adolescent version of the EDE-Q comprises one underlying factor in young adolescent girls (both clinical and general population), centred on Dissatisfaction with Shape and Weight. In boys three factors were found: Weight-related Concerns, Body Discomfort and Restraint.\nThe EDE-Q appears to measure different underlying aspects of eating disorder psychopathology in young teenagers compared to adults. The dimensions underlying disordered eating in young girls may become increasingly differentiated with time. There appear to be important gender-based differences in the dimensions underlying the EDE-Q in young teenagers. Therapists should be alert to beliefs that girls have about the importance of shape and weight, while in boys it may be more important to be attentive to how they feel about their bodies in relation to weight.","altmetric_jid":"508ef91d3cf0580434000000","authors":["Emma Fors\u00e9n Mantilla","Andreas Birgeg\u00e5rd","David Clinton"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40337-017-0140-8","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T11:21:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2050-2974"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Eating Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1498722360,"links":["https:\/\/jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40337-017-0140-8","https:\/\/jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s40337-017-0140-8?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s40337-017-0140-8?site=jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC5452401","pmid":"28580141","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Promotion and Disease Prevention","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"19","title":"Factor analysis of the adolescent version of the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q): results from Swedish general population and clinical samples","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factor-analysis-adolescent-version-eating-disorders-examination-questionnaire-edeq-results-swedish-g"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.33,"score_history":{"1y":8.33,"6m":8.33,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.33},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":1084577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7353528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246499,"mean":12.61879883001,"rank":46435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":199939,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246499,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":12.176842553191,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":65.9678,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
