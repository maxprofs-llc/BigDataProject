Nasal cavity was the most common primary site. Most patients presented with T4 disease, received trimodality therapy, and were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).\nMedian follow-up was 6.9 years. Sixteen patients (40%) experienced recurrent disease, 5 local (12.5%), 1 regional (2.5%), and 10 distant (25%). The 5-year overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and locoreginal control (LRC) were 44%, 39%, and 71%, respectively. Patients treated with trimodality therapy had better outcomes compared to single modality therapy. Improved OS was noted with IMRT and with doses \u226560 Gy. The most common cause of death was distant metastasis.\nSNUC is an aggressive malignancy with a high tendency to metastasize. Better outcomes were obtained with a trimodality approach. Modern radiotherapy (RT) techniques and doses\u2009\u2265\u200960 Gy were associated with improved OS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075df","authors":["Gamez, Mauricio E.","Lal, Devyani","Halyard, Michele Y.","Wong, William W.","Vargas, Carlos","Ma, Daniel","Ko, Stephen J.","Foote, Robert L.","Patel, Samir H."],"doi":"10.1002\/hed.24834","first_seen_on":"2017-06-01T14:17:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1043-3074","1097-0347"],"journal":"Head & Neck","last_mentioned_on":1496324648,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28561906?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28561906","pubdate":"2017-06-01T22:03:15+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Outcomes and patterns of failure for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC): The Mayo Clinic Experience","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/outcomes-patterns-failure-sinonasal-undifferentiated-carcinoma-snuc-mayo-clinic-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":7178697,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240559,"mean":12.1317724873,"rank":195757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1389,"mean":2.3343054755043,"rank":1201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1389,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.1734567901235,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/870274767609241600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20756124],"posted_on":"2017-06-01T13:44:08+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"870274767609241600"}]}}
