Involvement of the oral cavity portends a poor prognosis for patients with KS, but the mechanisms for KSHV regulation of the oral tumor microenvironment are largely unknown. Infiltrating fibroblasts are found within KS lesions, and KSHV can establish latent infection within human primary fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo, but contributions for KSHV-infected fibroblasts to the KS microenvironment have not been previously characterized. In the present study, we used Illumina microarray to determine global gene expression changes in KSHV-infected primary human oral fibroblasts (PDLF and HGF). Among significantly altered candidates, we found that a series of interferon-induced genes were strongly up-regulated in these KSHV-infected oral cells. Interestingly, some of these genes in particular ISG15 and ISG20 are required for maintenance of virus latency through regulation of specific KSHV microRNAs. Our data indicate that oral fibroblasts may represent one important host cellular defense component against viral infection, as well as acting as a reservoir for herpesvirus lifelong infection in the oral cavity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Dai, Lu","Bai, Lihua","Lin, Zhen","Qiao, Jing","Yang, Liang","Flemington, Erik K","Zabaleta, Jovanny","Qin, Zhiqiang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.9720","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T15:11:14+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","niaid"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1467400250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27363016?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27363016"],"pmid":"27363016","pubdate":"2014-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Transcriptomic analysis of KSHV-infected primary oral fibroblasts: The role of interferon-induced genes in the latency of oncogenic virus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptomic-analysis-kshvinfected-primary-oral-fibroblasts-role-interferoninduced-genes-latency-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":3955386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3815328,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260731,"mean":11.539813408507,"rank":129895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":120248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260731,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8351,"mean":3.0362244311377,"rank":2153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":5721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8351,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":6.1183058823529,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
