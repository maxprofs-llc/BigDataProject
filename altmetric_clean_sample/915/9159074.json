The isolates were then subjected to PCR based screening for the presence of potential biosynthetic gene clusters. The PCR positive isolate was then analyzed for its inhibitory effect towards fungal and bacterial pathogens. The compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity was purified from large scale and subjected to identification by LC-MS\/MS. The ability of the selected isolate in plant growth enhancement was also done using Vigna radiata seedlings.\nIn the present study, an endophytic bacterium isolated from Capsicum annuum was found to have the phenotypic and genetic basis for broad antimicrobial property. PCR based sequence analysis has resulted in the identification of NRPS, PKS Type I, Iturin, surfactin, DAPG and gacA genes in the selected isolate CaB 5. The bioactivity guided fractionation using column and HPLC purification of bioactive fraction followed by LC-MS\/MS analysis has proved the presence of Surfactin derivatives (M+H(+) - 1008 & 1036) and Iturin (M+H(+) - 1058) as the basis of antimicrobial activity of CaB 5. The isolate was identified as a novel Bacillus sp. because of its low (76%) identity to the reported sequences.\nEndophytes are considered to have the genetic basis for a diverse array of bioactive metabolites which can have significant applications in both pharmaceutical industry and agriculture. The identification of CaB 5 with broad bioactivity and excellent plant growth enhancement on taxonomically distinct plant species as explained in current study and our previous reports highlights its plant probiotic applicability. This proves the potential of the isolate obtained in the study to be used as an excellent plant probiotic formulation. This article is protected by copyright.
