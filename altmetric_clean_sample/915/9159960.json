A recently proposed algorithm for proven and young animals (APY) is an approximation that reduces computing time drastically by dividing genotyped animals into core and non-core animals, with only computations for core animals being time-consuming. We hypothesized that choosing core animals based on representing all generations, minimizing the relatedness within the core group, or maximizing the number of genotyped offspring, would result in greater accuracies of estimated breeding values (EBV).\nWe compared eight different core groups for the three pig breeds DanAvl Duroc, DanAvl Landrace and DanAvl Yorkshire. These eight sparse approximations of the single-step method were evaluated based on correlations of EBV for genotyped animals obtained from the sparse methods with those obtained from the usual version of the single-step method. We used a single-trait model with daily gain as trait.\nFor core groups that distributed animals across generations, correlations for genotyped animals (from 0.977 to 0.989) were higher than for those that did not distribute core animals across generations (from 0.934 to 0.956). For core groups that maximized the number of genotyped offspring, correlations for genotyped animals (from 0.983 to 0.989) were higher than for other core groups (from 0.934 to 0.981). There was no clear association between low relatedness within the core group and accuracy of approximations.\nWe found that for core groups that represent all generations and that maximize the number of genotyped offspring, accurate approximations of EBV were obtained. However, we did not find a clear association between accuracy and relatedness within the core group. For the APY method, this is the first study that reports systematic criteria for the creation of core groups that result in more accurate EBV than a similar-sized random core group. Random core groups only ensure across-generation representation. Therefore, we recommend choosing a core group that represents all generations and that maximizes the number of genotyped offspring for single-step genomic evaluation using the APY method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000820","authors":["Ostersen, Tage","Christensen, Ole F","Madsen, Per","Henryon, Mark"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12711-016-0227-8","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T16:34:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1297-9686"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genetics Selection Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1467371715,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27357825?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4926299","pmid":"27357825","pubdate":"2016-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","genetics"],"title":"Sparse single-step method for genomic evaluation in pigs","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sparse-singlestep-method-genomic-evaluation-pigs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":4186624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2226369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260731,"mean":11.54003643616,"rank":141618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260731,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":2.6504983388704,"rank":154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.6607142857143,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
