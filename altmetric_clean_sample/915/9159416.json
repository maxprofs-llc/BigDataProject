We aimed at investigating the effectiveness and safety of add-on EVT after IV tPA in AIS patients with ICAO.\nBetween March 2010 and March 2013, 3,689 consecutive ischemic stroke patients who were hospitalized within 4.5 h of onset were identified using a prospective stroke registry at 11 centers in Korea. Among them, patients with persistent ICAO after receiving IV tPA and whose 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was available were finally enrolled. A propensity score analysis with inverse-probability of treatment weighting was used to eliminate baseline imbalances between those receiving add-on EVT and IV tPA alone.\nAmong 264 patients enrolled in this study (mean age 71.4; male 56.4%; median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score 15), 117 (44.3%) received add-on EVT. The add-on EVT group had a higher frequency of favorable outcome on the mRS \u22642 (35.0 vs. 18.4%; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.79; 95% CI 1.66-4.67) and lower mortality (17.9 vs. 35.4%; aOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13-0.42) at 3 months, when compared to the IV tPA-alone group. Add-on EVT did not significantly increase the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage (5.1 vs. 4.1%; aOR 1.01; 95% CI 0.37-2.70). The rate of successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade \u22652b) in the add-on EVT group was 69.2%.\nCompared to an IV tPA alone, add-on EVT can improve clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic ICAO within 4.5 h of onset without a significant increase of symptomatic hemorrhage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024d6","authors":["Hong, Jeong-Ho","Sohn, Sung-Il","Kang, Jihoon","Jang, Min Uk","Kim, Beom Joon","Han, Moon-Ku","Park, Tai Hwan","Park, Sang-Soon","Lee, Kyung Bok","Lee, Byung-Chul","Yu, Kyung-Ho","Oh, Mi Sun","Cha, Jae Kwan","Kim, Dae Hyun","Lee, Jun","Lee, Soo Joo","Ko, Youngchai","Kim, Jae Guk","Park, Jong-Moo","Kang, Kyusik","Cho, Yong-Jin","Hong, Keun-Sik","Cho, Ki-Hyun","Kim, Joon-Tae","Choi, Jay Chol","Lee, Juneyoung","Lee, Ji-Sung","Gorelick, Philip B","Bae, Hee-Joon"],"doi":"10.1159\/000447599","endpage":"394","first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T15:55:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1421-9786","1015-9770"],"issue":"5-6","journal":"Cerebrovascular Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1467369564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27359223?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27359223","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"387","subjects":["brain"],"title":"Endovascular Treatment in Patients with Persistent Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion after Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator: A Clinical Effectiveness Study","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endovascular-treatment-patients-persistent-internal-carotid-artery-occlusion-after-intravenous-tissu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7974292,"mean":6.7330879653071,"rank":6900452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7974292,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260731,"mean":11.540057339009,"rank":218862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260731,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":490,"mean":2.1694233128834,"rank":375,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":490,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.3394117647059,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/748828346180521988","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9159416],"posted_on":"2016-07-01T10:39:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"748828346180521988"}]}}
