In addition to their bactericidal activity they bind lipid A and neutralize the biological effects of bacterial endotoxin. We have studied the three available polymyxin preparations: polymyxin B sulphate (PB), colistin sulphate (CS) and colistin sulphomethate sodium (CMS), and compared their endotoxin binding capacity at equivalent therapeutic dosage. Each polymyxin was bound to a column of Sepharose 4B and challenged with 5 micrograms of endotoxin from Escherichia coli O127:B8. Recovery of endotoxin in the eluate was measured by a quantitative Limulus lysate microassay. PB and CS bound 94% of the challenge dose, CMS 89% and the control column (Sepharose alone) 24%. These results suggest that parenteral CMS (the least toxic polymyxin) retains useful anti-endotoxin capacity, and that in neutropenic patients, oral polymyxin may exert both anti-endotoxin and antimicrobial effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f61000597d","authors":["Rogers, M J","Cohen, J"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-01T14:25:28+00:00","issns":["0300-8126"],"issue":"2","journal":"Infection","last_mentioned_on":1465124359,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3011678"],"pmid":"3011678","pubdate":"1986-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Comparison of the binding of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin by polymyxin B sulphate, colistin sulphate and colistin sulphomethate sodium.","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":6804098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259435,"mean":11.524333233115,"rank":218276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259435,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":513,"mean":2.9926875,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9107142857143,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Comparison of the binding of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin by polymyxin B sulphate, colistin...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1009673259129631&id=986515058112118","license":"public","citation_ids":[9157616],"posted_on":"2016-06-05T10:59:19+00:00","summary":"\u00bb Collection Folder \u00ab\n\n----------\nPolymyxin E (Colistin) and Polymyxin B\n---------- \n\n1.
