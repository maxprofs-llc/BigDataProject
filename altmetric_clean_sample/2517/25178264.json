FD-OCT was performed before and after each procedure during percutaneous coronary intervention and at 6 months of follow-up.\nClinical characteristics and baseline FD-OCT findings were comparable between the two groups. No patient required stent implantation because of low-pressure DCB-related dissections. In the acute phase, the DCB distributed paclitaxel to the vessel wall without increasing dissections. The DCB did not reduce the neointimal area by itself. At 6 months, more dissections healed in the DCB group (-4.5\u00b12.3 vs. -2.7\u00b11.3, P=0.02). The DCB group showed less change in the neointimal area (-0.04\u00b10.92 vs. 1.06\u00b11.57\u2009mm, P=0.03).\nThe low-pressure DCB was not intended to expand the lumen, but instead to attach paclitaxel to the vessel wall by using FD-OCT examination. The DCB reduced the number of dissections and prevented neointimal proliferation during the mid-term follow-up.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000584a","authors":["Fukushima, Taku","Ashikaga, Takashi","Yoshikawa, Shunji","Hatano, Yu","Ueshima, Daisuke","Yamamoto, Takanobu","Yasuhiro, Maejima","Isobe, Mitsuaki"],"doi":"10.1097\/mca.0000000000000552","first_seen_on":"2017-09-13T06:39:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0954-6928","1473-5830"],"journal":"Coronary artery disease","last_mentioned_on":1505284743,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_drug_coated_balloon_on_stent_restenosis,.99155.pdf?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/9000\/00000\/Effect_of_drug_coated_balloon_on_stent_restenosis,.99155.pdf","pmid":"28902718","pubdate":"2017-09-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Effect of drug-coated balloon on stent restenosis, neointimal proliferation, and coronary dissection","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/coronary-artery\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Effect_of_drug_coated_balloon_on_stent_restenosis,.99155.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409376,"mean":7.0790526953473,"rank":6381672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1141425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409376,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125613,"mean":11.722041461007,"rank":87977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125613,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":722,"mean":1.4049153952843,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":722,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.88076923076923,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CoronaryArteryD\/statuses\/907856133209108480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25178264],"posted_on":"2017-09-13T06:39:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Coronary Artery D","url":"http:\/\/www.coronary-artery.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2328404220\/MCA_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Publishing original research with a clinical emphasis that contributes to the understanding of coronary artery disease.","id_on_source":"CoronaryArteryD","tweeter_id":"614393222","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":339},"tweet_id":"907856133209108480"}]}}
