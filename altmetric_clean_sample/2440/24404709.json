Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of RC pathology were prospectively enrolled at the time of their surgical indication for RC repair. Each patient was asked to fill out the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment Form, Marx Shoulder Activity Scale, Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function and General Health (SF-36 PF and GH), EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), PROMIS PF CAT, and PROMIS UE.\u00a0Correlation was defined as excellent (>0.7), excellent-good (0.61-0.7), good (0.4-0.6), and poor (0.2-0.3).\nPatient data were collected from January 2015 to September 2015. No patients were excluded from participation in the study. In 82 patients with preoperative RC pathology, the PROMIS UE showed excellent correlation with American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment Form (r\u00a0= 0.77, P < .01), WORC (r\u00a0= 0.73, P < .01), and the EQ-5D (r\u00a0= 0.73, P < .01); there was excellent-good correlation with the SF-36 PF (r\u00a0= .66, P < .01) and PROMIS PF CAT (r\u00a0=\u00a0.70, P < .01). The PROMIS PF CAT showed excellent correlation with the SF-36 PF (r\u00a0= 0.77, P < .01); there was excellent-good correlation with EQ-5D (r\u00a0= 0.65, P < .01) and WORC (r\u00a0= 0.61, P < .01). There were no significant floor or ceiling effects using the PROMIS UE item bank or PROMIS PF CAT.\nWe report that in a patient population with preoperative RC pathology, the PROMIS UE and PROMIS CAT are valid patient-reported outcome alternatives that have high correlation with traditional shoulder and upper extremity patient-reported outcomes. We find a decreased question burden using the PROMIS PF CAT. We find no significant floor or ceiling effects present in the PROMIS UE or PROMIS PF CAT.\nLevel II, prospective diagnostic study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b2c","authors":["Anthony, Chris A.","Glass, Natalie","Hancock, Kyle","Bollier, Matt","Hettrich, Carolyn M.","Wolf, Brian R."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.arthro.2017.04.018","first_seen_on":"2017-08-27T19:21:13+00:00","issns":["0749-8063","07498063"],"journal":"Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic & Related Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1503745200,"links":["http:\/\/www.arthroscopyjournal.org\/article\/S0749-8063(17)30390-0\/fulltext"],"pmid":"28655475","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Preoperative Performance of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System in Patients With Rotator Cuff Pathology","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-performance-patientreported-outcomes-measurement-information-system-patients-rotator-cu-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167091,"mean":12.602608211144,"rank":136648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167091,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1529,"mean":5.8900876963351,"rank":1450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1529,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":6.9213333333333,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
