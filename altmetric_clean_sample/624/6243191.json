Outside the U.S.A., the ECD definition remains the one used without questioning whether such a graft allocation criteria is worldwide valid.\nWe performed a meta-analysis to quantify the differences between ECD and Standard Criteria Donor (SCD) transplants. We paid particular attention to select studies in which the methodology was appropriate and we took into consideration the geographical area.\nThirty-two publications were included. Only 5 studies, all from the U.S.A., reported confounder-adjusted hazard ratios comparing the survival outcomes between ECD and SCD kidney transplant recipients. These 5 studies confirmed that ECD recipients seemed to have poorer prognosis. From 29 studies reporting appropriate survival curves, we estimated the 5-year pooled non-adjusted survivals for ECD and SCD recipients. The relative differences between the two groups were lower in Europe than in North-America, particularly for death-censored graft failure.\nIt is of primary importance to propose appropriate studies for external validation of the ECD criteria in non-US kidney transplant recipients.
