The time for the electronic physician order was the largest. (2) For specific tasks, the mean completion times of the 2 hospital EHR systems spent on recording, modifying and searching (RMS) the medication orders were similar to those for the RMS radioactive tests; the mean time spent on the RMS laboratory test orders were much less. (3) There were 85 usability problems identified in the 2 hospital EHR systems.\nIn Chinese EHRs, a substantial amount of time is required to complete tasks relevant to MU targets and many preventable usability problems can be discovered. The task completion time of the 2 Chinese EHR systems was a little shorter than in the 5 reported US EHR systems, while the differences in smoking status and CPOE tasks were obvious; one main reason for these differences was the use of structured data entry.\nThe efficiency of Chinese and US EHRs was not significantly different. The key to improving the efficiency of both systems lies in expediting the Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) task. Many usability problems can be identified using heuristic assessments and improved by corresponding actions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b70","authors":["Xu, Lufei","Wen, Dong","Zhang, Xingting","Lei, Jianbo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijmedinf.2016.02.008","endpage":"42","first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T13:09:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-8243","13865056"],"journal":"International Journal of Medical Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1458392119,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26980357"],"pmid":"26980357","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"32","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Assessing and comparing the usability of Chinese EHRs used in two Peking University hospitals to EHRs used in the US: A method of RUA","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-comparing-usability-chinese-ehrs-used-two-peking-university-hospitals-ehrs-used-method-rua"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":5606349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278398,"mean":10.891475094918,"rank":195477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":43096,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278398,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":653,"mean":4.032963190184,"rank":520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":653,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.7203076923077,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
