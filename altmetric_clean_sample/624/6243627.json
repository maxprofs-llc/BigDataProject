The complete genome sequence of P.fragi P121 was carried out using the PacBio RS\u2161 platform. The genome contains a circular chromosome with 5,101,809bp. The genome sequence suggests that the P121 exhibited the ability of degradation of toxic compounds. Genome sequencing information provides the genetic basis for the analysis of toxic compounds and the mechanism of extreme environmental adaptation of the strain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd3","authors":["Yanzhen, Mei","Yang, Liu","Xiangting, Xu","Wei, He","Chuanchao, Dai"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiotec.2016.03.019","first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T17:56:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4863","01681656"],"journal":"Journal of Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1458410164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26988396?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26988396","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Complete genome sequence of a bacterium Pseudomonas fragi P121, a strain with degradation of toxic compounds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genome-sequence-bacterium-pseudomonas-fragi-p121-strain-degradation-toxic-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":3808351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2075235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278398,"mean":10.891496287675,"rank":151149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":98837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278398,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":901,"mean":3.2062822222222,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":901,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":9.9638356164384,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
