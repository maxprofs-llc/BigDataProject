By focally puffing kainate, GABA and glycine at amacrine cell processes in the inner plexiform layer, it was determined that the cell's glutamate receptors were located in a confined region of the processes near the soma, while glycine and GABA receptors were located throughout the processes. Likewise, similar techniques in conjunction with voltage steps demonstrated that voltage-gated sodium channels were located throughout the cell and were shown to generate sodium-dependent spikes, while only the processes contained voltage-gated calcium channels. These results suggest that this form of transient amacrine cell collects its excitatory synaptic inputs in a region confined to a central annular region near the soma, that the signal is actively propagated throughout its processes by voltage-gated sodium channels and that calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release of glycine from this neuron can occur throughout its processes. Thus, excitatory signals are collected in the processes near the soma, inhibitory signals throughout the processes and excitation is probably propagated throughout the processes of the amacrine cell.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["Maguire, G"],"doi":"10.1098\/rspb.1999.0734","endpage":"992","first_seen_on":"2016-03-20T18:25:45+00:00","issns":["0962-8452","1471-2954"],"issue":"1423","journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1458498287,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10380682"],"pmcid":"PMC1689933","pmid":"10380682","pubdate":"1999-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"987","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Spatial heterogeneity and function of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in retinal amacrine neurons","type":"article","volume":"266","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spatial-heterogeneity-function-voltage-ligandgated-ion-channels-retinal-amacrine-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7414256,"mean":6.4482247041637,"rank":1781167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4648545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7414256,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278080,"mean":10.927223530004,"rank":88418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":184368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278080,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5531,"mean":21.610811934901,"rank":3613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5531,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":39.361225,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
