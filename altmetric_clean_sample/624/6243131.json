It aimed to measure gender and sexual (GenSex) prejudice pre- and post-intervention in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. A total of 307 health practitioners from southern Brazil enrolled and completed the follow-up assessment. The intervention had significant effects, varying across traditionally high prejudiced groups. State- and street-level continuous prejudice reduction policies are suggested.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Costa, Angelo Brandelli","Pase, Paola Fagundes","de Camargo, Eric Seger","Guaranha, Camila","Caetano, Adriano Henrique","Kveller, Daniel","da Rosa Filho, Heitor Thom\u00e9","Catelan, Ramiro Figueiredo","Koller, Silvia Helena","Nardi, Henrique Caetano","Angelo Brandelli Costa","Paola Fagundes Pase","Eric Seger de Camargo","Camila Guaranha","Adriano Henrique Caetano","Daniel Kveller","Heitor Thom\u00e9 da Rosa Filho","Ramiro Figueiredo Catelan","Silvia Helena Koller","Henrique Caetano Nardi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359105316628748","endpage":"368","first_seen_on":"2016-03-19T13:57:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1461-7277","1359-1053"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Health Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1483904089,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26987830?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1359105316628748","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26987830"],"pmid":"26987830","pubdate":"2016-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"356","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Effectiveness of a multidimensional web-based intervention program to change Brazilian health practitioners attitudes toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-multidimensional-webbased-intervention-program-change-brazilian-health-practitioners-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019832,"mean":6.784478957969,"rank":1920632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6061289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019832,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283348,"mean":11.059196970499,"rank":86766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":195174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283348,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1295,"mean":7.0236661514683,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1295,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":4.4937066666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
