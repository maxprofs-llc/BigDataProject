The study group comprised 60 consecutive patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer who underwent PET\/MRI before treatment. The imaging biomarkers were the minimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin), choline levels, standardized uptake values, metabolic tumour volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the tumours. The relationships between these biomarkers and clinical TNM stage were evaluated using the Pearson test and the Mann-Whitney U test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate accuracy. The correlation between the imaging biomarker and progression-free survival (PFS) was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\nADCmin was significantly lower in N1 and TNM stage 3+ tumours. Choline levels significantly higher in T4 tumours. TLG was significantly higher in T4, N1 and TNM stage 3+ tumours. MTV was significantly higher in T4, N1, M1, and TNM stage 3+ tumours (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). The MTV\/ADCmin ratio exhibited the highest AUROC for predicting T4, N1, M1, and advanced TNM stages tumours, and was an independent predictor of PFS (P\u2009=\u20090.018) after adjustment for age, sex, tumour size and stage.\nThe imaging biomarkers from integrated PET\/MRI may predict clinical stage and PFS in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002843","authors":["Chen, Bang-Bin","Tien, Yu-Wen","Chang, Ming-Chu","Cheng, Mei-Fang","Chang, Yu-Ting","Wu, Chih-Horng","Chen, Xin-Jia","Kuo, Ting-Chun","Yang, Shih-Hung","Shih, I-Lun","Lai, Hong-Shiee","Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang","Bang-Bin Chen","Yu-Wen Tien","Ming-Chu Chang","Mei-Fang Cheng","Yu-Ting Chang","Chih-Horng Wu","Xin-Jia Chen","Ting-Chun Kuo","Shih-Hung Yang","I-Lun Shih","Hong-Shiee Lai","Tiffany Ting-Fang Shih"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00259-016-3356-y","first_seen_on":"2016-03-20T10:15:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1619-7089","1619-7070"],"journal":"European Journal of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging","last_mentioned_on":1470226030,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26993317?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00259-016-3356-y"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00259-016-3356-y.pdf","pmid":"26993317","pubdate":"2016-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"\u2009PET\/MRI in pancreatic and periampullary cancer: correlating diffusion-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopy and glucose metabolic activity with clinical stage and prognosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/petmri-pancreatic-periampullary-cancer-correlating-diffusionweighted-imaging-mr-spectroscopy-glucose"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8160820,"mean":6.9113685834654,"rank":3516744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4528252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8160820,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283603,"mean":11.162871467761,"rank":114787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":163668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283603,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1011,"mean":2.1480653465347,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1011,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":2.821875,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
