A rare type of single coronary artery was identified during the Coronary angiogram. The left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCX) had originated from the proximal segment of right coronary artery along with significant lesion in LCX. Computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiogram confirmed the origin and course following which successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was done to LCX. The incidence of this type of coronary anomaly is 0.004%. We emphasize the importance of having a CT coronary angiogram to identify the course before the intervention. The procedural risk during PCI in patients with single coronary ostium is high. Moreover, the angulation and course of the culprit artery also pose a challenge. Good coaxial guide support by using an appropriate guiding catheter is the key to success.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdac","authors":["Budanur, Srinivas C","Singh, Yadvinder","Vilvanathan, Vinoth K","Reddy, Babu T","Mahadevappa, Nagesh C","Nanjappa, Manjunath C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ihj.2015.06.032","endpage":"S48","first_seen_on":"2016-03-21T07:11:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0019-4832","00194832"],"journal":"Indian heart journal","last_mentioned_on":1458544288,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26995431"],"pmid":"26995431","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"S47","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Percutaneous coronary intervention in a rare variety of single coronary artery","type":"article","volume":"67 Suppl 3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-coronary-intervention-rare-variety-single-coronary-artery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7419920,"mean":6.4520289205274,"rank":6424160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7419920,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276995,"mean":10.964797114739,"rank":234234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276995,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260,"mean":2.1097683397683,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":2.3357142857143,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/711812453781401600","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6248707],"posted_on":"2016-03-21T07:11:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"711812453781401600"}]}}
