Compared with VKAs, DOACs were more commonly prescribed in patients with a history of stroke and in patients with a higher thromboembolic risk. The study scores were as follows: SAT-Q: 63.8 \u00b1 17.8; EQ-5D-3L total score: 75.6 \u00b1 20.9; visual analog scale: 63.1 \u00b1 20.6; ACTS Burdens: 51.8 \u00b1 8.4 and ACTS Benefits: 11.9 \u00b1 2.4. The ACTS Burdens score and ACTS Benefits score were higher with DOACs than with VKAs (54.83 \u00b1 6.11 vs 49.50 \u00b1 9.15; p < 0.001 and 12.36 \u00b1 2.34 vs 11.48 \u00b1 2.46; p < 0.001 respectively).\nNVAF patients treated with oral anticoagulants had many comorbidities and a high thromboembolic risk. Satisfaction and quality of life with oral anticoagulants were high, although they were both better with DOACs than with VKAs.","altmetric_jid":"5587ebc22a83ee287f8b4570","authors":["Ma del Mar Contreras Muruaga","Jos\u00e9 Vivancos","Gemma Reig","Ayoze Gonz\u00e1lez","Pere Cardona","Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa Ram\u00edrez-Moreno","Joan Mart\u00ed","Carmen Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez","on behalf of the ALADIN Study Investigators"],"doi":"10.2217\/cer-2016-0078","first_seen_on":"2017-04-12T13:00:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-6305","2042-6313"],"journal":"Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research","last_mentioned_on":1493677454,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/cer-2016-0078"],"pmid":"28353372","publisher":" Future Medicine Ltd London, UK ","title":"Satisfaction, quality of life and perception of patients regarding burdens and benefits of vitamin K antagonists compared with direct oral anticoagulants in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/satisfaction-quality-life-perception-patients-regarding-burdens-benefits-vitamin-k-antagonists-compa-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8157083,"mean":6.8932935902745,"rank":4330496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2258010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8157083,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240896,"mean":12.952902941115,"rank":135657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":83444,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240896,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":3.0845714285714,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.5754,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
