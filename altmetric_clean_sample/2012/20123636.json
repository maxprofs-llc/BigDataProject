A remaining key question is how many hydration shells are affected by ion-induced network perturbations. We disclose that theoretical THz difference spectra of aqueous salt solutions can be deciphered in terms of only a handful of dipolar auto- and cross-correlations - including the second solvation shell. This emphasizes the importance of cross-correlations being often neglected in multi-component models. Analogously, experimental THz responses of simple ions can be deciphered in a similar way. Dramatic intensity cancellations due to large positive and negative contributions are found to effectively shift intensity maxima. Thus, THz spectroscopy provides an unprecedented view on the details of hydration dynamics which can be understood by a combination of experiment and theory.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dea","authors":["Philipp Schienbein","Gerhard Schwaab","Harald Forbert","Martina Havenith","Dominik Marx"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpclett.7b00713","first_seen_on":"2017-05-14T05:12:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-7185"],"journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1494738737,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpclett.7b00713"],"pmid":"28488865","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"Correlations in the Solute-Solvent Dynamics Reach Beyond the First Hydration Shell of Ions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlations-solutesolvent-dynamics-reach-beyond-first-hydration-shell-ions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":7099872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238431,"mean":12.366407582938,"rank":193928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238431,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2413,"mean":3.2982728026534,"rank":1491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2413,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":5.7200882352941,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
