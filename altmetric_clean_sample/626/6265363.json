Readers' eye movement patterns were used to study online sentence comprehension. Effects of background speech were primarily seen in rereading time. In Experiment 1, foreign-language background speech did not disrupt sentence processing. Experiment 2 demonstrated robust disruption in reading as a result of semantically and syntactically anomalous scrambled background speech preserving normal sentence-like intonation. Scrambled speech that was constructed from the text to-be read did not disrupt reading more than scrambled speech constructed from a different, semantically unrelated text. Experiment 3 showed that scrambled speech exacerbated the syntactic complexity effect more than coherent background speech, which also interfered with reading. Experiment 4 demonstrated that both semantically and syntactically anomalous speech produced no more disruption in reading than semantically anomalous but syntactically correct background speech. The pattern of results is best explained by a semantic account that stresses the importance of similarity in semantic processing, but not similarity in semantic content, between the reading task and background speech.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jukka Hy\u00f6n\u00e4","Miia Ekholm"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0152133","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T22:54:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1460593654,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152133&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152133","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0152133"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0152133.PDF","pmid":"27003410","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0152133","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Background Speech Effects on Sentence Processing during Reading: An Eye Movement Study","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/background-speech-effects-sentence-processing-during-reading-eye-movement-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":1272122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6275210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277457,"mean":11.002929257251,"rank":64919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":212331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277457,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107670,"mean":10.192665725511,"rank":24515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":83026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107670,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5398,"mean":12.916925328886,"rank":1433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":3957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5398,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
