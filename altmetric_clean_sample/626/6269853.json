This attempt at simplification, while sometimes necessary, may explain some of the difficulties in translating basic science findings to the clinical and epidemiological data on stress and stress-related disorders. In a symposium at the 2015 International Society for Psychoneuroendocrinology meeting in Glasgow, UK, a series of speakers explored \"The many pathways to plasticity in the stress system\", specifically focusing on variables that are in many cases eliminated from studies of stress in order to provide increased experimental control. Specifically, four speakers tackled the complex contributions of Sex, Development, and Environment in stress research, providing evidence from published and unpublished work from their own laboratories demonstrating that in our race for simplicity in experimentation, the stories we tell become all the more complex.
