However, OSA can also be seen in non-obese patients with a small maxilla and\/or mandible, as well as in all obese patients with such features. Thus, we hypothesized that regional factors, oropharyngeal crowding associated with fat deposition, and maxillomandibular enclosure size closely related to the severity of OSA.\nA total of 703 male Japanese subjects, who were classified into obese (body mass index [BMI] \u2265 30 kg\/m(2); n=158) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg\/m(2); n=545) groups, were enrolled. Using lateral cephalometric analysis, we measured the tongue size (TG), lower face cage (LFC), and TG\/LFC ratio (i.e. oropharyngeal crowding) to evaluate the state of upper airway crowding. The correlations between these cephalometric measurements and BMI, age, and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were evaluated.\nIn obese subjects, the TG\/LFC ratio, BMI, and TG positively correlated with AHI, whereas, in non-obese subjects, age, BMI, and TG\/LFC significantly correlated with AHI. Subsequent stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the variables associated with AHI differed between obese and non-obese OSA subjects, although BMI and TG\/LFC were significantly associated with AHI in both groups. Especially, the contribution of TG\/LFC to AHI was larger than that of BMI in the obese group.\nOropharyngeal crowding is a local anatomic factor that independently relates to the severity of OSA in both obese and non-obese patients; the more crowded the upper airway, the more severe the OSA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["Ito, Eiki","Tsuiki, Satoru","Maeda, Keiko","Okajima, Isa","Inoue, Yuichi","Eiki Ito","Satoru Tsuiki","Keiko Maeda","Isa Okajima","Yuichi Inoue"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chest.2016.03.005","endpage":"352","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T19:08:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1931-3543","00123692","0012-3692"],"issue":"2","journal":"CHEST","last_mentioned_on":1471618202,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26997240","http:\/\/journal.publications.chestnet.org\/article.aspx?articleid=2506754&resultClick=3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.publications.chestnet.org\/data\/Journals\/CHEST\/935529\/03005.pdf","pmid":"26997240","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American College of Chest Physicians","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"346","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Oropharyngeal crowding closely relates to aggravation of obstructive sleep apnea","type":"article","volume":"150","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oropharyngeal-crowding-closely-relates-aggravation-osa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":1037709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7208322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282220,"mean":11.233070076784,"rank":49995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":232110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282220,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6026,"mean":7.4824630705394,"rank":993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6026,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170,"mean":10.537396449704,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":11,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Ph.
