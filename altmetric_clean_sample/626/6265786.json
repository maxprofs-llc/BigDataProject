TXRF and TXRF-XANES are valuable tools for elemental determination and speciation, especially where sample amounts are limited (<1\u2005mg) and concentrations are low (ng\u2005ml(-1) to \u00b5g\u2005ml(-1)). TXRF requires a well defined geometry regarding the reflecting surface of a sample carrier and the synchrotron beam. The newly installed chamber allows for reliable sample positioning, remote sample changing and evacuation of the fluorescence beam path. The chamber was successfully used showing accurate determination of elemental amounts in the certified reference material NIST water 1640. Low limits of detection of less than 100\u2005fg absolute (10\u2005pg\u2005ml(-1)) for Ni were found. TXRF-XANES on different Re species was applied. An unknown species of Re was found to be Re in the +7 oxidation state.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f4b","authors":["Fittschen, U.","Guilherme, A.","B\u00f6ttger, S.","Rosenberg, D.","Menzel, M.","Jansen, W.","Busker, M.","Gotlib, Z.P.","Radtke, M.","Riesemeier, H.","Wobrauschek, P.","Streli, C."],"doi":"10.1107\/s1600577516001995","endpage":"824","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T23:45:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-5775"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (International Union of Crystallography - IUCr)","last_mentioned_on":1481098696,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper_yard?pp5082&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S1600577516001995","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?pp5082&utm_content=bufferbee5b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?pp5082&utm_content=buffer1887f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?pp5082&utm_content=buffer77ea4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?pp5082&utm_content=buffer4b903&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?pp5082"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/s\/issues\/2016\/03\/00\/pp5082\/pp5082.pdf","pmid":"27140163","pubdate":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
