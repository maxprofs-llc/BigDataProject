Megavoltage irradiation is usually the treatment of choice for the management of symptomatic VHs. The current study was conducted to estimate the risk for carcinogenesis from radiotherapy of this benign disease on the basis of the calculated radiation doses to healthy organs.\nThe Monte Carlo N-particle transport code was employed to simulate the irradiation with 6 MV x-rays of a VH presented in the cervical, upper thoracic, lower thoracic, and lumbar spine. The average radiation dose (Dav) received by each critical organ located outside the primarily irradiated area was calculated. Three-dimensional treatment plans were also generated for the VHs occurring at the four different sites of the spinal cord based on patients' computed tomography data. The organ equivalent dose (OED) to each radiosensitive structure, which was partly encompassed by the applied treatment fields, was calculated with the aid of differential dose-volume histograms. The Dav and the OED values were combined with a linear-no-threshold model and a nonlinear mechanistic model, respectively, to estimate the organ-, age-, and gender-specific lifetime attributable risks (LARs) for cancer development. The estimated risks were compared with the respective nominal lifetime intrinsic risks (LIRs) for the unexposed population.\nFor a standard target dose of 34 Gy, the OED varied from 0.39-5.15 Gy by the organ of interest and the irradiation site. The Dav range for the out-of-field organs was 4.9 \u00d7 10(-4) to 0.56 Gy. The LAR for the appearance of malignancies in the partially in-field organs after radiotherapy of male and female patients was (0.08%-1.8%) and (0.09%-1.9%), respectively. These risk values were 1.5-15.5 times lower when compared to the respective LIRs. The lifetime probability for out-of-field cancer induction in irradiated males and females was (2.5 \u00d7 10(-4) to 7.7 \u00d7 10(-2))% and (1.4 \u00d7 10(-4) to 2.6 \u00d7 10(-1))%, respectively. The above risks were one to four orders of magnitude lower than the LIRs.\nThe probability for the development of out-of-field malignancies due to radiotherapy for VHs is trivial with respect to the nominal risk for unexposed population. The respective cancer risks to partially in-field organs are smaller than the nominal probabilities but they should not be considered as inconsiderable. These risks may be taken into account during the follow-up of patients treated for a symptomatic VH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000309b","authors":["Michalis Mazonakis","Antonis Tzedakis","Efrossyni Lyraraki","John Damilakis"],"doi":"10.1118\/1.4944422","first_seen_on":"2016-03-22T17:26:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0094-2405"],"issue":"4","journal":"Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1458684678,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/43\/4\/10.1118\/1.4944422?TRACK=RSS","http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aapm\/journal\/medphys\/43\/4\/10.1118\/1.4944422?TRACK=RSS&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27036581","pubdate":"2016-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Physicists in Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Radiation dose and cancer risk to out-of-field and partially in-field organs from radiotherapy for symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiation-dose-cancer-risk-outoffield-partially-infield-organs-radiotherapy-symptomatic-vertebral-he"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":3604325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3633146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276266,"mean":10.978569163665,"rank":138758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":127107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276266,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2792,"mean":1.8698258688642,"rank":1003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2792,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":2.1192307692308,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1,"VE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/medphyspapers\/statuses\/712329410846834688","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6261029],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T17:25:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Med Phys Papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","description":"New publications in Medical Physics and Radiotherapy.","id_on_source":"medphyspapers","tweeter_id":"2879791906","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":136},"tweet_id":"712329410846834688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aapmHQ\/statuses\/712334563863703552","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6261029],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T17:46:09+00:00","author":{"name":"AAPM HQ","url":"http:\/\/www.aapm.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/414133041435394048\/bkyi2OEJ_normal.jpeg","description":"Official Twitter account for the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM).","id_on_source":"aapmHQ","tweeter_id":"34271917","geo":{"lt":38.80484,"ln":-77.04692,"country":"US"},"followers":6199},"tweet_id":"712334563863703552"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RadioterapiaP\/statuses\/712401293504090112","license":"gnip","rt":["aapmHQ"],"citation_ids":[6261029],"posted_on":"2016-03-22T22:11:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Radioterapia Para\u00edso","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/URRP\/621064727906336?id=621064727906336&sk=likes#!\/pages\/URRP\/621064727906336","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/416781997181513728\/EzFqWw-3_normal.jpeg","description":"Unidad de Radioterapia y Radiocirug\u00eda (URRP).
