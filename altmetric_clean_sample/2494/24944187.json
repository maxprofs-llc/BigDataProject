This study describes a continual cascade nanozyme biosensor for the detection of viable ES based on propidium monoazide (PMA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and Nanozyme-strip. The ompA gene of ES was determined using FITC-modified and BIO-modified primers in LAMP process. LAMP combined with PMA treatment was applied for differentiation from viable and dead state of ES. Then, by using Fe3O4 magnetic as a nanozyme probe, a MNP-based immunochromatographic strip (nanozyme strip) was further employed for amplified signal to allow visual detection and quantification by strip reader. The LAMP products are sandwiched between the anti-FITC and the anti-BIO, and the accumulation of Fe3O4 magnetic enables the visual detection of ES. The 10 CFU\/mL lower limit of biosensor is improved compared with previously reported techniques and is much faster (within 1 hour) and simpler (without specialist facilities). Hence, the developed continual cascade nanozyme biosensor provides a rapid, ultra-sensitive, and simple tool for on-site detection of viable ES.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Zhang, Li","Chen, Yuting","Cheng, Nan","Xu, Yuancong","Huang, Kunlun","Luo, Yunbo","Wang, Peixia","Duan, Demin","Xu, Wentao","Li Zhang","Yuting Chen","Nan Cheng","Yuancong Xu","Kunlun Huang","Yunbo Luo","Peixia Wang","Demin Duan","Wentao Xu"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.7b01266","first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T10:20:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0003-2700","1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1505959998,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28881135?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.7b01266"],"pmid":"28881135","pubdate":"2017-09-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Rapid and ultra-sensitive detection of viable Enterobacter sakazakii by a continual cascade nanozyme biosensor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapid-ultrasensitive-detection-viable-enterobacter-sakazakii-continual-cascade-nanozyme-biosensor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6408560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1148417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155662,"mean":12.083794476459,"rank":109740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":28804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155662,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8019,"mean":3.4366679970067,"rank":5365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":1221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8019,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":4.33682,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
