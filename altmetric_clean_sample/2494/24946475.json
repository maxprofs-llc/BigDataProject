In recent years, they have been believed to be major players in biological processes. However, there is limited understanding of the many lncRNAs' expressions and their clinical significances in gastric cancer.\nQuantitative RT-PCR was performed to investigate the lncRNA expression in gastric cancer. Then, we further explored the potential association between RP11-62F24.2 level and the clinicopathological features in gastric cancer tissue samples.\nThe results showed that RP11-62F24.2 was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues (p < 0.05). Its expression level was significantly correlated with invasion and tumor size.\nThese results indicated that lncRNA RP11-62F24.2 may be a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of gastric cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f06","authors":["Liu, Cuixia","Cao, Bole","Liu, Ni","Zhou, Zhenping","Yang, Guifeng","Zhou, Peng"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-08T11:10:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1433-6510"],"issue":"9","journal":"Clinical Laboratory","last_mentioned_on":1504869006,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28879717?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28879717","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Increased Expression of Long Noncoding RNA RP11-62F24.2 in Gastric Cancer and Its Clinical Significance.","type":"article","volume":"63"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":7249285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123542,"mean":11.934715163387,"rank":100577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123542,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273,"mean":1.3430514705882,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.8,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lncRNA_papers\/statuses\/906112405343657984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24946475],"posted_on":"2017-09-08T11:10:06+00:00","author":{"name":"lncRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/632251582499852288\/nfPQQhIV_normal.png","description":"Bringing you the latest in #lncRNA scientific literature. #lincRNA #longnoncodingRNA #RNA #biochem #pubmed #science","id_on_source":"lncRNA_papers","tweeter_id":"3315333763","geo":{"lt":40.01499,"ln":-105.27055,"country":"US"},"followers":408},"tweet_id":"906112405343657984"}]}}
