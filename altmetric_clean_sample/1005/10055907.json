Here we show that PCs use a multiplexed spike code. Synchrony\/spike time and firing rate encode different information in behaving monkeys during saccadic eye motion tasks. Using the local field potential (LFP) as a probe of local network activity, we found that infrequent pause spikes, which initiated or terminated intermittent pauses in simple spike trains, provide a temporally reliable signal for eye motion onset, with strong phase-coupling to the \u03b2\/\u03b3 band LFP. Concurrently, regularly firing, non-pause spikes were weakly correlated with the LFP, but were crucial to linear encoding of eye movement kinematics by firing rate. Therefore, PC spike trains can simultaneously convey information necessary to achieve precision in both timing and continuous control of motion.","altmetric_jid":"560420b12a83eea5738b4567","authors":["Sungho Hong","Mario Negrello","Marc Junker","Aleksandra Smilgin","Peter Thier","Erik De Schutter"],"doi":"10.7554\/elife.13810","first_seen_on":"2016-07-26T17:58:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2050-084X"],"journal":"eLife","last_mentioned_on":1476413990,"links":["https:\/\/prod.elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e13810#disqus_thread","https:\/\/prod.elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e13810","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.7554\/eLife.13810"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/prod.elifesciences.org\/content\/5\/e13810.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4961467","pmid":"27458803","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications Limited","title":"Multiplexed coding by cerebellar Purkinje neurons","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiplexed-coding-cerebellar-purkinje-neurons"},"altmetric_score":{"score":72.43,"score_history":{"1y":72.43,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":72.43},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7859726,"mean":6.6571533199898,"rank":109399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7750346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7859726,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255415,"mean":11.811450844511,"rank":8036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":247377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255415,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3786,"mean":29.481414002642,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3786,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":298,"mean":41.014269360269,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":298,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
