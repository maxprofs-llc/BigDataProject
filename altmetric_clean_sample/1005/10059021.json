The present invention patent relates to bone- and metal-targeted polymeric nanoparticles for targeting delivery of therapeutic molecules to the pathological tissues in bone or the surgical metal implant-bone tissue interface.\nThe nanoparticles for drug delivery were fabricated via the assembly of amphiphilic polymers, in which the hydrophilic outer layer was minimal to prolong the circulation time, and the hydrophobic insider core was biodegradable and loaded with therapeutic agents. Bone-targeted elements were conjugated on the nanoparticle surface to enhance their affinity to bone and\/or metal implant surface.\nA prolonged, sustained release of therapeutic agents was observed by using the delivery system targeting to bone. The described invention provides a bone-targeted vector to deliver diverse therapeutic agents to bone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c8","authors":["Lin Li"],"doi":"10.1080\/13543776.2016.1212840","endpage":"5","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T00:19:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-7674","1354-3776"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents","last_mentioned_on":1469578760,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/13543776.2016.1212840?ai=1pmzj&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27414194","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","title":"Bone and metal targeted polymeric nanoparticles (US20150125391 A1): a patent evaluation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bone-metal-targeted-polymeric-nanoparticles-us20150125391-a1-patent-evaluation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":7047500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257611,"mean":11.921872916424,"rank":217808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257611,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":526,"mean":1.3726971428571,"rank":320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":526,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.1583333333333,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
