Randomized controlled trials involving carers of people with dementia and comparing multicomponent interventions with usual care were included.\nPooling of all studies demonstrated that multicomponent interventions can reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, reduce carer impact, and reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as well as caregiver upset with these symptoms. We were unable to find a significant difference in the effects of dyadic interventions in comparison with carer focused interventions for these outcomes.\nAlthough effect sizes associated with intervention are small, multicomponent interventions are relatively inexpensive to deliver, acceptable, and widely applicable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c71","authors":["Kate Laver","Rachel Milte","Suzanne Dyer","Maria Crotty"],"doi":"10.1177\/0898264316660414","first_seen_on":"2016-07-27T00:09:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-6887"],"journal":"Journal of Aging & Health","last_mentioned_on":1469597737,"links":["http:\/\/jah.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/07\/22\/0898264316660414.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jah.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/07\/22\/0898264316660414.full.pdf","pmid":"27458254","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Carer Focused and Dyadic Multicomponent Interventions for Carers of People With Dementia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-metaanalysis-comparing-carer-focused-dyadic-multicomponent-interventions-carers-pe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137857,"mean":6.8794880300098,"rank":3370909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4723204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137857,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257611,"mean":11.921769853654,"rank":96622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":158769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257611,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":4.6053655172414,"rank":227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.5375,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
