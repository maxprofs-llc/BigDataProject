Where \u03b1T-cat is expressed in the brain, and how its loss could contribute to this disorder, are entirely unknown.\nWe used the \u03b1T-cat knockout mouse to examine the localization of \u03b1T-cat in the brain, and we used histology and immunofluorescence analysis to examine the neurobiological consequences of its loss.\nWe found that \u03b1T-cat comprises the ependymal cell junctions of the ventricles of the brain, and its loss led to compensatory upregulation of \u03b1E-cat expression. Notably, \u03b1T-cat was not detected within the choroid plexus, which relies on cell junction components common to typical epithelial cells. While \u03b1T-cat was not detected in neurons of the cerebral cortex, it was abundantly detected within neuronal structures of the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Although \u03b1T-cat loss led to no overt differences in cerebral or cerebellar structure, RNA-sequencing analysis from wild type versus knockout cerebella identified a number of disease-relevant signaling pathways associated with \u03b1T-cat loss, such as GABA-A receptor activation.\nThese findings raise the possibility that the genetic associations between \u03b1T-cat and autism may be due to ependymal and cerebellar defects, and highlight the potential importance of a seemingly redundant adherens junction component to a neurological disorder.","altmetric_jid":"508ef92b3cf0583634000000","authors":["Stephen Sai Folmsbee","Douglas R.
