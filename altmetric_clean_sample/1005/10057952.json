Clinical records for all patients were reviewed for surgical outcomes and clinical follow-up. Surgical findings of a femoral hernia sac or widened femoral canal requiring repair, with symptomatic relief after the procedure, were considered positive for a femoral hernia.\nAmong the 40 femoral hernias examined by sonography, 33 of 40 groins underwent surgical exploration, with 32 true-positive findings and 1 false-positive finding on sonography. The false-positive case was an inguinal hernia at surgery. The accuracy of sonography was 96.9% for those with surgical correlations. The remaining 7 patients did not undergo surgery but had clinical follow-up.\nThis study confirms high diagnostic accuracy of sonography for nonpalpable femoral hernias in symptomatic groins compared to surgical findings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f0e","authors":["Harun Gupta","Nawaraj Subedi","Philip Robinson"],"doi":"10.7863\/ultra.15.09045","endpage":"1679","first_seen_on":"2016-07-26T21:41:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-9613"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1479640536,"links":["http:\/\/www.jultrasoundmed.org\/content\/35\/8\/1675.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/www.jultrasoundmed.org\/content\/35\/8\/1675.full","http:\/\/www.jultrasoundmed.org\/content\/35\/8\/1675.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jultrasoundmed.org\/content\/35\/8\/1675.full.pdf","pmid":"27335438","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"1675","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Effectiveness of Sonography in Detecting Clinically Occult Femoral Hernias","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effectiveness-sonography-detecting-clinically-occult-femoral-hernias"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":3.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719347,"mean":6.622418915792,"rank":1672586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6032793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719347,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254590,"mean":11.802955516538,"rank":72547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":181277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254590,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1167,"mean":3.2532624356775,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1167,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.380701754386,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"NL":1},"mendeley":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Douglas_M_White\/statuses\/758054614537269248","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10057952],"posted_on":"2016-07-26T21:41:18+00:00","author":{"name":"Douglas M White","url":"http:\/\/www.msksonography.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1886907619\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Doctor of Physical Therapy * Gastro-tourist * Founding Past President Imaging Special Interest Group APTA * MSK Sonologist * Tweets are my own opinion","id_on_source":"Douglas_M_White","tweeter_id":"15873089","geo":{"lt":42.35843,"ln":-71.05977,"country":"US"},"followers":349},"tweet_id":"758054614537269248"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PTImgSIG\/statuses\/758095328277041152","license":"gnip","rt":["Douglas_M_White"],"citation_ids":[10057952],"posted_on":"2016-07-27T00:23:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Imaging Spec Int Grp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/724961965928550400\/JTTVjGRj_normal.jpg","description":"Imaging Special Interest Group of Orthopaedic Section of APTA","id_on_source":"PTImgSIG","tweeter_id":"724927059038994434","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":154},"tweet_id":"758095328277041152"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jultrasoundmed\/statuses\/765215959112097792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10057952],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T15:57:56+00:00","author":{"name":"jum","url":"http:\/\/www.jultrasoundmed.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/878250019295555584\/9oZ9OVYu_normal.jpg","description":"The multidisciplinary medical ultrasound journal","id_on_source":"jultrasoundmed","tweeter_id":"426229263","geo":{"lt":39.09928,"ln":-76.84831,"country":"US"},"followers":1486},"tweet_id":"765215959112097792"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EMDexUS\/statuses\/765264731649241088","license":"gnip","rt":["jultrasoundmed"],"citation_ids":[10057952],"posted_on":"2016-08-15T19:11:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Daniel Dexeus","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/898298360205127680\/Pk8rNw-r_normal.jpg","description":"Emergency -
