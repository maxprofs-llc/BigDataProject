However, its use on vegetable crops has been of concern due to the potential prevalence of microcontaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in the latter, which represents a possible health hazard to consumers. We investigated the uptake of three PPCPs (atenolol, diclofenac, and ofloxacin), at three different concentrations in irrigation water (0.5, 5, and 25\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L(-1)) in relation to three varying volumetric soil moisture depletion levels of 14\u00a0% (-4.26\u00a0kPa), 10\u00a0% (-8.66\u00a0kPa), and 7\u00a0% (-18.37\u00a0kPa) by various vegetable crop species. Experiments were conducted in a split-split block completely randomized design. PPCPs were extracted using a developed method of accelerated solvent extraction and solid phase extraction and analyzed via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). Results indicate that all treated crops were capable of PPCP uptake at nanogram per gram concentrations independent of the applied soil moisture depletion levels and PPCP concentrations. Ofloxacin was the chemical with the highest uptake amounts, followed by atenolol and then diclofenac. Although the results were not statistically significant, higher concentrations of PPCPs were detected in plants maintained under higher soil moisture levels of 14\u00a0% (-4.26\u00a0kPa).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Sergio Santiago","Deborah M.
