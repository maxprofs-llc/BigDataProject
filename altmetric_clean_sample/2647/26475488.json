Oxidation of the three-coordinate imido (ArL)Fe(NAd) (5) with chlorotriphenylmethane afforded (ArL)FeCl(\u2022NAd) (6) with concomitant expulsion of Ph3C(C6H5)CPh2. The respective alkyl\/aryl imido\/iminyl pairs (3, 2; 5, 6) have been characterized by EPR, zero-field 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer, magnetometry, single crystal X-ray diffraction, XAS, and EXAFS for 6. The high-spin (S = 5\/2) imidos exhibit characteristically short Fe\u00ac-N bonds (3: 1.708(4) \u00c5; 5: 1.674(11) \u00c5), whereas the corresponding iminyls exhibit elongated Fe\u00ac-N bonds (2: 1.768(2) \u00c5; 6: 1.761(6) \u00c5). Comparison of the pre-edge absorption feature (1s \u2192 3d) in the X-ray absorption spectra reveal that the four imido\/iminyl complexes share a common iron oxidation level consistent with a ferric formulation (3: 7111.5 eV, 2: 7111.5 eV; 5: 7112.2 eV, 6: 7112.4 eV) as compared with a ferrous amine adduct (ArL)FeCl(NH2Ad) (7: 7110.3 eV). N K-edge X-ray absorption spectra reveal a common low-energy absorption present only for the iminyl species 2 (394.5 eV) and 6 (394.8 eV) that was assigned as a N 1s promotion into a N-localized, singly occupied iminyl orbital. Kinetic analysis of the reaction between the respective iron imido and iminyl complexes with toluene yielded the following activation parameters: Ea (kcal\/mol) 3: 12.1, 2: 9.2; 5: 11.5, 6: 7.1. The attenuation of the Fe-N bond interaction on oxidation from an imido to an iminyl complex leads to a reduced enthalpic barrier [\u0394(\u0394H\u2021) ~5 kcal\/mol]; the alkyl iminyl 6 has a reduced enthalpic barrier (1.84 kcal\/mol) as compared with the aryl iminyl 2 (3.84 kcal\/mol), consistent with iminyl radical delocalization into the aryl substituent in 2 as compared with 6.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Wilding, Matthew J.T.","Iovan, Diana A.","Wrobel, Alexandra T","Lukens, James T.","MacMillan, Samantha N.","Lancaster, Kyle M.","Betley, Theodore A."],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b08714","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T11:17:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1506165423,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28937756?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28937756","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Direct comparison of C\u2013H bond amination efficacy through manipulation of nitrogen-valence centered redox: imido versus iminyl","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4517964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116538,"mean":11.751093369488,"rank":62788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":41530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116538,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19371,"mean":5.3235321631389,"rank":13194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":4008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19371,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":8.5998805970149,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpinStatePapers\/statuses\/911549971937107968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26475488],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T11:17:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Spin-state Papers","url":"http:\/\/www.marcelswart.eu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/552429679714390016\/zJTb3ZEr_normal.jpeg","description":"Here you will find an automated update of papers dealing with spin-states in transition-metal complexes, taken directly from PubMed","id_on_source":"SpinStatePapers","tweeter_id":"2963866557","geo":{"lt":41.98311,"ln":2.82493,"country":"ES"},"followers":57},"tweet_id":"911549971937107968"}]}}
