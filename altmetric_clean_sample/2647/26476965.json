TGF-\u03b21 and CCL3\/4 expression patterns in different degenerative human nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues were measured by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the effects of TGF-\u03b21 on CCL3\/4 expression were measured by qPCR, ELISA and immunofluorescence. The roles of NF-\u03baB and MAPK in TGF-\u03b21-mediated CCL3\/4 promoter activity were studied using siRNAs, western blotting and qPCR. After establishing an IVDD rat model in vivo, we administered intradiscal injections of TGF-\u03b21. The effects of TGF-\u03b21 on IVDD were determined by MRI and histological analyses, and the effects of TGF-\u03b21 on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) inflammation and pain development were determined by IHC staining and pain-behavior testing, respectively. TGF-\u03b21 and CCL3\/4 expression was elevated in degenerative NP tissue. CCL4 expression was significantly inhibited by TGF-\u03b21 treatment. Pharmacological inhibition or siRNA knockdown of the ERK1\/2 signaling attenuated TGF-\u03b21-mediated suppression of CCL4 expression. In vivo, TGF-\u03b21 injection inhibited the development of degenerative features in the IVDD model. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 prevented the inflammatory response and pain development. The results of this study show that TGF-\u03b21 downregulates CCL4 expression through ERK1\/2 signaling activation in NP cells. Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 can prevent degenerative processes, inhibit inflammatory responses in the DRG and prevent pain development in the IVDD rat model. The results of this study indicate that TGF-\u03b21 may represent a therapeutic target for the control of inflammation-related pain associated with IVDD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b5","authors":["Zhang, Jian","Li, Zemin","Chen, Fan","Liu, Hui","Wang, Hua","Li, Xiang","Liu, Xianguo","Wang, Jianru","Zheng, Zhaomin"],"doi":"10.1038\/emm.2017.136","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T12:17:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2092-6413"],"issue":"9","journal":"Experimental and Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506169053,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28935976?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28935976","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Extracellular signalling molecules","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"TGF-\u03b21 suppresses CCL3\/4 expression through the ERK signaling pathway and inhibits intervertebral disc degeneration and inflammation-related pain in a rat model.","type":"article","volume":"49"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":7304702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116538,"mean":11.751134558123,"rank":95087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116538,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":362,"mean":3.0062326869806,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":362,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.67,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/qPCR_DigitalPCR\/statuses\/911565196958638086","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26476965],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T12:17:33+00:00","author":{"name":"qPCR\/dPCR","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/783296557353472000\/UC7eNMYm_normal.jpg","description":"Promoting developments in qPCR and Digital PCR around the world","id_on_source":"qPCR_DigitalPCR","tweeter_id":"783271584622604288","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":47},"tweet_id":"911565196958638086"}]}}
