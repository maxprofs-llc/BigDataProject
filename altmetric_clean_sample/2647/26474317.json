Its clinical use is often limited due to its potentially fatal cardiotoxic side effect. Increasing evidence indicates that tumour protein p53 (p53), adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nucleoporin p62 (p62), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are critical mediators of Dox-induced apoptosis, and subsequent dysregulation of autophagy. Aspalathin, a polyphenolic dihydrochalcone C-glucoside has been shown to activate AMPK while decreasing the expression of p53. However, the role that aspalathin could play in the inhibition of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity through increased autophagy flux remained unexplored. H9c2 cardiomyocytes and Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium and treated with or without Dox for five days. Thereafter, cells exposed to 0.2 \u00b5M Dox were co-treated with either 20 \u00b5M Dexrazozane (Dexra) or 0.2 \u00b5M aspalathin (ASP) daily for 5 days. Results obtained showed that ASP mediates its cytoprotective effect in a p53-dependent manner, by increasing the Bcl-2\/Bax ratio and decreasing apoptosis. The latter effect was diminished through ASP-induced activation of autophagy-related genes (Atgs) with an associated decrease in p62 through induction of AMPK and Fox01. Furthermore, we showed that ASP was able to potentiate this effect without decreasing the anti-cancer efficacy of Dox, as could be observed in Caov-3 ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, the data presented in this study provides a credible mechanism by which ASP co-treatment could protect the myocardium from Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Johnson, Rabia","Shabalala, Samukelisiwe","Louw, Johan","Kappo, Abidemi","Muller, Christo"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules22101589","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T10:37:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"10","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1506166563,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28937626?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28937626","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI AG","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Aspalathin Reverts Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity through Increased Autophagy and Decreased Expression of p53\/mTOR\/p62 Signaling","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aspalathin-reverts-doxorubicininduced-cardiotoxicity-through-increased-autophagy-decreased-expressio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4270388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3965195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116538,"mean":11.751100663309,"rank":56392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":54684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116538,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4008,"mean":2.1436126778138,"rank":1056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4008,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":0.9440625,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
