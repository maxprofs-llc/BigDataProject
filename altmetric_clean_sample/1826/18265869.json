The emergence of dopamine supersensitivity might be related to upregulation of dopamine D2 receptor, which engenders tolerance to antipsychotics, rebound psychosis, and tardive dyskinesia (TD). A 24-year-old man with a history of treatment-resistant schizophrenia was hospitalized for treatment of bone fracture sustained during a suicide attempt. After the operation, his clinical symptoms implied malignant catatonia. The patient discontinued antipsychotics without rebound psychosis under clonazepam treatment. His psychotic symptoms were controlled further with 24 mg\/day aripiprazole without relapse or worsening. Clonazepam might be an effective option for the management of dopamine supersensitivity psychosis (DSP).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b57","authors":["Mina Fukai","Tetsu Hirosawa","Tetsuya Takahashi","Reizo Kaneda","Mitsuru Kikuchi","Yoshio Minabe"],"doi":"10.1177\/2045125316681750","first_seen_on":"2017-03-30T11:18:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-1253","2045-1261"],"issue":"3","journal":"Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1490871127,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28348731?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5354128","pmid":"28348731","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Clonazepam improves dopamine supersensitivity in a schizophrenia patient: a case report","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/2045125316681750","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clonazepam-improves-dopamine-supersensitivity-schizophrenia-patient-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249269,"mean":13.229635845756,"rank":206258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249269,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":7.1805773195876,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":24.5115,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lp_mypapers\/statuses\/847401043197517830","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18265869],"posted_on":"2017-03-30T10:52:07+00:00","author":{"name":"mypapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/511323067478736896\/WT-bQ6xQ_normal.jpeg","description":"papers about isomirs, squizo","id_on_source":"lp_mypapers","tweeter_id":"2810354166","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":52},"tweet_id":"847401043197517830"}]}}
