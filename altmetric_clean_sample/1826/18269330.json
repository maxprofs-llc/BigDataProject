Structures of the compounds were determined on the basis of extensive use of 1-D and 2-D NMR experiments, together with HR-ESI-MS and IR measurements, as well as the results of acid hydrolysis. Compounds 1-2 represented steroidal saponins with an unusual substitution pattern, which possessed a double bond at C-25 and were glycosylated at 1-OH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010b5","authors":["Hui Zhang","Yan-Fang Su","Feng-Ying Yang"],"doi":"10.1080\/14786419.2015.1137569","first_seen_on":"2017-03-30T11:25:20+00:00","issns":["1478-6419","1478-6427"],"journal":"Natural Product Research","last_mentioned_on":1490872865,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26821553?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26821553","pubdate":"2016-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Three new steroidal saponins fromHelleborus thibetanus","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14786419.2015.1137569","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/three-new-steroidal-saponins-ihelleborus-thibetanusi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":7289361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249270,"mean":13.229568730969,"rank":206257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249270,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":743,"mean":1.3444501347709,"rank":427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":743,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.78529411764706,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RootPapers\/statuses\/847408332537184257","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18269330],"posted_on":"2017-03-30T11:21:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Root Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/447736797422813184\/Q7OqMgVA_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Plant Root papers in #PubMed, #arXiv, #Bioarxiv and #PeerJ Preprints.
