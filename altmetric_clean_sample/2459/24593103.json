In previous studies, greater attention was paid to impairments in motor disturbances in contrast to impairments of cognitive function in PD that was often ignored. In present study, a duration discrimination paradigm was used to assess global and local biological motion (BM) perception in healthy controls(HCs) and PD patients with and without dopamine substitution treatment (DST). Biological motion sequences and inanimate motion sequences (inverted BM sequences) were sequentially presented on a screen. Observers were required to verbally make a 2-alternative forced-choice to indicate whether the first or second interval appeared longer. The stimuli involved global and local BM sequences. Statistical analyses were conducted on points of subjective equality (PSE). We found significant differences between untreated PD patients and HCs as well as differences between global and local BM conditions. PD patients have a deficit in both global and local BM perception. Nevertheless, these two BM conditions can be improved under DST. Our data indicates that BM perception may be damaged in PD patients and dopaminergic medication is conducive to maintain the BM perception in PD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Tingting Liu","Panpan Hu","Ruihua Cao","Xing Ye","Yanghua Tian","Xianwen Chen","Kai Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-10463-2","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T03:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504345289,"links":["https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-10463-2"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-10463-2.pdf","pmid":"28860519","pubdate":"2017-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"10159","subjects":["science"],"title":"Dopaminergic Modulation of Biological Motion Perception in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dopaminergic-modulation-biological-motion-perception-patients-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6420474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176332,"mean":12.391784019826,"rank":124800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176332,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37889,"mean":14.76877734375,"rank":27245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37889,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3511,"mean":13.343384615385,"rank":2445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3511,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/903452486182158338","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24593103],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T03:00:32+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3455},"tweet_id":"903452486182158338"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ScienceofPD\/statuses\/903915775521677312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24593103],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T09:41:29+00:00","author":{"name":"ScienceofParkinsons","url":"http:\/\/www.scienceofparkinsons.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/689546763347320832\/9IQwrd4Z_normal.jpg","description":"Latest research updates for Parkinson's disease.","id_on_source":"ScienceofPD","tweeter_id":"4827494117","geo":{"lt":52.2,"ln":0.11667,"country":"GB"},"followers":286},"tweet_id":"903915775521677312"}]}}
