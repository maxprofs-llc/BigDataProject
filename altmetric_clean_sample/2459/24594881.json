To our knowledge, intrastromal ring segment penetration has only been shown to occur in the intraoperative or immediate postoperative period. We postulate that the perforation in this case is due to progressive thinning of the cornea, possibly in combination with habitual eye rubbing.\nA 44-year-old man presented with acute corneal hydrops related to penetration of Descemet's membrane and endothelium by an intrastromal ring segment implanted 7\u00a0years prior. Removal of the ring segment resulted in an anterior chamber fistula that directed fluid through the ring segment tunnel to the ocular surface. Leakage of aqueous humor was successfully controlled, and corneal edema gradually resolved.\nThis case indicates the need for long term monitoring of ring segment proximity to the posterior corneal surface, especially in patients with ectatic ocular conditions and\/or habitual eye rubbing behavior.","altmetric_jid":"52d3d74b86a348c7778b4c58","authors":["Majid Moshirfar","Andrew E.
