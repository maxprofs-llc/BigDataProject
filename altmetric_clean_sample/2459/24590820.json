Data extracted included initial and final visual acuities, age, gender, ethnicity, complications, treatment, duration of disease, and number of recurrences.\nOne hundred one patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease were identified, 68 (67%) of which were female. Mean age was 34 +\/- 14 years (range, 8 to 75 years). Asians presented at a significantly older age than all other groups. One hundred three eyes (51%) developed at least one complication, including cataract in 84 eyes (42%), glaucoma in 54 eyes (27%), choroidal neovascular membranes in 22 eyes (11%), and subretinal fibrosis in 13 eyes (6%). Patients who developed at least one complication had a significantly longer median duration of disease and number of recurrent episodes of inflammation (P =.0001 for each) than did those patients who developed no complications. Statistically significant associations existed between poor final visual acuity and greater numbers of complications (P =.001), greater age at onset (P =.03), a longer median duration of disease (P =.03), and greater number of recurrent episodes of inflammation (P =.0004). Eyes possessing a better visual acuity at presentation were more likely to have a better visual acuity at final follow-up (P =.001).\nFactors associated with a worse final acuity included increasing numbers of complications, greater age at onset, and worse acuity at presentation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Russell W Read","Aida Rechodouni","Neil Butani","Richard Johnston","Laurie D LaBree","Ronald E Smith","Narsing A Rao"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0002-9394(01)00937-0","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T01:25:34+00:00","issns":["00029394"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1504116280,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0002-9394(01)00937-0"],"pmid":"11336934","pubdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Complications and prognostic factors in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complications-prognostic-factors-vogtkoyanagiharada-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":7,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":1241984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7132888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171112,"mean":12.407650858215,"rank":33823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":136264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171112,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2452,"mean":2.8140995512036,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2452,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":2.0073770491803,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
