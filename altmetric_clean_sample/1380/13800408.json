However, the real-life impact of DASH on reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk in routine clinical setting has not been studied.\nA parallel-group, open-labelled, physician-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted in January-June 2013 and followed up for 6- and 12-months in primary care settings in Hong Kong. Patients newly diagnosed with grade 1 hypertension (aged 40-70years) who had no concomitant medical conditions requiring dietary modifications were consecutively recruited. Subjects were randomised to standard education (usual care) (n=275), or usual care plus dietitian-delivered DASH-based dietary counselling in a single one-to-one session (intervention) (n=281). Primary outcomes were the changes in estimated 10-year CV risk.\nOutcome data were available for 504 (90.6%) and 485 (87.2%) patients at 6 and 12months, respectively. There was no difference in the reduction of 10-year CV risk between the two groups at 6months (-0.13%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.50% to 0.23%, p=0.477) and 12months (-0.08%, 95% CI -0.33% to 0.18%, p=0.568). Multivariate regression analyses showed that male subjects, younger patients, current smokers, subjects with lower educational level, and those who dined out for main meals for \u22654 times in a typical week were significantly associated with no improvements in CV risk.\nThe findings may not support automatic referral of newly diagnosed grade 1 hypertensive patients for further one-to-one dietitian counselling on top of primary care physician's usual care. Patients with those risk factors identified should receive more clinical attention to reduce their CV risk.\nChiCTR-TRC-13003014 (http:\/\/www.chictr.org.cn\/enindex.aspx).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Wong, Martin C S","Wang, Harry H X","Kwan, Mandy W M","Li, Shannon T S","Liang, Miaoyin","Fung, Franklin D H","Yeung, Ming Sze","Fong, Brian C Y","Zhang, De Xing","Chan, David K L","Yan, Bryan P","Coats, Andrew J S","Griffiths, Sian M","Martin C.S.
