PIN1 exerts its action by inducing conformational and functional changes on key cellular proteins, following proline-directed phosphorylation. Through this post-phosphorylation signal transduction mechanism, PIN1 controls the extent and direction of the cellular response to a variety of inputs, in physiology and disease. This review discusses PIN1's roles in normal mammary development and cancerous progression, as well as the clinical impact of targeting this enzyme in breast cancer patients.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2016.122.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["Alessandra Rustighi","Alessandro Zannini","Elena Campaner","Yari Ciani","Silvano Piazza","Giannino Del Sal"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2016.122","first_seen_on":"2016-11-19T04:15:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5403","1350-9047"," 1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1483113706,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cdd2016122a.html"],"pmid":"27834957","pubdate":"2016-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chaperones","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer stem cells","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"PIN1 in breast development and cancer: a clinical perspective","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pin1-breast-development-cancer-clinical-perspective"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7958342,"mean":6.7226589717569,"rank":4148829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3782027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7958342,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258530,"mean":12.043276986334,"rank":139914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117030,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258530,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1097,"mean":5.3111240875912,"rank":712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1097,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.2822580645161,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
