RBTN1 and RBTN2 encode highly related proteins that possess cysteine-rich LIM motifs. TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1 encode a unique subgroup of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that share exceptional homology in their bHLH sequences. We have found that RBTN1 and RBTN2 have the ability to interact with each of the leukemogenic bHLH proteins (TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1). These interactions occur in vivo and appear to be mediated by sequences within the LIM and bHLH domains. The LIM-bHLH interactions are highly specific in that RBTN1 and RBTN2 will associate with TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1, but not with other bHLH proteins, including E12, E47, Id1, NHLH1, AP4, MAX, MYC and MyoD1. Moreover, RBTN1 and RBTN2 can interact with TAL1 polypeptides that exist in assembled bHLH heterodimers (e.g. TAL1-E47), suggesting that the RBTN proteins can influence the functional properties of TAL1. Finally, we have identified a subset of leukemia patients that harbor tumor-specific rearrangements of both their RBTN2 and TAL1 genes. Thus, the activated alleles of these genes may promote leukemia cooperatively, perhaps as a result of bHLH-LIM interactions between their protein products.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["I Wadman","J Li","R O Bash","A Forster","H Osada","T H Rabbitts","R Baer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T11:10:13+00:00","issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"20","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1207791164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7957052","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC395422"],"pmcid":"PMC395422","pmid":"7957052","pubdate":"1994-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Specific in vivo association between the bHLH and LIM proteins implicated in human T cell leukemia.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specific-vivo-association-between-bhlh-lim-proteins-implicated-human-t-cell-leukemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4586246,"mean":5.382841503168,"rank":1062709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2953438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4586246,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155780,"mean":8.9782733744601,"rank":45790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":108019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155780,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4305,"mean":3.5623698884758,"rank":758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4305,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":16.667391304348,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
