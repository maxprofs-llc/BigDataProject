The purified complex contained the PscA, PscC, PscB, PscD subunits and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein. Its mass was found to be 454 kDa by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), indicating the presence of two copies of the PscA subunit, one copy of the PscB and PscD subunits, three FMO proteins and at least one copy of the PscC subunit. An additional mass peak at 183 kDa suggested that FMO trimers copurify with the RC complexes. Images of negatively stained RC complexes were recorded by STEM and aligned and classified by multivariate statistical analysis. Averages of the major classes indicated that different morphologies of the elongated particles (length=19 nm, width=8 nm) resulted from a rotation around the long axis. The 3D map reconstructed from these projections allowed visualization of the RC complex associated with one FMO trimer. A second FMO trimer could be correspondingly accommodated to yield a symmetric complex, a structure observed in a small number of side views and proposed to be the intact form of the RC complex.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Herv\u00e9-W R\u00e9migy","Henning Stahlberg","Dimitrios Fotiadis","Shirley A M\u00fcller","Bettina Wolpensinger","Andreas Engel","G\u00fcnter Hauska","Georgios Tsiotis"],"doi":"10.1006\/jmbi.1999.2925","endpage":"858","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T23:59:23+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00222836","0022-2836"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1300105599,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/jmbi.1999.2925","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10398586"],"pmid":"10398586","pubdate":"1999-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"851","title":"The reaction center complex from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum: a structural analysis by scanning transmission electron microscopy.","type":"article","volume":"290","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reaction-center-complex-green-sulfur-bacterium-chlorobium-tepidum-structural-analysis-scanning-trans-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94750,"mean":8.1601352837499,"rank":24593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94750,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3301,"mean":2.5283751515152,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3301,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.4269230769231,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
