In this study, we used a genome-wide haplotype association mapping (HAM) approach to identify a haplotype block within Cer1 that partitions inbred mice strains into high and low BMD groups. A cohort of 1083 high and low BMD human subjects were studied, and a nonsynonymous SNP (rs3747532) in human CER1 was identified to be associated with increased risk of both low BMD in premenopausal women (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.0-4.6; p < 0.05) and increased risk of vertebral fractures (OR: 1.82, p = 0.025) in the postmenopausal cohort. We also showed that Cer1 is expressed in mouse bone and growth plate by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, consistent with polymorphisms potentially influencing BMD. Our successful identification of an association with CER1 in humans together with our mouse study suggests that CER1 may play a role in the development of bone or its metabolism. Our study highlights the use of publicly available databases for rapidly surveying the genome for quantitative trait loci.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007ba6","authors":["Tang, Paul LF","Cheung, Ching\u2010Lung","Sham, Pak C","McClurg, Philip","Lee, Bob","Chan, Shut\u2010Yan","Smith, David K","Tanner, Julian A","Su, Andrew I","Cheah, Kathryn SE","Kung, Annie WC","Song, You\u2010Qiang"],"doi":"10.1359\/jbmr.081258","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T12:49:22+00:00","issns":["1523-4681"],"journal":"Journal of Bone & Mineral Research","last_mentioned_on":1268278653,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1359\/jbmr.081258","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19113921"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1359\/jbmr.081258\/pdf","pmid":"19113921","pubdate":"2008-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons and The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","orthopedics"],"title":"Genome-wide haplotype association mapping in mice identifies a genetic variant in CER1 associated with BMD and fracture in southern Chinese women.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-haplotype-association-mapping-mice-identifies-genetic-variant-icer1i-associated-bmd-fract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4010805,"mean":5.0317842083916,"rank":920017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2534040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4010805,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126712,"mean":9.099723571333,"rank":38445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126712,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1228,"mean":3.3843977180114,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1228,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":19.370689655172,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
