The traditional centralized model for diagnosing rubella is cost-prohibitive in resource-limited settings, representing a major obstacle to the prevention of CRS. As a step toward decentralized diagnostic systems, we developed a proof-of-concept digital microfluidic (DMF) diagnostic platform that possesses the flexibility and performance of automated immunoassay platforms used in central facilities, but with a form factor the size of a shoebox.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efc","authors":["Alphonsus H.C.
