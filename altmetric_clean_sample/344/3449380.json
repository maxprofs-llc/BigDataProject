We have determined the structure of bacterially expressed rat NTF2 at 1.6 angstroms resolution using X-ray crystallography. The NTF2 polypeptide chain forms an alpha + beta barrel that opens at one end to form a distinctive hydrophobic cavity and its fold is homologous to that of scytalone dehydratase. The NTF2 hydrophobic cavity is a candidate for a potential binding site for other proteins involved in nuclear import such as Ran and nucleoporin p62. In addition, the hydrophobic cavity contains a putative catalytic Asp-His pair, which raises the possibility of an unanticipated enzymatic activity of the molecule that may have implications for the molecular mechanism of nuclear protein import.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["T L Bullock","W D Clarkson","H M Kent","M Stewart"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T12:13:47+00:00","issns":["0022-2836"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1186408884,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8757804"],"pmid":"8757804","pubdate":"1996-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The 1.6 angstroms resolution crystal structure of nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2).","type":"article","volume":"260","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/16-angstroms-resolution-crystal-structure-nuclear-transport-factor-2-ntf2-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990102,"mean":5.0362064143623,"rank":917503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990102,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126931,"mean":9.1319526026774,"rank":38550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126931,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3479,"mean":2.4398710791367,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3479,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":1.5198709677419,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
