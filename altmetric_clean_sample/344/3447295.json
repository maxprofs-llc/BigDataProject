It is caused by a microangiopathy affecting the arterioles of the brain, retina, and cochlea, giving the classic clinical triad of subacute encephalopathy, visual loss secondary to retinal branch occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. The features of four cases of this syndrome are presented. MR imaging, retinal fluorescein angiography, and audiography findings enable diagnosis. Early therapy may reduce sequelae and improve recovery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006984","authors":["Tai Hung Do","Christiane Fisch","Fran\u00e7ois Evoy"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T09:15:45+00:00","issns":["1936-959X"],"journal":"American Journal of Neuroradiology","last_mentioned_on":1423559710,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajnr.org\/content\/25\/3\/382.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajnr.org\/content\/25\/3\/382.full.pdf","pmid":"15037459","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","neurology"],"title":"Susac Syndrome: Report of Four Cases and Review of the Literature","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/susac-syndrome-report-four-cases-review-literature-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4741736,"mean":5.6933955136704,"rank":3361502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":771532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4741736,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169307,"mean":8.836373796558,"rank":118497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169307,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1822,"mean":3.0581669412411,"rank":1238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1822,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":5.716972972973,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":19,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":2,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/midlandsneuro\/status\/565076496839360513","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3447295],"posted_on":"2015-02-10T09:15:10+00:00","author":{"name":"midlandsneurology","url":"http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/midlandsneurology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2301755049\/y7uhst7clhhidak188be_normal.jpeg","description":"An update on neurology training resources in the West Midlands or online.","id_on_source":"midlandsneuro","tweeter_id":"606282348","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":743},"tweet_id":"565076496839360513"}]}}
