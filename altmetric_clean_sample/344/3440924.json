To investigate whether any interactions exist between CENP-B and the other centromere proteins, we screened a cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid analysis. An interaction between CENP-B and CENP-C was detected, and the CENP-C domains required were determined to overlap with three Mif2 homologous regions, which were also revealed to be involved in the CENP-C assembly of centromeres by expression of truncated polypeptides in cultured cells. Overproduction of truncated CENP-B containing no CENP-C interaction domains caused abnormal duplication of CENP-C domains at G2 and cell cycle delay at metaphase. These results suggest that the interaction between CENP-B and CENP-C may be involved in the correct assembly of CENP-C on alphoid DNA. In other words, a possible molecular linkage may exist between one of the kinetochore components and human centromere DNA through CENP-B\/CENP-B box interaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Nobutaka Suzuki","Megumi Nakano","Naohito Nozaki","Shin-ichiro Egashira","Tuneko Okazaki","Hiroshi Masumoto"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m306477200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T12:55:35+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1270530394,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M306477200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14612452"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/279\/7\/5934.full.pdf","pmid":"14612452","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"CENP-B interacts with CENP-C domains containing Mif2 regions responsible for centromere localization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cenpb-interacts-cenpc-domains-containing-mif2-regions-responsible-centromere-localization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":816209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94996,"mean":8.184301110585,"rank":24705,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94996,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6400806647172,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":10003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
