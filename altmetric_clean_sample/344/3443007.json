Among the congenital sideroblastic anemias (CSAs), the most common form is X-linked sideroblastic anemia, due to mutations in 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2). A novel autosomal recessive CSA, caused by mutations in the erythroid specific mitochondrial transporter SLC25A38, was recently defined. Other known etiologies include mutations in genes encoding the thiamine transporter SLC19A2, the RNA-modifying enzyme pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1), a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCB7), glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5), as well as mitochondrial DNA deletions. Despite these known diverse causes, in a substantial portion of CSA cases a presumed genetic defect remains unknown.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Bergmann, Anke K.","Campagna, Dean R.","McLoughlin, Erin M.","Agarwal, Suneet","Fleming, Mark D.","Bottomley, Sylvia S.","Neufeld, Ellis J."],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.22244","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T17:54:19+00:00","issns":["1545-5017"],"journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1287214159,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/pbc.22244","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19731322","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2843911"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.22244\/pdf","pmid":"19731322","pubdate":"2009-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Systematic Molecular Genetic Analysis of Congenital Sideroblastic Anemia: Evidence for Genetic Heterogeneity and Identification of Novel Mutations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-molecular-genetic-analysis-congenital-sideroblastic-anemia-evidence-genetic-heterogeneity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3990102,"mean":5.0362064143623,"rank":917524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3990102,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125943,"mean":9.1193924090839,"rank":38274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125943,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1164,"mean":2.0275986218777,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1164,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":3.7512692307692,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
