We analyzed a set of linked STR and SNP loci from the paternally inherited Y chromosome to infer the past demography of 55 African and Eurasian populations, using both the parametric and nonparametric coalescent-based methods implemented in the BEAST application. We inferred expansion events in most sedentary farmer populations, while we found constant effective population sizes for both nomadic hunter-gatherers and seminomadic herders. Our results differed, on several aspects, from previous results on mtDNA and autosomal markers. First, we found more recent expansion patterns in Eurasia than in Africa. This discrepancy, substantially stronger than the ones found with the other kind of markers, may result from a lower effective population size for men, which might have made male-transmitted markers more sensitive to the out-of-Africa bottleneck. Second, we found expansion signals only for sedentary farmers but not for nomadic herders in Central Asia, while these signals were found for both kind of populations in this area when using mtDNA or autosomal markers. Expansion signals in this area may result from spatial expansion processes and may have been erased for the Y chromosome among the herders because of restricted male gene flow.
