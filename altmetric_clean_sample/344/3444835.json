We measured substrate oxidation and energy metabolism in 10 nonobese untreated NIDDM patients with fasting glucose levels of 7-8 mM with indirect calorimetry in the basal state and during an isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (approximately 100 mU\/L) clamp without (control) and with a concomitant infusion (approximately 0.35 mmol\/min) of Intralipid, a triglyceride emulsion. In the control study, fasting rates of total glucose turnover [( 3-3H]glucose) and glucose and lipid oxidation (9.4 +\/- 1.4, 7.3 +\/- 1.3, and 3.0 +\/- 0.4 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively) were comparable with those of nondiabetic individuals. After insulin administration, lipid oxidation was normally suppressed (to 1.3 +\/- 0.3 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01), as were the circulating levels of FFA, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate, whereas glucose oxidation doubled (14.1 +\/- 1.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01). Because glycemia was clamped at 7.5 mM, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was completely suppressed, and total glucose disposal was stimulated (to 25.7 +\/- 5.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01 vs. baseline), but glucose clearance (3.6 +\/- 0.8 ml.kg-1.min-1) was 30% reduced compared with normal. With concomitant lipid infusion, FFA, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate all rose during the clamp; correspondingly, lipid oxidation was maintained at fasting rates (3.6 +\/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.01 vs. control).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["S Bevilacqua","G Buzzigoli","R Bonadonna","L S Brandi","M Oleggini","C Boni","M Geloni","E Ferrannini"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T01:03:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0012-1797"],"issue":"3","journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1181693688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2307295"],"pmid":"2307295","pubdate":"1990-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Operation of Randle's cycle in patients with NIDDM.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/operation-randles-cycle-patients-niddm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636227,"mean":4.9205935445202,"rank":816752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636227,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96451,"mean":8.2632273094869,"rank":25257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96451,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2759,"mean":4.3640580130529,"rank":633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":1760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2759,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":11.727818181818,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
