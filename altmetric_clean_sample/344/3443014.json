This study examined the effects of 3 flavonoid-enriched fractions (a crude fraction, an anthocyanin-enriched fraction, and a proanthocyanidin-enriched fraction), which were prepared from lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium), on MMP activity in DU145 human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Using gelatin gel electrophoresis, MMP activity was evaluated from cells after 24-hr exposure to blueberry fractions. All fractions elicited an ability to decrease the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Of the fractions tested, the proanthocyanidin-enriched fraction was found to be the most effective at inhibiting MMP activity in these cells. No induction of either necrotic or apoptotic cell death was noted in these cells in response to treatment with the blueberry fractions. These findings indicate that flavonoids from blueberry possess the ability to effectively decrease MMP activity, which may decrease overall ECM degradation. This ability may be important in controlling tumor metastasis formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000d18","authors":["Matchett MD","MacKinnon SL","Sweeney MI","Gottschall-Pass KT","Hurta RA"],"doi":"10.1139\/o05-063","first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T17:55:01+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Biochemistry and Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1422461207,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16234852","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1139\/o05-063"],"pmid":"16234852","pubdate":"2005-10-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Blueberry flavonoids inhibit matrix metalloproteinase activity in DU145 human prostate cancer cells","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blueberry-flavonoids-inhibit-matrix-metalloproteinase-activity-du145-human-prostate-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4683775,"mean":5.7027612822493,"rank":432521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4233530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4683775,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164071,"mean":9.0082489912844,"rank":22341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":141199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164071,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":2.0900466666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.40625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
