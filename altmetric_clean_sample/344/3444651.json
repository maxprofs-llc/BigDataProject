Interestingly, N-methylnicotinamide, one of the metabolites of nicotinamide - could be more potent than its parent compound. In the present study we have investigated the influence of N-methylnicotinamide on arterial thrombosis in normotensive and renovascular hypertensive rats. The contribution of platelets, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in the mode of N-methylnicotinamide action was also determined. Furthermore, we examined the role of nitric oxide\/prostacyclin in the mechanisms of N-methylnicotinamide action. N-methylnicotinamide, but not nicotinamide, administered intravenously into renovascular hypertensive rats developing electrically induced arterial thrombosis caused dose-dependent decrease of thrombus weight, collagen-induced platelet aggregation and plasma antigen\/activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1, without changing of occlusion time, routine coagulation parameters and plasma activity of tissue plasminogen activator. Indomethacin - an inhibitor of prostacyclin synthesis, completely abolished the antithrombotic and antiplatelet effect of N-methylnicotinamide, and the plasma level of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) , prostacyclin metabolite, increased simultaneously with the inhibition of thrombus formation. Our study shows that N-methylnicotinamide via production\/release of prostacyclin inhibits arterial thrombosis development. The antithrombotic effect of N-methylnicotinamide is accompanied by platelet inhibition and enhanced fibrinolysis, due to the decrease production of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df4","authors":["A Mogielnicki","K Kramkowski","L Pietrzak","W Buczko"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-10T00:32:00+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0867-5910"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1423528200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17928647"],"pmid":"17928647","pubdate":"2007-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","pharmacology"],"title":"N-methylnicotinamide inhibits arterial thrombosis in hypertensive rats.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nmethylnicotinamide-inhibits-arterial-thrombosis-hypertensive-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4741736,"mean":5.6933955136704,"rank":3970440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4741736,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169308,"mean":8.8362932542662,"rank":136544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169308,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":2.039443902439,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.91818181818182,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
