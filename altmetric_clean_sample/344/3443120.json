Three positive clones were isolated with inserts of approximately 0.3 Kb (S1.1), 2 Kb (S1.2) and 2.2 Kb (S-1.3). The latter 2 contained an internal EcoRI site. All three clones cross-hybridized with one another, indicating sequence homology. The nucleotide sequence of S-1.1 was determined. Colinearity was established between 19 amino acids obtained by sequencing the amino terminus of pure SAP-1 and 57 bp from the 5' end of S-1.1. The open reading frame of S-1.1 coded for 67 amino acids. One glycosylation site was found 21 residues from the amino terminus, and no stop codons were found. S-1.1 codes for a mature polypeptide chain with a calculated molecular weight of 8955 daltons, corresponding to approximately 99% of mature SAP-1.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["N Dewji","D Wenger","S Fujibayashi","M Donoviel","F Esch","F Hill","J S O'Brien"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-09T18:09:54+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1197228636,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2868718"],"pmid":"2868718","pubdate":"1986-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular cloning of the sphingolipid activator protein-1 (SAP-1), the sulfatide sulfatase activator.","type":"article","volume":"134","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-cloning-sphingolipid-activator-protein1-sap1-sulfatide-sulfatase-activator"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":817149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94619,"mean":8.1537988754784,"rank":24550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94619,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6517,"mean":2.5134981583794,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1948,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6517,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.1375251798561,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Prosaposin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=176830218#altmetric_citation_20","license":"public","citation_ids":[3443119,3443120],"posted_on":"2007-12-09T19:30:36+00:00","summary":"Prosaposin also known as PSAP is a protein which in humans is encoded by the PSAP gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=11459847","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Andrew Su","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Andrew Su"}}]}}
