This paper uses time-series cross-sectional methods on California hospital discharge data from 1986-1994 to show the association of hospital prices with measures of market concentration changed steadily over this period, with prices now higher in less competitive areas, even for non-profit hospitals. Regression results are used to simulate the price impact of hypothetical hospital mergers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd1","authors":["Keeler, E B","Melnick, G","Zwanziger, J","Emmett B.
