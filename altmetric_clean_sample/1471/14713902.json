We compared group-specific response rates and willingness to be contacted about future study activities, as well as costs.\nIncentives increased survey response rates (55% response without incentive vs. a 69% response with incentive), with response of 74% in the $15 cash group, 69% in the token group, and 63% with a prize incentive. Incentives did not adversely affect willingness of adolescents to be contacted about a smoking intervention, (65% willing with incentives vs. 60% without, P = 0.03). In terms of cost per additional survey completed, token and prize groups were marginally more expensive than the no-incentive group ($0.40 and $1.42, respectively) while the large cash incentive was substantially more costly ($11.37).\nMonetary incentives improve response rates to a mailed survey, without adverse impact on willingness to further participate in intervention activities. However, a variety of issues must be considered when using incentives for recruitment to intervention studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003383","authors":["Brian C.
