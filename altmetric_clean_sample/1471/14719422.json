Cows fed rations 3 and 4 were offered 13.5 g\/d of duodenally available Lys and 4 g\/d of duodenally available Met for 3 wk prepartum. The total length of the study was 43 wk. Cows fed ration 4 consumed 3 to 4 kg more dry matter than did cows fed the other three rations, and milk yield and the percentage of milk protein and fat were significantly increased during the first 8 wk of lactation. In early lactation, cows fed ration 3 had a greater milk fat percentage but similar dry matter intake, protein percentage, and yield of 4% fat-corrected milk compared with cows fed ration 2. The concentrations of blood serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, triglyceride, and nonesterified fatty acids were lower for cows fed ration 4 during the first 8 wk of lactation than they were for cows fed the other three rations. The mammary arteriovenous difference of whole blood AA indicated that Met along with His and Arg may be the most limiting AA for milk yield.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["S.
