It would be ideal to be able to detect and treat preinvasive bronchial lesions, defined as dysplasia and carcinoma in situ before progressing to invasive cancer. Advanced airway-assessment techniques have opened an avenue for early detection and surveillance of endobronchial malignancy. This article reviews currently available advanced imaging techniques for early detection of lung cancer, including autofluorescence bronchoscopy, narrow-band imaging, high-magnification bronchovideoscopy, endobronchial ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography. Also discussed are the more recently developed endocytoscopy system and confocal fluorescence microendoscopy, currently used only for research purposes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005814","doi":"10.1016\/j.ccm.2013.04.005","first_seen_on":"2014-03-18T03:27:51+00:00","issns":["02725231"],"journal":"Clinics in chest medicine","last_mentioned_on":1395113223,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0272523113000543"],"pmid":"23993810","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Early Lung Cancer Methods for Detection","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-lung-cancer-methods-detection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2898221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97692,"mean":7.0624232529099,"rank":77372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97692,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":1.8776774193548,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
