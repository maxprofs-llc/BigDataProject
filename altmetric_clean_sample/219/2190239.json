Independence and self-esteem are strongly determined by physical and mental capacities. Stimulated by reports of declining function with age, investigators have examined the relationships between lifestyle factors and maintenance of functional status. Growing evidence supports the view that continued physical activity and good nutritional status are important determinants of physical and cognitive function. It is possible that some of the decline in cognitive function associated with aging is preventable or reversible with improved vitamin nutriture, especially vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and folate. It might well be argued that the most practical outcome of research on the relationship of diet and nutrition to the aging process would be a better understanding of the ways in which our behavior can maintain a vigorous quality of life.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005700","authors":["I H Rosenberg","J W Miller"],"first_seen_on":"2014-03-17T12:26:01+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1938-3207","0002-9165"],"issue":"6 Suppl","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1395059145,"links":["http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/55\/6\/1237S.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/55\/6\/1237S.full.pdf","pmid":"1590263","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Nutritional factors in physical and cognitive functions of elderly people.","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritional-factors-physical-cognitive-functions-elderly-people-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":2015675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97944,"mean":7.0650260457616,"rank":50296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":25850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97944,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4221,"mean":12.970716587678,"rank":3002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4221,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":15.329538461538,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Chemistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MichelleLunt_\/status\/445536465150156800","license":"public","citation_ids":[2190239],"posted_on":"2014-03-17T12:25:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Monica Michelle","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/631366871334260736\/1LhDIz4-_normal.jpg","description":"L'effort est ma force","id_on_source":"MichelleLunt_","tweeter_id":"186823004","geo":{"lt":38.58157,"ln":-121.4944,"country":"US"},"followers":189},"tweet_id":"445536465150156800"}]}}
