To this purpose, we introduced a novel groupwise fMRI-guided tractographic approach, that was applied on a population ranging between prodromic and moderate stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study comprised of 15 subjects affected by amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 14 diagnosed with AD and 14 elderly healthy adults who were used as controls. By creating representative (ensemble) functionally guided tracts within each group of participants, our methodology highlighted the white matter fiber connections involved in verbal fluency functions for a specific population, and hypothesized on brain compensation mechanisms that potentially counteract or reduce cognitive impairment symptoms in prodromic AD. Our hope is that this fMRI-guided tractographic approach could have potential impact in various clinical studies, while investigating white\/gray matter connectivity, in both health and disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Maria Giulia Preti","Nikos Makris","George Papadimitriou","Maria Marcella Lagan\u00e0","Ludovica Griffanti","Mario Clerici","Raffaello Nemni","Carl-Fredrik Westin","Giuseppe Baselli","Francesca Baglio"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0092026","first_seen_on":"2014-03-17T23:26:55+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1395104154,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092026","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0092026"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0092026.pdf","pmid":"24637718","pubdate":"2014-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e92026","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Novel Approach of Groupwise fMRI-Guided Tractography Allowing to Characterize the Clinical Evolution of Alzheimer's Disease","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-approach-groupwise-fmriguided-tractography-allowing-characterize-clinical-evolution-alzheimers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":2122266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2245227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111870,"mean":7.9980236526655,"rank":49829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":57820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111870,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.426538700851,"rank":38374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":37546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4326,"mean":11.048190520231,"rank":2300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4326,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
