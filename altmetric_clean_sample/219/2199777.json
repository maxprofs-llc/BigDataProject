Roles of HMGA1 in mediating the malignant phenotype of this cancer are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that overexpression of HMGA1 promotes resistance to anoikis (apoptosis induced by anchorage deprivation) in pancreatic cancer cells. HMGA1 cDNA was stably transfected into MiaPaCa2 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (which have low baseline expression levels of HMGA1). Cells were grown in suspension on PolyHEMA-coated plates and their susceptibility to anoikis was assayed using flow cytometry. Overexpression of HMGA1 was associated with marked reductions in susceptibility to anoikis in concert with increases in Akt phosphorylation (Ser473) and in Akt kinase activity and with reductions in caspase 3 activation. Inhibition of phosphoinositidyl-3 (PI3-K)\/Akt pathway with either the small molecule inhibitor LY294002 or dominant-negative Akt resulted in reversal of anoikis resistance induced by HMGA1 overexpression. Further, RNA interference-mediated HMGA1 silencing in MiaPaCa2 and BxPC3 (a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line with high baseline levels of HMGA1 expression) cells resulted in significant increases in susceptibility to anoikis. Our findings suggest HMGA1 promotes anoikis resistance through a PI3-K\/Akt-dependent mechanism. Given the putative associations between anoikis resistance and metastatic potential, HMGA1 represents a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["Liau SS","Jazag A","Ito K","Whang EE","S-S Liau","A Jazag","K Ito","E E Whang"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.bjc.6603654","endpage":"1000","first_seen_on":"2014-03-20T11:32:32+00:00","issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"issue":"6","journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1418040580,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.bjc.6603654"],"pmcid":"PMC2360112","pmid":"17342093","pubdate":"2007-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"993","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Overexpression of HMGA1 promotes anoikis resistance and constitutive Akt activation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/sj.bjc.6603654","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-hmga1-promotes-anoikis-resistance-constitutive-akt-activation-pancreatic-adenocarcino"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":2490801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1553246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110103,"mean":8.4394782656084,"rank":55183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":40229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110103,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2684,"mean":7.2443861349236,"rank":1847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2684,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":9.1719294117647,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
