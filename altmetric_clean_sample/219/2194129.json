The stepladder approach is reviewed, including corticosteroid administration of various forms, classic immunomodulators, and newer biologic response modifiers. The authors present that corticosteroid monotherapy is almost never curative and carries significant side effects, while immunomodulatory therapy, when used appropriately as way to induce steroid-free remission, carries far less risk of causing long-term complications and provides greater potential of altering the immune system to induce a durable remission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52d3d74b86a348c7778b4c58","authors":["Claudia Castiblanco","C.
