The radiating element of the antenna consists of highly conductive and stretchable material with screen-printed silver nanowires embedded in the surface layer of an elastomeric substrate. A 3-GHz microstrip patch antenna and a 6-GHz 2-element patch array are fabricated. Radiating properties of the antennas are characterized under tensile strain and agree well with the simulation results. The antenna is reconfigurable because the resonant frequency is a function of the applied tensile strain. The antenna is thus well suited for applications like wireless strain sensing. The material and fabrication technique reported here could be extended to achieve other types of stretchable antennas with more complex patterns and multilayer structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Lingnan Song","Song L","Myers AC","Adams J","Zhu Y"],"doi":"10.1021\/am405972e","first_seen_on":"2014-03-18T15:05:03+00:00","issns":["1944-8244"],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1395416493,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/am405972e","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/am405972e","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/am405972e","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24593878","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405972e?journalCode=aamick","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405972e","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405972e?prevSearch=Stretchable%2Band%2BReversibly%2BDeformable%2BRadio%2BFrequency%2BAntennas%2BBased%2Bon%2BSilver%2BNanowires&searchHistoryKey=","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am405972e?prevSearch=Stretchable+and+Reversibly+Deformable+Radio+Frequency+Antennas+Based+on+Silver+Nanowires&searchHistoryKey"],"pmid":"24593878","pubdate":"2014-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
