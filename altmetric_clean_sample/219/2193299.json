Unlike bona fide GTPases, which are regulated by intramolecular structural transitions, the less well studied GAD-GTPases are activated by nucleotide-dependent dimerization. A member of this family is the translocase of the outer envelope membrane of chloroplast Toc34 involved in regulation of preprotein import. The GTPase cycle of Toc34 is considered a major circuit of translocation regulation. Contrary to expectations, previous studies yielded only marginal structural changes of dimeric Toc34 in response to different nucleotide loads. Referencing PELDOR and FRET single-molecule and bulk experiments, we describe a nucleotide-dependent transition of the dimer flexibility from a tight GDP- to a flexible GTP-loaded state. Substrate binding induces an opening of the GDP-loaded dimer. Thus, the structural dynamics of bona fide GTPases induced by GTP hydrolysis is replaced by substrate-dependent dimer flexibility, which likely represents a general regulatory mode for dimerizing GTPases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035d2","doi":"10.1016\/j.str.2014.02.004","first_seen_on":"2014-03-18T07:42:58+00:00","issns":["09692126","0969-2126"],"journal":"Structure","last_mentioned_on":1395148918,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0969212614000446","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/structure\/abstract\/S0969-2126(14)00044-6"],"pmid":"24631462","publisher":"Cell Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Nucleotides and Substrates Trigger the Dynamics of the Toc34 GTPase Homodimer Involved in Chloroplast Preprotein Translocation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nucleotides-substrates-trigger-dynamics-toc34-gtpase-homodimer-involved-chloroplast-preprotein-trans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2234347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2745781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127536,"mean":8.2121572901561,"rank":50286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":75568,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127536,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1567,"mean":3.772411238825,"rank":874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1567,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.3648484848485,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
