In Nogo-A knockout and knockdown laboratory rodents, behavioral alterations were observed, possibly corresponding with human neuropsychiatric diseases of neurodevelopmental origin, particularly schizophrenia. This study offers further insight into behavioral manifestations of Nogo-A knockdown in laboratory rats, focusing on spatial and non-spatial cognition, anxiety levels, circadian rhythmicity, and activity patterns. Demonstrated is an impairment of cognitive functions and behavioral flexibility in a spatial active avoidance task, while non-spatial memory in a step-through avoidance task was spared. No signs of anhedonia, typical for schizophrenic patients, were observed in the animals. Some measures indicated lower anxiety levels in the Nogo-A-deficient group. Circadian rhythmicity in locomotor activity was preserved in the Nogo-A knockout rats and their circadian period (tau) did not differ from controls. However, daily activity patterns were slightly altered in the knockdown animals. We conclude that a reduction of Nogo-A levels induces changes in CNS development, manifested as subtle alterations in cognitive functions, emotionality, and activity patterns.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc09","authors":["Petrasek, Tomas","Prokopova, Iva","Sladek, Martin","Weissova, Kamila","Vojtechova, Iveta","Bahnik, Stepan","Zemanova, Anna","Sch\u00f6nig, Kai","Berger, Stefan","Tews, Bj\u00f6rn","Bartsch, Dusan","Schwab, Martin","Sumova, Alena","Stuchlik, Ales"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnbeh.2014.00090","first_seen_on":"2014-03-18T11:33:31+00:00","issns":["1662-5153"],"journal":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1398440169,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fnbeh.2014.00090\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Article\/DownloadFile\/156992\/FLPDF\/fnbeh-08-00090.pdf\/7","pmcid":"PMC3957197","pmid":"24672453","pubdate":"2014-03-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Nogo-A-deficient Transgenic Rats Show Deficits in Higher Cognitive Functions, Decreased Anxiety, and Altered Circadian Activity Patterns","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nogoadeficient-transgenic-rats-show-deficits-higher-cognitive-functions-decreased-anxiety-altered-ci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":2315830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2593064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127530,"mean":8.2126236385454,"rank":52761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":70849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127530,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1031,"mean":5.8632174757282,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":463,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1031,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":3.25,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
