Large numbers of epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical studies on HTLV-I- and HTLV-I-associated diseases have been published, although the pathogenesis of HAM\/TSP remains to be fully understood. In the last several years, researchers have shown that several key factors are important in HTLV-I-associated neurologic disease including high HTLV-I proviral load and a strong immune response to HTLV-I. Here, we review pathophysiological findings on HAM\/TSP and focus on viral-host immune responses to the virus in HTLV-I infected individuals. In particular, the role of HTLV-I-specific CD8+ T cell response is highlighted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d93","authors":["Eiji Matsuura","Yoshihisa Yamano","Steven Jacobson"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11481-010-9216-9","first_seen_on":"2014-03-18T22:29:44+00:00","issns":["1557-1904"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of NeuroImmune Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1395181725,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11481-010-9216-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11481-010-9216-9.pdf","pmid":"20437106","pubdate":"2010-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Neuroimmunity of HTLV-I Infection","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuroimmunity-htlvi-infection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626769,"mean":4.9522514062143,"rank":2907377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626769,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97234,"mean":7.0939976962555,"rank":77345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97234,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165,"mean":4.1197073170732,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.2105263157895,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
