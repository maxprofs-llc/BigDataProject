The wound classification system categorizes all surgeries into: clean, clean\/contaminated, contaminated, and dirty, with estimated postoperative rates of surgical site infection (SSI) being 1%-5%, 3%-11%, 10%-17%, and over 27%, respectively. The present study evaluates the associated rates of the SSI by wound classification using a large risk adjusted surgical patient database.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f48","authors":["Ortega G","Rhee DS","Papandria DJ","Yang J","Ibrahim AM","Shore AD","Makary MA","Abdullah F","Gezzer Ortega","Daniel S.
