Although these RCCs are known to label for melanocytic markers HMB45 and Melan A and the cysteine protease cathepsin K by immunohistochemistry (IHC), a comprehensive IHC profile has not been reported. We report 10 new t(6;11) RCCs, all confirmed by break-apart TFEB fluorescence in situ hybridization. A tissue microarray containing 6 of these cases and 7 other previously reported t(6;11) RCCs was constructed and immunolabeled for 21 different antigens. Additional whole sections of t(6;11) RCC were labeled with selected IHC markers. t(6;11) RCC labeled diffusely and consistently for cathepsin K and Melan A (13 of 13 cases) and almost always at least focally for HMB45 (12 of 13 cases). They labeled frequently for PAX8 (14 of 23 cases), CD117 (10 of 14 cases), and vimentin (9 of 13 cases). A majority of cases labeled at least focally for cytokeratin Cam5.2 (8 of 13 cases) and CD10 and RCC marker antigen (10 of 14 cases each). In contrast to a prior study's findings, only a minority of cases labeled for Ksp-cadherin (3 of 19 cases). The median H score (product of intensity score and percentage labeling) for phosphorylated S6, a marker of mTOR pathway activation, was 101, which is high relative to most other RCC subtypes. In summary, IHC labeling for PAX8, Cam5.2, CD10, and RCC marker antigen supports classification of the t(6;11) RCC as carcinomas despite frequent negativity for broad-spectrum cytokeratins and EMA. Labeling for PAX8 distinguishes the t(6;11) RCC from epithelioid angiomyolipoma, which otherwise shares a similar immunoprofile. CD117 labeling is more frequent in the t(6;11) RCC compared with the related Xp11 translocation RCC. Increased pS6 expression suggests a possible molecular target for the uncommon t(6;11) RCCs that metastasize.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698e","authors":["Smith NE","Illei PB","Allaf M","Gonzalez N","Morris K","Hicks J","Demarzo A","Reuter VE","Amin MB","Epstein JI","Netto GJ","Argani P"],"doi":"10.1097\/pas.0000000000000203","endpage":"614","first_seen_on":"2014-03-17T22:31:48+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0147-5185"],"issue":"5","journal":"The American Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1401272193,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/publishahead\/t_6_11__Renal_Cell_Carcinoma__RCC___Expanded.98678.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24618616?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24618616?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/2014\/05000\/t_6_11__Renal_Cell_Carcinoma__RCC___Expanded.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/9000\/00000\/t_6_11__Renal_Cell_Carcinoma__RCC___Expanded.98678.pdf","pmid":"24618616","pubdate":"2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"604","subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"t(6;11) Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC): Expanded Immunohistochemical Profile Emphasizing Novel RCC Markers and Report of 10 New Genetically Confirmed Cases","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/t611-renal-cell-carcinoma-rcc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6734566,"mean":6.1566710387364,"rank":588417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6145224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6734566,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175960,"mean":7.245958592627,"rank":19079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":156837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175960,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":4.0681442441054,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.0560459770115,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Scientists":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"FR":1,"CA":1,"KE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/histopathology\/status\/444223702671294464","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2191573],"posted_on":"2014-03-13T21:29:18+00:00","author":{"name":"histopathology \ud83d\udd2c","url":"http:\/\/paper.li\/histopathology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/310148433\/pathology_lens_normal.jpg","description":"Issues about tissues","id_on_source":"histopathology","tweeter_id":"56153038","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6000},"tweet_id":"444223702671294464"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mvmd0908\/status\/444226570358489088","license":"public","rt":["histopathology"],"citation_ids":[2191573],"posted_on":"2014-03-13T21:40:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Pathology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3701221689\/4fecd7c62afe6ce7715060e9d6f876a1_normal.jpeg","description":"Dermatopathologist Tweets are not medical advice RT is not endorsement #dermpath #pathology #pathologists","id_on_source":"mvmd0908","tweeter_id":"1444165801","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5520},"tweet_id":"444226570358489088"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PathologyBlog\/status\/446329208885612544","license":"public","rt":["HumanPathology"],"citation_ids":[2191573],"posted_on":"2014-03-19T16:55:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Pathology Blog","url":"http:\/\/bhive.ca\/network","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/700728597250646016\/J6w_ClD0_normal.png","description":"Sharing the latest in the world of #pathology for our tweeps.
