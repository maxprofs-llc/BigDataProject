In this draft, sleep and sexual disorders were not included in mental and behavioural disorders. The World Health Organization decided not to regard them as mental disorders. The primary classification of neurocognitive disorders was also not included in mental and behavioural disorders. In the draft of the linear structure, 25 major categories were classified: neurodevelopmental disorders, disorders of speech and language, schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, catatonia, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, disorders specifically associated with stress, dissociative disorders, bodily distress disorders, and behavioural factors associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere, feeding and eating disorders, elimination disorders, substance intoxication, harmful use of substances, substance dependence, substance withdrawal syndrome, substance-induced mental and behavioural disorders, impulse control disorders, disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, disorders of personality, paraphilic disorders, factitious disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and mental and behavioural disorders associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere. I also introduced the Global Clinical Practice Network (GCPN), which is now being organized by the WHO to carry out field studies for the ICD-11. Over 700 members of the Japanese Society for Psychiatry and Neurology (JSPN) have registered in the GCPN. The ICD-11 committee of the JSPN is very actively building the GCPN and revising the ICD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cf7e","authors":["Toshimasa Maruta"],"first_seen_on":"2014-03-20T10:36:58+00:00","issns":["0033-2658"],"issue":"1","journal":"Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica","last_mentioned_on":1400677100,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24640551?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24640551?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24640551","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"[Recent development of the ICD-11 focusing on the draft of its linear structure].","type":"article","volume":"116","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-development-icd11-focusing-draft-linear-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":2461347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3707459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133090,"mean":8.3237596195029,"rank":53163,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":78269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133090,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.458649122807,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Ph.
