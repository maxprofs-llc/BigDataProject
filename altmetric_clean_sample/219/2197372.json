Nevertheless, radiation exposure remains a serious safety concern. Iterative reconstruction (IR) decreases the CT radiation dose for diagnostic imaging. However, the feasibility of using IR in CTLS is unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a8","authors":["Yang, Cheng Hui","Wu, Tung-Hsin","Chiou, Yi-You","Hung, Sheng-Che","Lin, Chung-Jung","Chen, Ying-Chou","Sheu, Ming-Huei","Guo, Wan-Yuo","Chiu, Chen Fen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.spinee.2014.03.007","first_seen_on":"2014-03-19T14:48:37+00:00","issns":["1529-9430"],"journal":"Spine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1395244133,"links":["http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(14)00248-4\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it","http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(14)00248-4\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.thespinejournalonline.com\/article\/S1529-9430(14)00248-4\/pdf","pmid":"24650849","pubdate":"2014-03-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Imaging Quality and Diagnostic Reliability of Low Dose CT Lumbar Spine for Evaluating Patients with Spinal Disorders","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-quality-diagnostic-reliability-lowdose-computed-tomography-lumbar-spine-evaluating-patients-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1979026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2425182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107161,"mean":8.084164912281,"rank":43447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":60597,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107161,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1520,"mean":2.9040816326531,"rank":526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1520,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":3.6146464646465,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
