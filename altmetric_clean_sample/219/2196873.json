The most described receptor is the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), thereby participating in the S100-dependent cell migration, invasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Several approaches have been described for determining this interaction. Here we describe an easy, specific and highly reproducible ELISA-based method, by optimizing several parameters such as the binding and blocking buffer, interaction time and concentrations, directed to screen chemical and biological inhibitors of this interaction for S100A4, S100A7 and S100P proteins. The efficiency of the protocol was validated by using well described neutralizing agents of the RAGE receptor and of the S100A4 activity. The methodology described here will allow future works with other members of the S100 protein family and their receptors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2014.02.143","first_seen_on":"2014-03-19T11:36:52+00:00","issns":["0006291X"],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1395228269,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006291X14004288"],"pmid":"24613850","publisher":"Academic Press Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"S100 to receptor for advanced glycation end-products binding assay: Looking for inhibitors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/s100-receptor-advanced-glycation-endproducts-binding-assay-looking-inhibitors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229690,"mean":5.9663798423984,"rank":2926648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229690,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132740,"mean":8.3256922532189,"rank":66425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":49261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132740,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7436,"mean":2.5722453261601,"rank":5002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7436,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.3085974025974,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
