It is a multi-domain scaffold protein characterized by multiple leucine-rich repeat domains plus a single Psd95\/Discs large\/Zona occludens-1 domain. In its original topology model a single transmembrane segment was proposed with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus. However, recently discovered in vivo phosphorylation sites are incompatible with this topology. Here, we discuss an all-intracellular and membrane-associated localization of Densin-180 that is consistent with and supported by all the latest experimental data. This revised topology which now includes also a phosphorylation-rich area will have deciding influence on future research involving Densin-180 and its signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Thalhammer, Agnes","Trinidad, Jonathan C.","Burlingame, Alma L.","Schoepfer, Ralf"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2009.05951.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T12:09:16+00:00","issns":["1471-4159"],"journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1246884468,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2009.05951.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19187442","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2846389"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2009.05951.x\/pdf","pmid":"19187442","pubdate":"2009-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Densin-180: revised membrane topology, domain structure and phosphorylation status","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/densin180-revised-membrane-topology-domain-structure-phosphorylation-status"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4016167,"mean":5.0291818916421,"rank":921094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2538715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4016167,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127900,"mean":9.1145250005866,"rank":38937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":87167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127900,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1910,"mean":2.1394290204295,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1910,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.6893725490196,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
