Unique IPM glycoconjugates are distributed around rods and cones. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) strongly decorates the rod matrix domains and weakly decorates the cone matrix domains. This study characterizes the major WGA-binding glycoprotein in the human IPM, which we refer to as SPACR (sialoprotein associated with cones and rods). SPACR, which has a molecular weight of 147 kDa, was isolated and purified from the IPM by lectin affinity chromatography. A polyclonal antibody to SPACR was prepared that colocalizes in tissue preparations with WGA-binding domains in the IPM. Sequential digestion of SPACR with N- and O-glycosidases results in a systematic increase in electrophorectic mobility, indicating the presence of both N- and O-linked glycoconjugates. Complete deglycosylation results in a reduction in the relative molecular mass of SPACR by about 30%. Analysis of lectin binding allowed us to identify some of the structural characteristics of SPACR glycoconjugates. Treatment with neuraminidase exposes Galbeta1-3GalNAc disaccharide as indicated by positive peanut agglutinin (PNA) staining, accompanied by the loss of WGA staining. Maackia amurensis agglutinins (MAA-1 and MAA-2), specific for sialic acid in alpha2-3 linkage to Gal, bind SPACR, while Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), specific for alpha2-6 linked sialic acid, does not, indicating that the dominant glycoconjugate determinant on SPACR is the O-linked carbohydrate, NeuAcalpha2-3Galbeta1-3GalNAc. The abundance of sialic acid in SPACR suggests that this glycoprotein may contribute substantially to the polyanionic nature of the IPM. The carbohydrate chains present on SPACR could also provide sites for extensive crosslinking and participate in the formation of the ordered IPM lattice that surrounds the elongate photoreceptors projecting from the outer retinal surface.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000297c","authors":["Shreeta Acharya","Mary E.
