However, in this report, we demonstrate that Trip6 is largely in the nucleus in cells treated with leptomycin B, suggesting that Trip6 shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments and that nuclear export of Trip6 is dependent on Crm1. Consistent with this finding, we have identified a nuclear export signal (NES) in Trip6, and mutation of this NES also results in sequestration of Trip6 in the nucleus. Addition of the Trip6 NES to the nuclear v-Rel oncoprotein redirects v-Rel to the cytoplasm. Trip6 also has at least two sequences that can direct cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase to the nucleus. Using GAL4 fusion proteins and reporter gene assays, we demonstrate that Trip6 has multiple transactivation domains, including one that appears to overlap with sequences of the NES. In vitro- or in vivo-synthesized Trip6, however, does not bind to DNA-cellulose. Taken together, these results are consistent with Trip6, and other members of this LIM protein family, having a role in relaying signals between focal adhesion plaques and the nucleus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Y Wang","T D Gilmore"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T19:16:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"2-3","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1198007736,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11336797"],"pmid":"11336797","pubdate":"2001-04-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"LIM domain protein Trip6 has a conserved nuclear export signal, nuclear targeting sequences, and multiple transactivation domains.","type":"article","volume":"1538","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lim-domain-protein-trip6-conserved-nuclear-export-signal-nuclear-targeting-sequences-multiple-transa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95994,"mean":8.2443630473058,"rank":25067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95994,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5358244611789,"rank":256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":0.90077669902913,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
