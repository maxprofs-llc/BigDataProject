Enzymatically inactive PIKfyve mutants elicit enormous dilation of late endocytic structures, suggesting a role for PIKfyve in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) membrane retrieval. Here we report that p40, a Rab9 effector reported previously to bind Rab9-GTP and stimulate endosome-to-TGN transport, interacts with PIKfyve as determined by yeast two-hybrid assays, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation in doubly transfected HEK293 cells. The interaction engages the PIKfyve chaperonin domain and four out of the six C-terminally positioned kelch repeats in p40. Differential centrifugation in a HEK293 cell line, stably expressing PIKfyveWT, showed the membrane-associated immunoreactive p40 co-sedimenting with PIKfyve in the high speed pellet (HSP) fraction. Remarkably, similar analysis in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing dominant-negative kinase-deficient PIKfyveK1831E demonstrated a marked depletion of p40 from the HSP fraction. GST-p40 failed to specifically associate with the PIKfyve lipid products PtdIns 5-P and PtdIns 3,5-P2 in a liposome binding assay but was found to be an in vitro substrate of the PIKfyve serine kinase activity. A band with the p40 electrophoretic mobility was found to react with a phosphoserine-specific antibody mainly in the PIKfyveWT-containing fractions obtained by density gradient sedimentation of total membranes from PIKfyveWT-expressing HEK293 cells. Together these results identify the Rab9 effector p40 as a PIKfyve partner and suggest that p40-PIKfyve interaction and the subsequent PIKfyve-catalyzed p40 phosphorylation anchor p40 to discrete membranes facilitating late endosome-to-TGN transport.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Ognian C.
