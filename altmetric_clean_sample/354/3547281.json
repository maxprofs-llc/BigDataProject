Eleven qualitative and 39 quantitative meta-analyses were reviewed examining reading research with typically developing hearing students, special education hearing students (including English Language Learners), and d\/Deaf or hard of hearing (d\/Dhh) students. Generally, the meta-analysis yielded findings similar to and corroborative of the NRP's. Contradictory results (e.g., regarding the role of rhyme awareness in reading outcomes) most often resulted from differing definitions of interventions and their measurements. The analysis provided evidence of several instructional approaches that support reading development. On the basis of the qualitative similarity hypothesis (Paul, 2010, 2012; Paul & Lee, 2010; Paul & Wang, 2012; Paul, Wang, & Williams, 2013), the researchers argue that these instructional strategies also should effectively support d\/Dhh children's reading development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021db","authors":["Ye Wang","Cheri Williams"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T18:49:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-726X"],"issue":"4","journal":"American Annals of the Deaf","last_mentioned_on":1423775255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25669016?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25669016?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25669016","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Are we hammering square pegs into round holes?
