The gene codes for a 30 kD, post-synthetically modified protein located primarily in the mitochondria. It functionally inhibits cell cycle traverse and DNA synthesis, but its mechanism of action is presently unknown. Prohibitin is proposed to be a member of a new class of tumor suppressor genes whose inhibitory activity plays a role in the dominant senescent phenotype. Its involvement in senescence has been postulated from results obtained from such diverse systems as yeast and human diploid fibroblasts. Additional data show that prohibitin is involved in one of the limited number of pathways that results in the loss of the senescent phenotype and leads to cellular immortalization. Its involvement, however, occurs downstream in the pathway and is postulated to be part of the lost tumor suppressor activities associated with tumorigenicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002894","authors":["R T Dell'Orco","J K McClung","E R Jupe","X T Liu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:05:42+00:00","issns":["0531-5565"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Experimental Gerontology","last_mentioned_on":1197771978,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8706794"],"pmid":"8706794","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Prohibitin and the senescent phenotype.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prohibitin-senescent-phenotype"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627846,"mean":4.9453817817504,"rank":817402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627846,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95055,"mean":8.1479061586047,"rank":24662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95055,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":555,"mean":4.268844765343,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":555,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":5.8071428571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
