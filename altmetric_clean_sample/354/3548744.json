We screened a group of 165 early onset ataxia patients for APTX mutations and detected two non-related patients homozygous for the W293X nonsense mutation. Additionally, we describe several new transcript variants of the APTX gene and discuss their relevance for a sufficient mutation screening.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e77","authors":["Matthias Habeck","Christine Z\u00fchlke","Karl H.
