Although there are only 24 amino acid differences between hCRM1 and rat CRM1 (rCRM1), rCRM1 can hardly support Rex activity, suggesting a role for rCRM1 as a determinant restricting the host range of HTLV-1. Here, we used a series of mutants, which were generated by interchanging residues of these CRM1s, to examine the relationship of hCRM1 functions. The functions for Rex multimerization and binding to nuclear export signals are mapped to different amino acid residues, and these are separable, suggesting that CRM1 not only functions as an export receptor but also participates in the formation of the RNA export complex through higher-ordered interaction with Rex. The region for the interaction with RanBP3, comprising four residues (amino acids [aa] 411, 414, 474, and 481), and the region for Rex multimerization, including two residues (aa 411 and 414), form an overlapped domain. Our results provide the molecular basis underlying the species-specific ability of HTLV-1 to propagate in human cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Yoshiyuki Hakata","Masami Yamada","Hisatoshi Shida"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.23.23.8751-8761.2003","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T12:03:39+00:00","issns":["1098-5549"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1198573668,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/MCB.23.23.8751-8761.2003","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14612415","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC262658"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/content\/23\/23\/8751.full.pdf","pmid":"14612415","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"A Multifunctional Domain in Human CRM1 (Exportin 1) Mediates RanBP3 Binding and Multimerization of Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type 1 Rex Protein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multifunctional-domain-human-crm1-exportin-1-mediates-ranbp3-binding-multimerization-human-tcell-leu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9287830669226,"rank":815409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93338,"mean":7.2259655227831,"rank":23668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93338,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3660,"mean":2.4918863077344,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":1375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3660,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.0077777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
