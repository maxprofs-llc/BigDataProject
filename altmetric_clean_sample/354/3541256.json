This binding was strongly increased by the presence of sodium taurocholate, giving an apparent dissociation constant of around 10(-7) M. With this constant, significant binding is expected to occur in the intestine of the newborn being breast-fed between lactoferrin and either the pancreatic carboxylester hydrolase or the milk bile-salt-stimulated lipase. For carboxylester hydrolase, the interaction with lactoferrin meant a 1.4-fold increase in hydrolytic activity against p-nitrophenylacetate and cholesterololeate. For the function of lactoferrin we have not studied the importance of this interaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["C Erlanson-Albertsson","B Sternby","U Johannesson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:07:26+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1203197821,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3995055"],"pmid":"3995055","pubdate":"1985-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"The interaction between human pancreatic carboxylester hydrolase (bile-salt-stimulated lipase of human milk) and lactoferrin.","type":"article","volume":"829","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-between-human-pancreatic-carboxylester-hydrolase-bilesaltstimulated-lipase-human-milk-la"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9307173704291,"rank":816009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282731,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94096,"mean":7.397535932153,"rank":23932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94096,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5443292651259,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":0.92409523809524,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Bile salt-dependent lipase","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=191930262#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3541255,3541256],"posted_on":"2008-02-16T21:37:01+00:00","summary":"Bile salt-dependent lipase (or BSDL), also known as carboxyl ester lipase (or CEL) is an enzyme produced by the adult pancreas and aids in the digestion of fats.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13987887","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
