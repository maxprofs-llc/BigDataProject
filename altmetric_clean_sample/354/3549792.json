Hypoxia appears to play an important role as a contributory factor. Infantile hemangiomas have variable clinical features: superficial, deep or mixed. They can be localized or segmental involving a large skin area. Localized infantile hemangiomas are usually benign, unless they are located near a noble structure (airway orbit...), while segmental infantile hemangioma may be associated with complex underlying birth defects (PHACES and SACRAL syndromes). Clinical follow-up of infants with infantile hemangioma must be particularly careful in the first weeks of life since 80% of all infantile hemangiomas have reached their final size at age 5 months. A majority of infantile hemangiomas are mild and do not required any treatment. Main indications for treatment are: vital risk (heart failure, respiratory distress), functional risk (amblyopia, swallowing disorders...), painful ulceration and disfigurement (face involvement of nose, lips...). Propranolol, has been quickly adopted as the first line medical treatment for complicated infantile hemangioma; and it is the only treatment to have a marketing authorization in this indication. It is recommended to begin the treatment as early as possible before three months of age to minimize the risk of complications and sequelae.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9263cf058f61000dcf6","authors":["Christine Leaute-Labreze"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T19:38:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0035-2640"],"issue":"10","journal":"Revue du praticien","last_mentioned_on":1423696295,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25665327?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25665327","pubdate":"2014-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Infantile hemangiomas].","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infantile-hemangiomas-revolution-betablockers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":3975013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169712,"mean":8.8215020829531,"rank":136948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169712,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.3635344827586,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.66071428571429,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
