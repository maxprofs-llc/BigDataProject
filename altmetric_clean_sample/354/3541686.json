In turn, subcellular targeting, protein-protein interactions, or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may shape RGS activity and specificity. We found previously that RGS16 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box. Phosphorylation on Tyr(168) was mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We show here that endogenous RGS16 is phosphorylated after epidermal growth factor stimulation of MCF-7 cells. In addition, p60-Src or Lyn kinase phosphorylated recombinant RGS16 in vitro, and RGS16 underwent phosphorylation in the presence of constitutively active Src (Y529F) in EGFR(-) CHO-K1 cells. Blockade of endogenous Src activity by selective inhibitors attenuated RGS16 phosphorylation induced by pervanadate or receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the rate of RGS16 degradation was reduced in cells expressing active Src or treated with pervanadate or a G protein-coupled receptor ligand (CXCL12). Induction of RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with increased RGS16 protein levels and enhanced GAP activity in cell membranes. These results suggest that Src mediates RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation, which may promote RGS16 stability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["A.
