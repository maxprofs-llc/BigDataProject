This may lead to inequities in access to care, especially for clients considered as low priority, who tend to bear the brunt of lengthy waiting lists. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe waiting list management practices targeting low-priority clients\u00a0in home-based occupational therapy in the province of Quebec, Canada, and to investigate the association between these practices and the length of the waiting list. A structured telephone interview was conducted in 2012-2013 with the person who manages the occupational therapy waiting list in 55 home care programmes across Quebec. Questions pertained to strategies aimed at servicing low-priority clients, the date of the oldest referral and the number of clients waiting. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests. The median wait time for the oldest referral was 18\u00a0months (range: 2-108\u00a0months). A variety of strategies were used to service low-priority clients. Programmes that used no strategies to service low-priority clients (n\u00a0=\u00a016) had longer wait times (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and a greater number of people on the waiting list (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) compared with programmes that applied a maximum wait time target (n\u00a0=\u00a012). In conclusion, diverse strategies exist to allocate services to low-priority clients in home-based occupational therapy programmes. However, in programmes where none of these strategies are used, low-priority clients may be denied access to services indefinitely.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b8","authors":["Raymond, Marie\u2010H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","Demers, Louise","Feldman, Debbie E.","Raymond MH","Demers
