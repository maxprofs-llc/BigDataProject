Incubation of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)cysteine with the enzyme preparation yielded 2,4-dinitrobenzenethiol, pyruvic acid, and NH3 at equimolar ratios, indicating that the thioether cleavage probably proceeds via an alpha,beta elimination reaction. The thiol product was methylated and the methylated derivative 1-methylthio-2,4-dinitrobenzene, was identified by mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy. The Km value of S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)cysteine was 0.5 mM at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer. The enzyme activity was inhibited by hydroxylamine. No cofactor requirement was observed. A combination of the partially purified enzyme and hepatic microsomes that contain thiol methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.9) converted cysteine conjugates of 2,4-dinitrobenzene and p-bromobenzene to the corresponding methylthio-containing metabolites; S-adenosylmethionine was required. An important role of this novel beta-lyase enzyme in the formation of methylthio-containing metabolites of various drugs is indicated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["M Tateishi","S Suzuki","H Shimizu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T19:36:46+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1194916249,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/721818"],"pmid":"721818","pubdate":"1978-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase in rat liver.
