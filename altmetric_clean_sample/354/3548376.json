IKAChis composed of two inward rectifier K+ channel subunits, GIRK1 and GIRK4. Gbeta gamma binds to both GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits of the heteromultimeric IKACh. Here we delineate the Gbeta gamma binding regions of IKACh by studying direct Gbeta gamma interaction with native purified IKACh, competition of this interaction with peptides derived from GIRK1 or GIRK4 amino acid sequences, mutational analysis of regions implicated in Gbeta gamma binding, and functional expression of mutated subunits in mammalian cells. Only two GIRK4 peptides, containing amino acids 209-225 or 226-245, effectively competed for Gbeta gamma binding. A single point mutation introduced into GIRK4 at position 216 (C216T) dramatically reduced the potency of the peptide in inhibiting Gbeta gamma binding and Gbeta gamma activation of expressed GIRK1\/GIRK4(C216T) channels. Conversion of 5 amino acids in GIRK4 (226-245) to the corresponding amino acids found in the G protein-insensitive IRK1 channel, completely abolished peptide inhibition of Gbeta gamma binding to IKACh and Gbeta gamma activation of GIRK1\/mutant GIRK4 channels. We conclude from this data that Gbeta gamma binding to GIRK4 is critical for IKACh activation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Grigory Krapivinsky","Matthew E.
