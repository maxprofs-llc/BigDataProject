BGP I is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, which is a subfamily in the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. The deduced amino acid sequence of the combined clones for BGP I revealed a 34-residue leader sequence followed by a 108-residue N-terminal domain, a 178-residue immunoglobulin-like domain, a 108-residue region specific to BGP I, a 24-residue transmembrane domain, and a 35-residue cytoplasmic domain. The nucleotide sequence of BGP I exhibited greater than 80% identity with CEA and nonspecific crossreacting antigen (NCA) in the leader peptide, N-terminal domain, and immunoglobulin-like domain. The BGP I-specific domain, designated A', was 56.7% and 55.8% identical at the nucleotide level and 42.6% and 39.6% identical at the amino acid level to the immunoglobulin-like domain of NCA and the first immunoglobulin-like domain of CEA, respectively. Beyond nucleotide position 1375 the 3' region of the BGP I cDNA was found to be specific for BGP I. Hybridization of a probe from this region to electrophoretic blots of RNAs from different human tissues showed a predominant 2.8-kilobase (kb) message accompanied by weaker bands 4.1 and 2.1 kb in size. The same probe gave a single band in Southern blot analysis of restricted total human DNA. Using a coding region probe from the BGP I domain A', we observed 4.1- and 2.1-kb messages. Lack of the 2.8-kb band suggested that different forms of BGP I may be generated by posttranscriptional modification of the same gene. We propose that BGP I diverged from NCA by acquiring an immunoglobulin-like domain substantially different from the domains found in NCA or CEA and also a new cytoplasmic domain. The latter feature should result in a substantially different membrane anchorage mechanism of BGP I compared to CEA, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain and is anchored via a phosphatidylinositol-glycan structure. Protein structural analysis of BGP I isolated from human bile revealed a blocked N terminus, 129 amino acids of internal sequence that are in agreement with the translated cDNA sequence, and five glycosylation sites in the peptides sequenced.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1988PNAS...85.6959H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Y Hinoda","M Neumaier","S A Hefta","Z Drzeniek","C Wagener","L Shively","L J Hefta","J E Shively","R J Paxton"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.85.18.6959","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:01:51+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"18","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1197756623,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.85.18.6959","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2457922","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC282098"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/85\/18\/6959.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC282098","pmid":"2457922","pubdate":"1988-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Molecular cloning of a cDNA coding biliary glycoprotein I: primary structure of a glycoprotein immunologically crossreactive with carcinoembryonic antigen.","type":"article","volume":"85","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ccam1-candidate-tumor-suppressor-gene-abnormally-expressed-primary-lung-cancers-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":817692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94926,"mean":8.1252472162234,"rank":24611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69226,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94926,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33575,"mean":13.663879311372,"rank":13019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":13698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33575,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":904,"mean":37.483833887043,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":904,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
