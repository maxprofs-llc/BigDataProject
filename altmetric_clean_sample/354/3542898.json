This study also aims to determine the effects of glyphosate exposure on liver tissue damage and swimming performance due to short term (2.5, 5 and 10 mg\/L) and long term (2.5 and 5 mg\/L) exposures. Following pesticide administration, ten fish, each as a sample, were caught at 6th, 12th, 24th, 48th and 96th -h for the short term, and at 21st day for the long term exposure study. GPx activity was found to be significantly induced 12 h after the exposure to 2.5 mg\/L of glyphosate as compared with the control group. A similar degree of induction was also observed for CAT activity but not for SOD. For long term exposure, except for the GPx activity after exposure to 5 mg\/L of glyphosate, the activities of all other enzymes remained on a par with the control group. It was also observed that the levels of gene expression of these enzymes were not comparable with each other. It is assumed that these differences might result from the effect of glyphosate before translation and the possible reasons for this scenario are also discussed. The results of swimming performance are found to be consistent with responses of the antioxidant system, and they are attributed to the energy metabolism. The data are also supported with liver histopathology analysis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065db","doi":"10.1016\/j.ecoenv.2014.09.027","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:59:49+00:00","issns":["01476513"],"journal":"Ecotoxicology & Environmental Safety","last_mentioned_on":1424931564,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0147651314004448"],"pmid":"25450935","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Effects of glyphosate on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): Transcriptional and enzymatic analyses of antioxidant defence system, histopathological liver damage and swimming performance ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-glyphosate-juvenile-rainbow-trout-oncorhynchus-mykiss-transcriptional-enzymatic-analyses-ant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4809146,"mean":5.7500569465082,"rank":2553333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1602774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4809146,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172966,"mean":8.7833515913626,"rank":91409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172966,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":572,"mean":2.1972084063047,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":572,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.08,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
