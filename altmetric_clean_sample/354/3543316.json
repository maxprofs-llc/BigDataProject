The involvement of Bcl-2 and some Bcl-2-binding proteins in differentiation has recently been reported. However, the relevance of Bis to cellular differentiation remains unknown. The findings herein show that Bis expression is up-regulated during the differentiation of HL-60 cells. To investigate the effect of Bis expression on differentiation, we established Bis-overexpressing HL-60 cells (HL-60-bis). HL-60-bis cells have a low nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio and indented nucleus in Wright- Giemsa staining, and an increased expression of CD11b in immunofluorescence study, indicating the promotion of differentiation. The overexpression of Bis also resulted in a retarded cell growth rate, accompanied by the accumulation of HL-60 cells at the G0\/G1 phase of the cell cycle, which was sustained during the differentiation process. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of p27, a representative inducer of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, was increased 2.5-fold in HL-60-bis cells compared to HL-60-neo cells. These results suggest that the Bis induced growth inhibition of HL-60 cells promotes G0\/G1 phase arrest via up-regulation of p27, which seems to be a prerequisite for differentiation. Further studies will be required to define the exact roles of Bis on cellular differentiation more precisely.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b5","authors":["Seo YJ","Jeon MH","Lee JH","Lee YJ","Youn HJ","Ko JH","Lee JH"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T12:13:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Experimental and Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1460401688,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16391524"],"pmid":"16391524","pubdate":"2006-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Bis induces growth inhibition and differentiation of HL-60 cells via up-regulation of p27.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bis-induces-growth-inhibition-differentiation-hl60-cells-via-upregulation-p27"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":1821127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4707019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238268,"mean":8.1515395165928,"rank":67509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238268,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":310,"mean":2.9012621359223,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":310,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":8.5027777777778,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"BAG3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178789567#altmetric_citation_18","license":"public","citation_ids":[3543315,3543316],"posted_on":"2016-04-11T19:08:08+00:00","summary":"PLCG1 has been shown to interact with: FGFR1, CD117, CD31, Cbl gene CISHEpidermal growth factor receptor, Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, FLT1, GAB1, GIT1, Grb2, HER2\/neu, IRS2, ITK, KHDRBS1, Linker of activated T cells, Lymphocyte cyto","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14769961","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ChinHT","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ChinHT"}}]}}
