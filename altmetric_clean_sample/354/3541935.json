The MUC1 oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas and associates with beta-catenin. However, the functional significance of the MUC1-beta-catenin interaction is not known. Here, we show that MUC1 increases beta-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus of carcinoma cells. Previous studies have shown that glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) phosphorylates beta-catenin and thereby targets it for proteosomal degradation. Consistent with the up-regulation of beta-catenin levels, our results show that MUC1 blocks GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin. To further define the interaction between MUC1 and beta-catenin, we identified a serine-rich motif (SRM) in the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain that binds directly to beta-catenin Armadillo repeats. Mutation of the SRM attenuated binding of MUC1 to beta-catenin and MUC1-mediated inhibition of beta-catenin degradation. Importantly, disruption of the MUC1-beta-catenin interaction with the SRM mutant also attenuated MUC1-induced anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and delayed MUC1-mediated tumorigenicity. These findings indicate that MUC1 promotes transformation, at least in part, by blocking GSK3beta-mediated phosphorylation and thereby degradation of beta-catenin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Lei Huang","Dongshu Chen","Derek Liu","Li Yin","Surender Kharbanda","Donald Kufe"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-05-2474","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:29:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1538-7445","0008-5472"],"issue":"22","journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1304461037,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-05-2474","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16288032"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/65\/22\/10413.full.pdf","pmid":"16288032","pubdate":"2005-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MUC1 oncoprotein blocks glycogen synthase kinase 3beta-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/muc1-oncoprotein-blocks-glycogen-synthase-kinase-3%CE%B2mediated-phosphorylation-degradation-%CE%B2catenin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":816065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95796,"mean":8.2129371887888,"rank":24980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95796,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4933,"mean":4.0832502027575,"rank":933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4933,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":2.8175068493151,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
