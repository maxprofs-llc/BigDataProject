Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the cDNA inserts. PCR products were purified and used in cycle sequencing reactions in the presence of a fluorescein-conjugated primer and electrophoresed on a Pharmacia A.L.F. Sequencer. Partial cDNA sequences, or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were searched against the Genbank and EMBL databases to identify novel genes expressed in the human cardiovascular system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5b","doi":"10.1006\/jmcc.1994.1151","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T11:25:12+00:00","issns":["0022-2828"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1198027333,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/jmcc.1994.1151","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7869393"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jmmc-online.com\/article\/S0022282884711515\/pdf","pmid":"7869393","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","cardiology"],"title":"Single pass sequencing of a unidirectional human fetal heart cDNA library to discover novel genes of the cardiovascular system.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/single-pass-sequencing-unidirectional-human-fetal-heart-cdna-library-discover-novel-genes-cardiovasc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9312868762118,"rank":816084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2282647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94092,"mean":7.393958359018,"rank":23929,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94092,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":396,"mean":2.0873974683544,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":396,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":1.6151515151515,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
