Proper chromosome segregation requires a physical connection between spindle microtubules and centromeric DNA and this attachment occurs at proteinaceous structures called kinetochore. Several centromere proteins such as CENP-A and CENP-H are the fundamental components of the human active kinetochore, and inappropriate expression of the centromere proteins could be a major cause of CIN. We have previously shown that CENP-A was overexpressed in primary human colorectal cancer. In this study, we show that CENP-H was also up-regulated in all of 15 primary human colorectal cancer tissues as well as in CIN tumor cell lines. Surprisingly, transient transfection of CENP-H expression plasmid into the diploid cell line HCT116 remarkably induced aneupoidy. Moreover, CENP-H stable transfectant of mouse embryonic fibroblast\/3T3 cell lines showed aberrant interphase micronuclei, characteristic of chromosome missegregation. In these CENP-H overexpressed cells, CENP-H completely disappeared from the centromere of mitotic chromosomes, which might be the cause of the chromosome segregation defect. These results suggest that the aberrant expression and localization of a kinetochore protein CENP-H plays an important role in the aneuploidy frequently observed in colorectal cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd4","authors":["Takeshi Tomonaga","Kazuyuki Matsushita","Masumi Ishibashi","Masahiko Nezu","Hideaki Shimada","Takenori Ochiai","Kinya Yoda","Fumio Nomura"],"doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-04-3613","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T12:09:52+00:00","issns":["1538-7445"],"journal":"Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1198592860,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-04-3613","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15930286"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerres.aacrjournals.org\/content\/65\/11\/4683.full.pdf","pmid":"15930286","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Centromere protein H is up-regulated in primary human colorectal cancer and its overexpression induces aneuploidy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/centromere-protein-h-upregulated-primary-human-colorectal-cancer-overexpression-induces-aneuploidy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9279282509359,"rank":815427,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93348,"mean":7.2253381897651,"rank":23669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93348,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4928,"mean":4.1291804343414,"rank":931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4928,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.8431594202899,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
