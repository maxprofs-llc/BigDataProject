Thirty patients received femoral nerve block and the other 30 received adductor canal block for postoperative pain control. Before spinal anesthesia, the patients received nerve block via a catheter (20 mL 0.75% ropivacaine was administered initially, followed by intermittent bolus injection of 10 mL 0.2% ropivacaine every 6 hours for 3 days). The catheters were maintained in the exact location of nerve block in 24 patients in the femoral nerve block group and in 19 patients in the adductor canal block group. Data collection was carried out from these 43 patients. To evaluate postoperative pain control, the numerical rating scale scores at rest and 45\u00b0 flexion of the knee were recorded. To evaluate quadriceps strength, manual muscle testing was performed. Walking ability was assessed using the Timed Up and Go test. We also evaluated analgesic consumption and complications of peripheral nerve block.\nNo significant intergroup difference was observed in the numerical rating scale scores at rest and 45\u00b0 flexion of the knee on postoperative days 1, 2, 3, and 7. The adductor canal block group had significantly greater quadriceps strength than did the femoral nerve block group, as assessed by manual muscle testing on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. The 2 groups showed no difference in walking ability on postoperative day 1, but on postoperative days 2, 3, walking ability was significantly better in the adductor canal block group than in the femoral nerve block group. No significant intergroup difference was observed in analgesic consumption.\nThe groups showed no difference in postoperative pain control. Adductor canal block was superior to femoral nerve block in preserving quadriceps strength and walking ability. However, adductor canal block was inferior to femoral nerve block in maintaining the exact location of the catheter.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bbf7","authors":["Seung Suk Seo","Ok Gul Kim","Jin Hyeok Seo","Do Hoon Kim","Youn Gu Kim","Beyoung Yun Park"],"doi":"10.4055\/cios.2017.9.3.303","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T10:18:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2005-291X","2005-4408"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinics in Orthopedic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1504347513,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28861197?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC5567025","pmid":"28861197","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Comparison of the Effect of Continuous Femoral Nerve Block and Adductor Canal Block after Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty","type":"article","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173975,"mean":12.355259923897,"rank":142102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173975,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.2443373493976,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/903925105528418304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24664164],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T10:18:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
