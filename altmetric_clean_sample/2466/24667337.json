The present study is aimed at evaluating the accident mechanisms, injuries of the upper limbs, and the circumstances of the accident in equestrian sports. We included 218 patients who were all treated between 2006 and 2014\u2009at the level\u00a0I trauma center at the Medical University in Hannover because of equestrian-related accidents. The most frequent injuries were fractures and bruising in the shoulder area, fingers and hands, and the distal area of the lower arm, which were mostly caused by the horse kicking. To prevent hand injuries it is recommended that gloves are worn; the potential introduction of strengthened materials could protect the bones from severe bumping. Training in falling techniques to prevent serious injury to the upper limb would be useful. In general, primary prevention in equestrian sports should be extended to counteract the increasing neglect of protective equipment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c2a","authors":["C.
