Here, we employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach to profile the interaction proteomes of three well-defined G4 structures derived from the human telomere and the promoters of cMYC and cKIT genes. We identified SLIRP as a novel G4-interacting protein. We also demonstrated that the protein could bind directly with G4 DNA with Kd values in the low nanomolar range and revealed that the robust binding of the protein toward G4 DNA requires its RRM domain. We further assessed, by using CRISPR-Cas9-introduced affinity tag and ChIP-Seq analysis, the genome-wide occupancy of SLIRP, and showed that the protein binds preferentially to G-rich DNA sequences that can fold into G4 structures. Together, our results uncovered a novel cellular protein that can interact directly with G4 DNA, which underscored the complex regulatory networks involved in G4 biology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Williams, Preston B.","Li, Lin","Dong, Xiaoli","Wang, Yinsheng","Preston Williams","Lin Li","Xiaoli Dong","Yinsheng Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.7b07563","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T10:18:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1504974288,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28859475?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/jacs.7b07563"],"pmid":"28859475","pubdate":"2017-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Identification of SLIRP as a G Quadruplex-binding Protein","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-slirp-g-quadruplexbinding-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389558,"mean":7.0669301492244,"rank":3863349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4442207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389558,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135127,"mean":12.269883530927,"rank":57230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":75678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135127,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19287,"mean":5.3083380690656,"rank":11827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":7279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19287,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":9.2363717948718,"rank":103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
