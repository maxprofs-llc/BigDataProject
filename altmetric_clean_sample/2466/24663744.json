Major clinical manifestations included lung and bone injuries, and other vital organs were functionally unaffected by the disease. After a careful observation for the disease progression, he underwent bilateral deceased-donor lung transplantation. He has returned to his normal social life and is doing well without recurrence of Erdheim-Chester disease in the lung allograft or progression in other organs 5 years after transplant. Lung transplantation is a potentially reasonable treatment option for Erdheim-Chester disease involving the lungs if the functions of other vital organs remain stable.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Kohei Hashimoto","Kentaroh Miyoshi","Hisao Mizutani","Shinji Otani","Seiichiro Sugimoto","Masaomi Yamane","Takahiro Oto"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2017.02.020","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T10:08:35+00:00","issns":["00034975"],"issue":"1","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1504346957,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28633251?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28633251","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Successful Lung Transplantation for Pulmonary Disease Associated With Erdheim\u2013Chester Disease","type":"article","volume":"104"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6116442,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2041340,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173975,"mean":12.355257049904,"rank":112708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":50865,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173975,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3513,"mean":4.0152625284738,"rank":1804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1542,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3513,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":18.355833333333,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/s_mankin\/statuses\/903922541303144448","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24663744],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T10:08:22+00:00","author":{"name":"J Mankin","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"s_mankin","tweeter_id":"3193664917","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":11},"tweet_id":"903922541303144448"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jmankin\/statuses\/903922772992249856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24663744],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T10:09:17+00:00","author":{"name":"jmankin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/488481521267789825\/73To-FPA_normal.png","id_on_source":"jmankin","tweeter_id":"14104509","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":122},"tweet_id":"903922772992249856"}]}}
