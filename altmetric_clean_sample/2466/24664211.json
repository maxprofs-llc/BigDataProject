Serological assays to detect anti-PDCoV antibodies are presently limited to certain laboratories and geographic regions. In this study, a recombinant M protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV-rM ELISA) was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG in Hebei province. The PDCoV-rM ELISA showed no cross-reaction with antisera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The diagnostic sensitivity was 90.6% and the diagnostic specificity was 93.3%. A total of 871 serum samples collected in Hebei from January 2015 to October 2016 were checked for presence of antibodies against PDCoV using the novel PDCoV-rM ELISA. Anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in 11% (96\/871) of the samples and in 25% (10\/40) of the investigated farms. The data suggest that PDCoV has a low seroprevalence in pig population in Hebei province, China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f91","authors":["Luo, Shang-xing","Fan, Jing-Hui","Opriessnig, Tanja","Di, Jing-Mei","Liu, Bao-jing","Zuo, Yu-Zhu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jviromet.2017.08.020","first_seen_on":"2017-09-02T10:20:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0166-0934","1879-0984"],"journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1504347604,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28860101?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28860101","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Development and application of a recombinant M protein-based indirect ELISA for the detection of porcine deltacoronavirus IgG antibodies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-application-recombinant-m-proteinbased-indirect-elisa-detection-porcine-deltacoronavirus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4522983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2357412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173974,"mean":12.355325194139,"rank":95007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":61432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173974,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":770,"mean":2.0385123537061,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":770,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.947619047619,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RoslinPapers\/statuses\/903925485800898561","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24664211],"posted_on":"2017-09-02T10:20:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Roslin Publications","url":"http:\/\/www.roslin.ed.ac.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507509357982937089\/91x5T5oi_normal.jpeg","description":"Publications from The Roslin Institute","id_on_source":"RoslinPapers","tweeter_id":"2789363478","geo":{"lt":55.95206,"ln":-3.19648,"country":"GB"},"followers":89},"tweet_id":"903925485800898561"}]}}
