Since mutations in the gene encoding Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) underlie the neuropathology of some forms of familial ALS, we explored how expression of mutant SOD1 protein A4V SOD1-EGFP affected the biology of secondary murine astrocytes. A4V SOD1-EGFP expressing astrocytes (72\u00a0h after transfection) displayed decreased mitochondrial activity (~45%) and L-glutamate transport (~25%), relative to cells expressing wild-type SOD1-EGFP. A4V SOD1-EGFP altered F-actin and Hoechst staining, indicative of cytoskeletal and nuclear changes, and altered GM130 labelling suggesting fragmentation of Golgi apparatus. SOD1 inclusion formation shifted from discrete to \"punctate\" over 72\u00a0h with A4V SOD1-EGFP more rapidly producing inclusions than G85R SOD1-EGFP, and forming more punctate aggregates. A4V, not wild-type SOD1-EGFP, exerted a substantial, time-dependent effect on GFAP expression, and ~60% of astrocytes became stellate and hypertrophic at 72\u00a0h. Spreading toxicity was inferred since at 72\u00a0h ~80% of bystander cells exhibited hypertrophy and stellation. This evidence favours mutant SOD1-containing astrocytes releasing destructive species that alter the biology of adjacent astrocytes. This panoply of mutant SOD1-induced destructive events favours recruitment of astrocytes to non-cell autonomous injury in ALS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003191","authors":["Nicole Wallis","Chew L.
