Holding down the response lever for the requisite amount of time resulted in the delivery of sweetened condensed milk. Response durations shorter than those required for reinforcer delivery did not result in any programmed consequences, nor were cumulative durations across multiple presses applied towards the duration requirements. The number of reinforcer deliveries decreased as a function of reinforcer requirements. Reinforcer delays alone also decreased consumption, but to a lesser extent than increasing duration requirements. Results are congruent with previous research demonstrating that parameters of reinforcement schedules may have similar effects on both continuous and discrete dimensions of operant behavior. Hursh and Silberberg's (2008) exponential demand equation provided a good fit for several of the data sets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023af","authors":["Sara Peck","Tom Byrne"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.beproc.2016.04.002","first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T16:55:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03766357","1872-8308"],"journal":"Behavioural Processes","last_mentioned_on":1460220907,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0376635716300808&_version=1&md5=f6c814a12d5b2f6cf6dc6517e74c7960"],"pmid":"27063407","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Demand in Rats Responding Under Duration-Based Schedules of Reinforcement","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/demand-rats-responding-under-durationbased-schedules-reinforcement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517098,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271527,"mean":11.249831979258,"rank":229486,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271527,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":885,"mean":8.9619660633484,"rank":782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":885,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":3.9265581395349,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BehavEcolPapers\/statuses\/718844705748824065","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6580533],"posted_on":"2016-04-09T16:55:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Behav Ecol Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/517345050670268416\/beckzx8T_normal.jpeg","description":"Papers in behavioral ecology #ethology animal #behavior from #PubMed & journal feeds @ASNAmNAT @PLOSBiology @LinneanSociety - literature bot by @MihalyFoldvari","id_on_source":"BehavEcolPapers","tweeter_id":"2797948887","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1166},"tweet_id":"718844705748824065"}]}}
