The subjects were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPS group, LPS+PBS group, and LPS+Treg group. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to evaluate HO-1, LIF mRNA, and protein levels in the placenta. ELISA was used to detect these parameters in the peripheral blood of pregnant mice.\nThe expression of HO-1 and LIF in the placenta of the LPS group was significantly decreased when compared to that of the control group (p<0.05). Serum HO-1 and LIF levels were higher than in the control group (p<0.05). In the Treg cell-treated group placental tissue HO-1 and LIF expression were significantly higher than in the LPS group (p<0.05), and serum HO-1 and LIF expression were significantly lower than in the LPS group (p<0.05).\nHO-1 and LIF participate with Treg cells in the maternal-fetal interface, producing a unique immune microenvironment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa2","authors":["Wang, Fan","Xiao, Mi","Lin, Xiao-Jie","Muhammad, Siddiq","Piao, Xian-Hua","Liu, Li"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T23:32:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0024-7758"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Reproductive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1460244747,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26995887"],"pmid":"26995887","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Expression of Heme Oxygenase-1 and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor in Maternal Plasma and Placental Tissue in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Late Pregnancy Preterm Birth Mouse Model.","type":"article","volume":"61"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271528,"mean":11.249757954089,"rank":229488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271528,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241,"mean":3.7592083333333,"rank":189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.69444444444444,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Loose_Lab_Rat\/statuses\/718944697943736320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6588477],"posted_on":"2016-04-09T23:32:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Kelly A.
