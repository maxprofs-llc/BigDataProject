This was done to test the hypotheses that the shape of an endothelial cell is related to the local wall shear stress associated with the flowing blood and that alterations in hemodynamics, produced by vascular geometrical changes, influence endothelial cell geometry. Aortic stenosis with a reduction of 71% of the cross-sectional area was produced. The animals were sacrificed 12 weeks later, and the endothelial cell geometry and orientation were studied using the vascular casting technique and a computerized analysis to determine cell area and shape index. The regions of the stenosis examined were those known to experience different hemodynamic conditions. The value of the shape index was found to fall rapidly in the convergent region of the stenosis and to increase suddenly in the divergent region, eventually returning to the prestenotic value at a more distal site. Using a model of a stenosis made from a vascular cast, laser Doppler anemometry was applied to measure velocity profiles and to estimate the local wall shear stress in a stenosed aorta. It is shown that the shape index distribution along these stenosed vessels may be correlated with the level of wall shear stress, with more elongated cells occurring in regions of higher shear stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d9c2","authors":["Levesque, M J","Liepsch, D","Moravec, S","Nerem, R M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-09T21:40:35+00:00","issns":["0276-5047"],"issue":"2","journal":"Arteriosclerosis an official journal of the American Heart Association Inc","last_mentioned_on":1460238016,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3954676"],"pmid":"3954676","pubdate":"1986-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Correlation of endothelial cell shape and wall shear stress in a stenosed dog aorta.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-endothelial-cell-shape-wall-shear-stress-stenosed-dog-aorta"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":5695244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1006450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271528,"mean":11.249769555145,"rank":190799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42040,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271528,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":23.1666,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
