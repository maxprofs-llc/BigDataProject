Our thesis will be that the cartilage autograft is the implant of choice in many of these areas, and that fate of autogenous cartilage is well known and should be given strong priority in facial grafting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005aee","authors":["M E Tardy","J Denneny","M H Fritsch"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T03:53:33+00:00","issns":["0023-852X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Laryngoscope","last_mentioned_on":1289130726,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3990484"],"pmid":"3990484","pubdate":"1985-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"The versatile cartilage autograft in reconstruction of the nose and face.","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/versatile-cartilage-autograft-reconstruction-nose-face"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9343443616567,"rank":816577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96511,"mean":7.5017723344732,"rank":24526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70903,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96511,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1617,"mean":2.2976868811881,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":1177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1617,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.3007575757576,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
