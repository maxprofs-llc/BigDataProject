The output is a colour, or black-and-white, PostScript file giving a simple and informative representation of the intermolecular interactions and their strengths, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and atom accessibilities. The program is completely general for any ligand and can also be used to show other types of interaction in proteins and nucleic acids. It was designed to facilitate the rapid inspection of many enzyme complexes, but has found many other applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa82a3cf058f61000be2b","authors":["Andrew C.
