It can be used for fields of study including metabolomics, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, biomarker discovery, medicine, nutrition, and general education. In addition to its comprehensive literature-derived data, the HMDB contains an extensive collection of experimental metabolite concentration data for plasma, urine, CSF, and\/or other biofluids The HMDB is fully searchable, with many tools for viewing, sorting and extracting metabolite names, chemical structures, biofluid concentrations, enzymes, genes, NMR or MS spectra, and disease information. Each metabolite entry in the HMDB contains an average of 90 separate data fields including a comprehensive compound description, names and synonyms, chemical structure information, physico-chemical data, reference NMR and MS spectra, normal and abnormal biofluid concentrations, tissue locations, disease associations, pathway information, enzyme data, gene sequence data, and SNP and mutation data, as well as extensive links to images, references and other public databases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000dbe5","authors":["Forsythe, Ian J.","Wishart, David S."],"doi":"10.1002\/0471250953.bi1408s25","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T01:34:18+00:00","issns":["1934-340X"],"journal":"Current protocols in bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1326777846,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/0471250953.bi1408s25","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19274632"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/0471250953.bi1408s25\/pdf","pmid":"19274632","pubdate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","computationalbiology"],"title":"Exploring human metabolites using the human metabolome database.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exploring-human-metabolites-using-human-metabolome-database"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627884,"mean":4.9451200333677,"rank":817400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627884,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97297,"mean":8.1123481335308,"rank":25204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97297,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":2.7863461538462,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":5.5986666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
