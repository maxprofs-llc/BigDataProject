The purpose of this study was to investigate the structural activity, and the anti-inflammatory functions and mechanism(s) of ethyl caffeate. Ethyl caffeate was found to markedly suppress the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production (IC(50) = 5.5 microg ml(-1)), mRNA and protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Transient gene expression assays using human cox-2 promoter construct revealed that ethyl caffeate exerted an inhibitory effect on cox-2 transcriptional activity in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated MCF-7 cells. Immunohistochemical studies of mouse skin demonstrated that TPA-induced COX-2 expression was significantly inhibited by ethyl caffeate with a superior effect to that of celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor kappaB (IkappaB) and the translocation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) into the nucleus, as well as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) induced by LPS in macrophages, were not affected by ethyl caffeate. Ethyl caffeate, however, could inhibit NF-kappaB activation by impairing the binding of NF-kappaB to its cis-acting element. These results suggest that ethyl caffeate suppresses iNOS and COX-2 expressions partly through the inhibition of the NF-kappaB.DNA complex formation. Structure-activity relationship analyses suggested that the catechol moiety and alpha,beta-unsaturated ester group in ethyl caffeate are important and essential structural features for preventing NF-kappaB.DNA complex formation. This study provides an insight into the probable mechanism(s) underlying the anti-inflammatory and therapeutic properties of ethyl caffeate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Chiang, Yi\u2010Ming","Lo, Chiu\u2010Ping","Chen, Yi\u2010Ping","Wang, Sheng\u2010Yang","Yang, Ning\u2010Sun","Kuo, Yueh\u2010Hsiung","Shyur, Lie\u2010Fen"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.bjp.0706343","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T03:29:45+00:00","issns":["1476-5381"],"journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1339727034,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.bjp.0706343","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16041399","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1576288"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1038\/sj.bjp.0706343\/pdf","pmid":"16041399","pubdate":"2009-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Ethyl caffeate suppresses NF-\u03baB activation and its downstream inflammatory mediators, iNOS, COX-2, and PGE2 in vitro or in mouse skin","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ethyl-caffeate-suppresses-nfkappab-activation-downstream-inflammatory-mediators-inos-cox2-pge2-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3989098,"mean":5.0355800489838,"rank":917215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528315,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3989098,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133030,"mean":9.0945137040882,"rank":40498,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":90737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133030,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1826,"mean":3.5287280701754,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1826,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":4.2670434782609,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
