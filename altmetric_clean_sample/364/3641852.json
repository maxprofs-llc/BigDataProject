Sequencing, mass spectrometric analysis, and comparison of its chromatographic behavior with that of the synthetic peptide confirmed the structure. Like Tyr-MIF-1, which was previously isolated from human brain tissue, Tyr-W-MIF-1 can inhibit the binding of 3H-DAMGO (selective for mu opiate receptors) to rat brain and can act as an opiate agonist as well as antagonist. Tyr-W-MIF-1 was a more potent opiate agonist than Tyr-MIF-1, the free acid of Tyr-W-MIF-1, and the structurally related hemoglobin-derived opiate peptide hemorphin-4 (Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr) in the guinea pig ileum. Each of these peptides acted as opiate antagonists on the ileum from morphine-tolerant guinea pigs; the free acid of Tyr-W-MIF-1 was the most potent antagonist in inhibiting the activity of DAMGO. The results demonstrate the presence in human brain of a new member of the Tyr-MIF-1 family of biologically active peptides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032be","authors":["J Erchegyi","A J Kastin","J E Zadina"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T00:38:30+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0196-9781"],"issue":"4","journal":"Peptides","last_mentioned_on":1322243370,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1359507"],"pmid":"1359507","pubdate":"1992-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Isolation of a novel tetrapeptide with opiate and antiopiate activity from human brain cortex: Tyr-Pro-Trp-Gly-NH2 (Tyr-W-MIF-1).","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-novel-tetrapeptide-opiate-antiopiate-activity-human-brain-cortex-tyrprotrpglynh2-tyrwmif1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":816179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98010,"mean":8.1783110530668,"rank":25524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98010,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":2.2874015444015,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.7625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Hemorphin-4","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=462435423#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3641851,3641852],"posted_on":"2011-11-25T17:49:30+00:00","summary":"Hemorphin-4 is an endogenous opioid peptide of the hemorphin family which possesses antinociceptive properties and is derived from the \u03b2-chain of hemoglobin in the bloodstream.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=33863877","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Vanished 45kd09la13","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Vanished 45kd09la13"}}]}}
