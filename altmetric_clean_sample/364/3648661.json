This method allows a wide range of functional group tolerant trifluoromethylated arenes and alkenes to be easily prepared. This oxidative trifluoromethylation has the potential to introduce trifluoromethyl groups into advanced, highly functionalized organic molecules.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Lingling Chu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol1023135","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T04:16:55+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1414769712,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ol1023135","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20923196"],"pmid":"20923196","pubdate":"2010-05-10T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Copper-mediated oxidative trifluoromethylation of boronic acids.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coppermediated-oxidative-trifluoromethylation-boronic-acids"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4451338,"mean":4.7949337261779,"rank":983531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":2895836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4451338,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157382,"mean":7.6046427332398,"rank":42261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":113225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157382,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2844,"mean":3.2281582835033,"rank":824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2844,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.8644155844156,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
