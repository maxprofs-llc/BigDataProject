We present the structure of gastric H(+),K(+)-ATPase at 6.5 A resolution as determined by electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals. The structure shows the catalytic alpha-subunit and the non-catalytic beta-subunit in a pseudo-E(2)P conformation. Different from Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, the N-terminal tail of the beta-subunit is in direct contact with the phosphorylation domain of the alpha-subunit. This interaction may hold the phosphorylation domain in place, thus stabilizing the enzyme conformation and preventing the reverse reaction of the transport cycle. Indeed, truncation of the beta-subunit N-terminus allowed the reverse reaction to occur. These results suggest that the beta-subunit N-terminus prevents the reverse reaction from E(2)P to E(1)P, which is likely to be relevant for the generation of a large H(+) gradient in vivo situation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Kazuhiro Abe","Kazutoshi Tani","Tomohiro Nishizawa","Yoshinori Fujiyoshi"],"doi":"10.1038\/emboj.2009.102","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T03:59:50+00:00","issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1425979666,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/emboj.2009.102","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19387495","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2693145"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/hw-f5-embojnl.highwire.org\/content\/embojnl\/28\/11\/1637.full.pdf","pmid":"19387495","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Inter-subunit interaction of gastric H+,K+-ATPase prevents reverse reaction of the transport cycle","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intersubunit-interaction-gastric-hkatpase-prevents-reverse-reaction-transport-cycle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4855454,"mean":5.7883919127654,"rank":1184374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3079235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4855454,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184197,"mean":8.6853121566161,"rank":54579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":127189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184197,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3912,"mean":4.171856814114,"rank":807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3912,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":16.315094339623,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
