The following results were obtained: A single administration of Y-8894 (2.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) to experimentally induced amnesic rats significantly antagonized the decrease in the mean number of PCA responses induced by an electroconvulsive shock (ECS). At a higher dose (10 mg\/kg, i.p.), however, this effect was reduced. Repeated administration of Y-8894 (5 mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly antagonized the facilitation of the extinction of the PCA response induced by exposure to CO2. Repeated administration of Y-8894 (2.5 mg\/kg, i.p.) significantly facilitated the learning of the PCA response in intact rats. At a higher dose (5 mg\/kg, i.p.), however, this effect was reduced. A single administration of Y-8894 (5 mg\/kg, i.p. and 25 mg\/kg, p.o.) significantly delayed the extinction of the PCA response in intact rats. These results suggest that Y-8894 has an ameliorative and facilitative effect on learning and memory in experimentally induced amnesic and intact rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6183cf058f610007458","authors":["K Anami","Y Yamamoto","M Setoguchi","Y Maruyama"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T00:03:36+00:00","issns":["0015-5691"],"issue":"3","journal":"Folia Pharmacologica Japonica","last_mentioned_on":1319735092,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2884174"],"pmid":"2884174","pubdate":"1987-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"[Pharmacological studies on Y-8894.
