The reason for this ectopic placement is the apparent inability of nigral grafts placed in the ventral mesencephalon (VM) of the adult host to grow axons for long distances that are capable of reaching the ipsilateral striatum and thus restoring the nigrostriatal pathway. The present study demonstrates for the first time that simultaneous dopaminergic transplants (double grafts) placed in the substantia nigra and ipsilateral striatum of rats bearing unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions reconstruct the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in the adult rat brain. Numerous tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive axons were observed arising from the intranigral graft and growing rostrally along the internal capsule and medial forebrain bundle to reinnervate the ipsilateral striatum, which also had received a dopaminergic graft. These double grafts achieved not only greater striatal reinnervation than the standard intrastriatal graft but also a faster and more complete rotational recovery to amphetamine challenge 6 weeks after transplantation. These results suggest strongly that embryonic nigral transplants implanted in the striatum are capable of promoting growth and providing guidance to axons arising from a dopaminergic graft placed homotopically in the VM, resulting in restoration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal projection. Reconstruction of the nigrostriatal pathway by double grafts may not only achieve substantial striatal reinnervation but may also contribute to the reestablishment of dopaminergic regulation of the nigrostriatal circuitry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Ivar Mendez","Damaso Sadi","Murray Hong"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T02:26:39+00:00","issns":["1529-2401","0270-6474"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1408136647,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/16\/22\/7216.long","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8929430"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/16\/22\/7216.full.pdf","pmid":"8929430","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Reconstruction of the nigrostriatal pathway by simultaneous intrastriatal and intranigral dopaminergic transplants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reconstruction-nigrostriatal-pathway-simultaneous-intrastriatal-intranigral-dopaminergic-transplants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143352,"mean":5.1107237333896,"rank":965291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2615341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143352,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140958,"mean":9.0884706825488,"rank":43616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":95368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140958,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9833,"mean":6.4961519528072,"rank":2959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":5787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9833,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":13.110659898477,"rank":157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
