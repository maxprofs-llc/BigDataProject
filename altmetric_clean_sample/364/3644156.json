These are depression occurring during pregnancy; childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder; disorders of parent-to-infant attachment and perinatal bereavement. It is suggested that, if these could be better addressed in the forthcoming DSM V, this would provide a very significant impetus for improved education of health professionals, as well as better recognition and earlier intervention in these disorders. As these are relatively common disorders, a very large number of women and their families would potentially benefit.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002310","authors":["John Condon","Condon J"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00737-009-0114-1","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T01:50:21+00:00","issns":["1435-1102","1434-1816"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Women's Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1327783654,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00737-009-0114-1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20127444"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00737-009-0114-1.pdf","pmid":"20127444","pubdate":"2010-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Vienna","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychotherapy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Women's mental health: a \"wish-list\" for the DSM V.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/womens-mental-health-wishlist-dsm-v"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631524,"mean":4.926174121992,"rank":816067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631524,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98168,"mean":8.1808324793466,"rank":25588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98168,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176,"mean":2.2033828571429,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.4076923076923,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
