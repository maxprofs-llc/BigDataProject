A one-dimensional acoustic metamaterial with an array of side holes on a tube was fabricated. We observed that acoustic waves above 450\u00a0Hz propagated well in this structure, but no sound below 450\u00a0Hz passed through. The frequency characteristics of the metamaterial has the same form as that of the permittivity in metals due to the plasma oscillation. We also provide a theory to explain the experimental results.","ads_id":"2009JPCM...21q5704L","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df0","arxiv_id":"0812.2952","authors":["Sam Hyeon Lee","Choon Mahn Park","Yong Mun Seo","Zhi Guo Wang","Chul Koo Kim"],"doi":"10.1088\/0953-8984\/21\/17\/175704","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T04:06:09+00:00","issns":["0953-8984","1361-648X"],"issue":"17","journal":"Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter","last_mentioned_on":1358881930,"links":["http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/0812.2952","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1088\/0953-8984\/21\/17\/175704"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/0812.2952v2","pmid":"21825432","pubdate":"2009-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"175704","subjects":["biophysics","nanotechnology"],"title":"Acoustic metamaterial with negative modulus.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tunable-acoustic-metamaterial-negative-modulus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":815889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98691,"mean":8.2216722261629,"rank":25814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98691,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222599,"mean":2.7533355286212,"rank":29579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":179849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222599,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
