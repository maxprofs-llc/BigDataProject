In 1760, he served briefly on a whaling ship and then entered the Royal Navy. He subsequently had many postings, several of them to the tropics. He recorded his observations on fevers, scurvy and other illnesses. After 23 years of active service, he retired to private practice in Hampshire. However, later he rejoined the service and was appointed physician to the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, where later he was made a Director. During this period, he addressed the problems of illness after the days of active service. Robertson was thus an early practitioner in the care of the elderly. He retired in 1807 and died at Greenwich at the age of 87.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cf7","authors":["Cook G"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T04:12:04+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Medical Biography","last_mentioned_on":1337067574,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16435033"],"pmid":"16435033","pubdate":"2006-01-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Historical Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Robert Robertson, FRS (1742-1829): physician to the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, 18th-century authority on 'fever', and early practitioner in care of the elderly.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/robert-robertson-frs-17421829-physician-royal-hospital-greenwich-18thcentury-authority-fever-early-p"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":817662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286423,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97166,"mean":8.0875416868215,"rank":25150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97166,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":3.2381298701299,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Robert Robertson (physician)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=492657242#altmetric_citation_0","license":"public","citation_ids":[3648531],"posted_on":"2012-05-15T07:39:34+00:00","summary":"Robert Robertson (1742\u20131829) was a British surgeon and a Fellow of the Royal Society.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=35825848","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Materialscientist","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Materialscientist"}}]}}
