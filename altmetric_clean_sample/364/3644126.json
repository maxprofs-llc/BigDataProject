Mutations in both proteins have been reported to alter or abolish circadian rhythmicity. Here, we present molecular models of both KaiA and KaiB from the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp PCC7120 deduced by crystal structure analysis, and we discuss how clock-changing or abolishing mutations may cause their resulting circadian phenotype. The overall fold of the KaiA monomer is that of a four-helix bundle. KaiB, on the other hand, adopts an alpha-beta meander motif. Both proteins purify and crystallize as dimers. While the folds of the two proteins are clearly different, their size and some surface features of the physiologically relevant dimers are very similar. Notably, the functionally relevant residues Arg 69 of KaiA and Arg 23 of KaiB align well in space. The apparent structural similarities suggest that KaiA and KaiB may compete for a potential common binding site on KaiC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Robert G Garces","Ning Wu","Wanda Gillon","Emil F Pai"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.emboj.7600190","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T01:49:15+00:00","issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1327396569,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/sj.emboj.7600190","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15071498","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC394244"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/embojnl\/23\/8\/1688.full.pdf","pmid":"15071498","publisher":"EMBO Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Anabaena circadian clock proteins KaiA and KaiB reveal a potential common binding site to their partner KaiC","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anabaena-circadian-clock-proteins-kaia-kaib-reveal-potential-common-binding-site-partner-kaic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":817353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97321,"mean":8.115848212084,"rank":25211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97321,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.1987823911956,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1729,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":7.16875,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
