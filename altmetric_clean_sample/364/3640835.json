The two communities were enriched in Accumulibacter clade IA and clade IIA, respectively. By performing a series of batch experiments, we found that clade IA was able to couple nitrate reduction with phosphorus uptake, but clade IIA could not. These results agree with a previously proposed hypothesis that different populations of Accumulibacter have different nitrate reduction capabilities, and they will help to understand the ecological roles that these two clades provide.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c1d","authors":["Flowers, Jason J.","He, Shaomei","Yilmaz, Safak","Noguera, Daniel R.","McMahon, Katherine D."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2009.00090.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T00:08:11+00:00","issns":["1758-2229"],"journal":"Environmental Microbiology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1320156870,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2009.00090.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20808723","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2929836"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1758-2229.2009.00090.x\/pdf","pmid":"20808723","pubdate":"2009-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Denitrification capabilities of two biological phosphorus removal sludges dominated by different \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d clades","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/denitrification-capabilities-two-biological-phosphorus-removal-sludges-dominated-different-candidatu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":817789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97045,"mean":8.0723666790323,"rank":25089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":70870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97045,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245,"mean":2.4403442622951,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.8246666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
