The three most useful diagnostic modalities for detecting AEF are abdominal computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and arteriography. The treatment of AEFs has improved in recent years, but despite the multiple surgical techniques reported, many of the patients do not survive or are left debilitated after treatment. Endovascular repair is an efficient and safe method to stabilize patients with life-threatening AEFs. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive and synthetic review of the latest advantages on the diagnosis and management of primary and secondary AEF.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90d3cf058f61000cb48","authors":["Xiromeritis K","Dalainas I","Stamatakos M","Filis K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T03:39:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"International surgery","last_mentioned_on":1334976892,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22216707"],"pmid":"22216707","pubdate":"2012-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Aortoenteric fistulae: present-day management.","type":"article","volume":"96","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aortoenteric-fistulae-presentday-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816003,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98253,"mean":8.1902457151002,"rank":25636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":71522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98253,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":2.0126394052045,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.8925,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
