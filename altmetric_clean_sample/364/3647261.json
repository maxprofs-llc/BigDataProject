Studies of GPCRs have long been performed under the assumption that GPCRs function as monomers. However, recent studies have revealed that many GPCRs function as homo- and\/or hetero-dimers or higher-order oligomeric molecular complexes. As a result, information about GPCR oligomerization is rapidly accumulating, although the molecular mechanisms of oligomerization are not fully understood. A comprehensive collection of information about oligomerization would accelerate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of GPCRs' oligomerization and involvement in signaling. Hence, we have developed a database, G protein coupled Receptor Interaction Partners DataBase (GRIPDB), which provides information about GPCR oligomerization. The entries in the database are divided into two sections: (I) Experiment Information section and (II) Prediction Information section. The Experiment Information section contains (I-i) experimentally indentified GPCR oligomers and their annotations, and (I-ii) experimentally suggested interfaces for the oligomerization. Since the number of experimentally suggested interfaces is limited, the entries in the Prediction Information section have been introduced to provide information about the oligomerization interfaces predicted by our computational method. The experimentally suggested or computationally predicted interfaces are displayed by 3D graphics, using GPCRs with available coordinates. The information in the GRIPDB, especially that about the interfaces, is useful to investigate the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction via GPCR oligomerization.
