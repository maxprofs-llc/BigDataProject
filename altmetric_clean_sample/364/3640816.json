Bush in January 2002 and is regarded as the most significant federal education policy initiative in a generation. The primary focus of the No Child Left Behind Act is on promoting educational success for all children; however, the legislation also contains opportunities to advance school-based mental health. Unfortunately, the complexities of the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act have made it difficult for educators, stakeholders, and mental health professionals to understand the legal and practical interface between No Child Left Behind and the school mental health movement. Therefore, the goals of this article are to (1) raise awareness about the challenges educators and school mental health professionals face as a result of the implementation of No Child Left Behind and (2) provide ideas and recommendations to advance the interface between No Child Left Behind and school mental health, which will support key provisions of the act and the growth of the field.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f10","authors":["Daly, Brian P.","Burke, Robert","Hare, Isadora","Mills, Carrie","Owens, Celeste","Moore, Elizabeth","Weist, Mark D."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1746-1561.2006.00142.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-15T00:07:30+00:00","issns":["1746-1561"],"journal":"Journal of School Health","last_mentioned_on":1400080840,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1746-1561.2006.00142.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1746-1561.2006.00142.x\/pdf","pmid":"17026637","pubdate":"2006-10-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","healthservices"],"title":"Enhancing No Child Left Behind\u2013School Mental Health Connections","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhancing-child-left-behindschool-mental-health-connections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3746575,"mean":4.9833394322422,"rank":852449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2369985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3746575,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117197,"mean":8.8879588552511,"rank":34339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":81554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117197,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":4.5729823529412,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.9944444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
