After aceperone, animals were found to be severely and consistently impaired at learning the first task of each test session and to be impaired on new and repeated reversal learning. They were, however, unimpaired on learning another similar task in each test session and on performance of a well-learnt task. Results were interpreted as evidence for defective association formation which can be compensated for by suitable priming or practice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["R.M.
