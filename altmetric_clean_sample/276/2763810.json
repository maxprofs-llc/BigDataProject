Wallstent\u2122 has been the commonest stent type used in reported experience. It has excellent long-term patency with good clinical outcome, but is prone to compression\/migration of the upper end of the stent requiring reinterventions. Extension of the stent into the vena cava to avoid this problem may render subsequent contralateral stenting technically difficult and possibly contribute to partial jailing of contralateral flow. A technical modification in which a Gianturco Z stent\u2122 is added to the upper end of the Wallstent stack that may ameliorate some of these concerns is described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a37","authors":["Seshadri Raju","Mark Ward","Orla Kirk"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.avsg.2014.02.026","first_seen_on":"2014-10-11T09:54:03+00:00","issns":["0890-5096","08905096"],"issue":"6","journal":"Annals of Vascular Surgery (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1505055241,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.annalsofvascularsurgery.com%2Farticle%2FS0890-5096%252814%252900146-0%2Fabstract&code=avsg-site","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24632315"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annalsofvascularsurgery.com\/article\/S0890509614001460\/pdf","pmid":"24632315","pubdate":"2014-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1485","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"A Modification of Iliac Vein Stent Technique","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modification-iliac-vein-stent-technique"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392422,"mean":7.0682902969164,"rank":3647470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4624569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392422,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199585,"mean":7.9775834535837,"rank":70944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":125010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199585,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":647,"mean":1.3768297213622,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":498,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":647,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.79545454545455,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
