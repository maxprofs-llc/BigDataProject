We generated a plasmid expressing both an activated human H-ras gene and murine c-myc gene and showed that 1 \u00b5g of this plasmid, pMSV-T24-H-ras\/MSV-c-myc, was capable of inducing tumors in newborn NIH Swiss mice. However, to be able to detect the oncogenicity of dominant activated oncogenes in cellular DNA, a more sensitive system was needed. In this paper, we demonstrate that the newborn CD3 epsilon transgenic mouse, which is defective in both T-cell and NK-cell functions, can detect the oncogenic activity of 25 ng of the circular form of pMSV-T24-H-ras\/MSV-c-myc. When this plasmid was inoculated as linear DNA, amounts of DNA as low as 800 pg were capable of inducing tumors. Animals were found that had multiple tumors, and these tumors were independent and likely clonal. These results demonstrate that the newborn CD3 epsilon mouse is highly sensitive for the detection of oncogenic activity of DNA. To determine whether it can detect the oncogenic activity of cellular DNA derived from four human tumor-cell lines (HeLa, A549, HT-1080, and CEM), DNA (100 \u00b5g) was inoculated into newborn CD3 epsilon mice both in the presence of 1 \u00b5g of linear pMSV-T24-H-ras\/MSV-c-myc as positive control and in its absence. While tumors were induced in 100% of mice with the positive-control plasmid, no tumors were induced in mice receiving any of the tumor DNAs alone. These results demonstrate that detection of oncogenes in cellular DNA derived from four human tumor-derived cell lines in this mouse system was not possible; the results also show the importance of including a positive-control plasmid to detect inhibitory effects of the cellular DNA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Li Sheng-Fowler","Wei Tu","Haiqing Fu","Haruhiko Murata","Lynda Lanning","Gideon Foseh","Juliete Macauley","Donald Blair","Stephen H Hughes","John M Coffin","Andrew M Lewis","Keith Peden"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0108926","first_seen_on":"2014-10-11T10:15:41+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","phs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1413024453,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25302710?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25302710?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25302710","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Mouse Strain Defective in Both T Cells and NK Cells Has Enhanced Sensitivity to Tumor Induction by Plasmid DNA Expressing Both Activated H-Ras and c-Myc.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mouse-strain-defective-both-t-cells-nk-cells-enhanced-sensitivity-tumor-induction-plasmid-dna-expres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2317241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2592035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139806,"mean":8.6237492650479,"rank":59901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":75180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139806,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88902,"mean":9.2626057524664,"rank":41530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":43828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88902,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2706,"mean":15.352709057301,"rank":1472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2706,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NK_papers\/status\/520878133676101632","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2763941],"posted_on":"2014-10-11T10:06:39+00:00","author":{"name":"NK papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573591369375031296\/MLLMIFLv_normal.png","description":"Paper Twitterbot for academics with an interest in NK cell biology.","id_on_source":"NK_papers","tweeter_id":"2369366659","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":221},"tweet_id":"520878133676101632"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FoodAllergyNCBI\/status\/520878800649736192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2763941],"posted_on":"2014-10-11T10:09:18+00:00","author":{"name":"food_allergy_feed","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"FoodAllergyNCBI","tweeter_id":"1323728234","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":142},"tweet_id":"520878800649736192"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NKcellBiology\/status\/520888427684712448","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2763941],"posted_on":"2014-10-11T10:47:33+00:00","author":{"name":"NK cell Biology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/520597683086450689\/gybS02Uf_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #NKcell papers in #PubMed.
