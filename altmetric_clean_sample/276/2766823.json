Different components are recognized by distinct receptors, and thus it is speculated that these components may regulate different gene sets. To investigate the gene expression profiles regulated by different bacterial components in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, Japanese flounder were intraperitoneally injected with formalin-killed bacterial cells (FKC) of Edwardsiella tarda and Streptococcus iniae. The numbers of differentially regulated genes were much larger in the fish injected with E. tarda than those with S. iniae. Comprehensive gene expression profiling showed that almost all of the genes differentially regulated by injections of E. tarda FKC were also differentially regulated by injections of S. iniae FKC. mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, interferon \u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor were upregulated in both of the injected groups. Each of these mRNAs except for IL-8 mRNA were also much higher in the E. tarda FKC injected group than in the S. iniae FKC injected group. Furthermore, mRNA levels of IL-6 were strongly up-regulated in the E. tarda FKC injected group. The E. tarda FKC might induce higher inflammatory responses than S. iniae FKC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028d8","authors":["Hidehiro Kondo","Yuriko Kawana","Yoshiaki Suzuki","Ikuo Hirono"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsi.2014.09.038","first_seen_on":"2014-10-12T21:11:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-9947"],"journal":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1437105843,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25304547?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25304547","pubdate":"2014-10-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Comprehensive gene expression profiling in Japanese flounder kidney after injection with two different formalin-killed pathogenic bacteria.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comprehensive-gene-expression-profiling-japanese-flounder-kidney-after-injection-two-different-forma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5364494,"mean":6.2757404679269,"rank":3775798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":899520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5364494,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146425,"mean":8.6505632683168,"rank":98813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":29109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146425,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":868,"mean":0.91043367935409,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":403,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":868,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":0.425,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
