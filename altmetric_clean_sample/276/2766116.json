Harvesting of A. potatorum takes place before sexual reproduction and the over-extraction put local populations at high risk. In the community of San Luis Atolotil\u00e1n (SLA), mescal has been produced for one century but the growing mescal trade is leading to intensified agave extraction. Our study evaluated distribution and abundance of A. potatorum, extraction rates, management practices and economic importance for SLA households. The unbalanced relation between availability and extraction rates would be an indicator of risk requiring sustainable management strategies. Our case study aspires contributing to analyze general patterns for sustainable use for this and other forest products highly extracted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000084f","doi":"10.1186\/1746-4269-10-63","first_seen_on":"2014-10-12T13:07:16+00:00","issns":["1746-4269"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1431487926,"links":["http:\/\/www.ethnobiomed.com\/content\/10\/1\/63","http:\/\/www.ethnobiomed.com\/content\/10\/1\/63\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ethnobiomed.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4269-10-63.pdf","pmid":"25185769","pubdate":"2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"63","subjects":["medicine","socialsciences"],"title":"Distribution, abundance and traditional management of Agave potatorum in the Tehuac\u00e1n Valley, Mexico: bases for sustainable use of non-timber forest products","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/distribution-abundance-traditional-management-agave-potatorum-tehuac%C3%A1n-valley-mexico-bases-sustainab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5427320,"mean":6.318867553943,"rank":2694129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2569563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5427320,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147538,"mean":8.6427818513324,"rank":69247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":72217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147538,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":406,"mean":3.2656543209877,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":406,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.5607142857143,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
