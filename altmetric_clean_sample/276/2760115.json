This paper uses data from the third Botswana AIDS Impact Survey (BAIS III) to explore high-risk behaviors of adults and how they affect government efforts to stop the spread of HIV\/AIDS. The objective of this paper is to fill in the gap on the assessment of high-risk behaviors associated with HIV\/AIDS and their implications on HIV\/AIDS prevention efforts. A nationally representative sample of 10,159 men and women aged 20-64 years who had successfully completed the BAIS III individual questionnaire were used in the study. Both descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were used for analysis. Crude odds ratios were obtained from gross effects model while adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were obtained from the net effects model. Statistically significant association was observed between multiple current partners and alcohol consumption (AOR\u2009=\u20091.5), drug abuse (AOR\u2009=\u20091.7), transactional sex (AOR\u2009=\u20092.6) and intergenerational sex (AOR\u2009=\u20091.07). Furthermore, statistically significant association was seen for inconsistent condom use and having tested for HIV (AOR\u2009=\u20091.5). These results show a worrying tendency that despite government's efforts to stop the spread of HIV\/AIDS, adults in Botswana continue to indulge in high-risk behaviors. Therefore, any programs and policies on HIV\/AIDS should first target these high-risk behaviors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91e3cf058f61000d644","authors":["Mpho Keetile","Keetile M"],"doi":"10.1080\/17290376.2014.960948","endpage":"166","first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T15:13:19+00:00","issns":["1729-0376","1813-4424"],"issue":"1","journal":"SAHARA J journal of Social Aspects of HIV AIDS Research Alliance","last_mentioned_on":1414742839,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17290376.2014.960948","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17290376.2014.960948","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/17290376.2014.960948#.VDeg4I1waUk","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17290376.2014.960948#tabModule"],"pmid":"25293869","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"158","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","socialsciences"],"title":"High-risk behaviors among adult men and women in Botswana: Implications for HIV\/AIDS prevention efforts.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highrisk-behaviors-among-adult-men-women-botswana-implications-hivaids-prevention-efforts-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":986922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3511654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121337,"mean":8.3718625964268,"rank":33030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":87966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121337,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.255487804878,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
