CTL also contain CCL5 in cytoplasmic storage vesicles (CCL5V) distinct from CG, the role of which, in regulating T cell effector functions, is not understood. Using human CD8(+) T cells specific to a lung tumor-associated Ag, we show in this article that CTL release both secretory compartments into the immune synapse with autologous tumor cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that disorganization of the T cell microtubule cytoskeleton and defects in hMunc13-4 or Rab27a abrogate CG exocytosis and synaptic secretion of the chemokine. Mechanistically, synaptic release of CCL5 cytoplasmic storage vesicles likely occurs upon their coalescence with the Rab27a-hMunc13-4 compartment and results in autocrine, CCR5-dependent induction of CXCR4 cell surface expression, thereby promoting T cell migration in response to CXCL12. We propose that CCL5 polarized delivery represents a mechanism by which CTL control immune synapse duration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Katarzyna Franciszkiewicz","Marie Boutet","Ludiane Gauthier","Isabelle Vergnon","Kelly Peeters","Olivier Duc","Benjamin Besse","Genevi\u00e8ve de Saint Basile","Salem Chouaib","Fathia Mami-Chouaib"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1401184","first_seen_on":"2014-10-12T18:06:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1424912494,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25305322?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25305322","pubdate":"2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Synaptic Release of CCL5 Storage Vesicles Triggers CXCR4 Surface Expression Promoting CTL Migration in Response to CXCL12.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synaptic-release-ccl5-storage-vesicles-triggers-cxcr4-surface-expression-promoting-ctl-migration-res"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4809146,"mean":5.7500569465082,"rank":3406190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":783004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4809146,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131010,"mean":8.7043425871506,"rank":89388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131010,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5896,"mean":2.41908057676,"rank":4847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5896,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204,"mean":2.2011921182266,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
