The submandibular gland (SMG) provides approximately 70% of the unstimulated saliva that accounts for about 95% of the salivary flow during a 24-hour period. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) has been used in recent years to lower the RT dose to the parotid gland(s) to reduce long-term xerostomia. There is little experience with SMG-sparing IMRT. Mean RT doses to the SMG exceeding 39 Gy cause permanent ablation of both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow. Limited data suggest that SMG-sparing IMRT in selected patients results in reduced long-term xerostomia without increasing the risk of a local-regional recurrence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000696c","doi":"10.1097\/coc.0b013e318261054e","first_seen_on":"2014-10-13T12:51:10+00:00","issns":["0277-3732"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Oncology: Cancer Clinical Trials","last_mentioned_on":1413204593,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/amjclinicaloncology\/Abstract\/2014\/10000\/Submandibular_Gland_sparing_Intensity_modulated.16.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/amjclinicaloncology\/2014\/10000\/Submandibular_Gland_sparing_Intensity_modulated.16.pdf","pmid":"22892434","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"514","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Submandibular Gland-sparing Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/submandibular-glandsparing-intensitymodulated-radiotherapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3053855,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":934302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121063,"mean":8.2647703160366,"rank":77748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":30854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121063,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":757,"mean":1.1545132275132,"rank":301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":757,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":1.7695555555556,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AJCOonline\/status\/521643990211235842","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2769061],"posted_on":"2014-10-13T12:49:53+00:00","author":{"name":"AJCO","url":"http:\/\/amjclinicaloncology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1095553832\/AJCO_normal.jpg","description":"AJCO is a multidisciplinary journal for cancer surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, GYN oncologists, and pediatric oncologists.","id_on_source":"AJCOonline","tweeter_id":"174745137","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":75},"tweet_id":"521643990211235842"}]}}
