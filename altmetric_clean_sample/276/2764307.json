Type II endometrial carcinoma is often poorly differentiated and patients diagnosed with Type II disease (~11%) are disproportionately represented in annual endometrial cancer deaths (48%). Recent genomic studies highlight mutations in chromatin regulators as drivers in Type II endometrial carcinoma tumorigenesis, suggesting the use of epigenetic targeted therapies could provide clinical benefit to these patients. We investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of the LSD1 inhibitor HCI2509 in two poorly differentiated Type II endometrial cancer cell lines AN3CA and KLE.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b0","authors":["Emily R Theisen","Snehal Gajiwala","Jared Bearss","Venkataswamy Sorna","Sunil Sharma","Margit Janat-Amsbury","Theisen ER","Gajiwala S","Bearss J","Sorna V","Sharma S","Janat-Amsbury M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2407-14-752","first_seen_on":"2014-10-11T12:11:36+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1471-2407",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1416506126,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25300887?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2407\/14\/752"],"pmid":"25300887","pubdate":"2014-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Reversible inhibition of lysine specific demethylase 1 is a novel anti-tumor strategy for poorly differentiated endometrial carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversible-inhibition-lysine-specific-demethylase-1-novel-antitumor-strategy-poorly-differentiated-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4531279,"mean":5.2895690895932,"rank":2931009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1432541,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4531279,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121897,"mean":8.5626744109734,"rank":76783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":39973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121897,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2453,"mean":2.4524722675367,"rank":1283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2453,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":1.7781739130435,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
