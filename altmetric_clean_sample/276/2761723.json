Furthermore, the number of hospitalizations due to LRTIs has shown a sustained increase every year due to the lack of effective vaccines against hRSV. Thus, this virus remains as a major public health and economic burden worldwide. The lung pathology developed in hRSV-infected humans is characterized by an exacerbated inflammatory and Th2 immune response. In order to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus, several studies have focused in elucidating the interactions between hRSV virulence factors and the host immune system. Here, we discuss the main features of hRSV biology, the processes involved in virus recognition by the immune system and the most relevant mechanisms used by this pathogen to avoid the antiviral host response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc8b","authors":["Espinoza JA","Bohmwald K","C\u00e9spedes PF","Riedel CA","Bueno SM","Kalergis AM"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-10T20:56:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"7","journal":"Virulence","last_mentioned_on":1412764893,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25290906?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25290906","pubdate":"2014-10-08T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Modulation of host adaptive immunity by hRSV proteins.","type":"article","volume":"5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4344586,"mean":4.9066915936508,"rank":3407656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":126582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4344586,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117607,"mean":7.8155482033231,"rank":90852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":700,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117607,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":224,"mean":3.5264215246637,"rank":160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":224,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.425,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Immunol_papers\/status\/519790086133514240","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2761723],"posted_on":"2014-10-08T10:03:08+00:00","author":{"name":"ImmunologyPapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507527250015576065\/AHPc4B-C_normal.png","description":"A TwitterBot for #Immunology papers on #PubMed searching for adaptive, innate and cyto\/chemokine.
