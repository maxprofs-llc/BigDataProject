Surgeons often report that they feel more stressed when operating as a primary surgeon than in the function as an assistant which has been confirmed in recent studies. In this study, intra-individual workload was assessed in both intraoperative functions using a multidimensional approach that combined objective and subjective measures in a realistic work setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["Annika Rieger","Sebastian Fenger","Sebastian Neubert","Matthias Weippert","Steffi Kreuzfeld","Regina Stoll"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-014-3899-6","first_seen_on":"2014-10-11T09:46:06+00:00","issns":["1432-2218","0930-2794"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1413020752,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00464-014-3899-6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00464-014-3899-6.pdf","pmid":"25303917","pubdate":"2014-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Psychophysical workload in the operating room: primary surgeon versus assistant","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychophysical-workload-operating-room-primary-surgeon-versus-assistant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3037703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121524,"mean":8.3854442533516,"rank":79245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":28134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121524,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2176,"mean":1.6476294252874,"rank":1271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2176,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":1.7257012987013,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
