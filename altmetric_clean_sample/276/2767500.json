Catecholamines also signal \u03b1-adrenergic receptors, and greater \u03b1-adrenergic signaling has been shown to promote breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. However, antagonism of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors can result in elevated catecholamine levels, which may increase \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, because pre-synaptic \u03b12-adrenergic receptors mediate an autoinhibition of sympathetic transmission. Given these findings, we examined the effect of \u03b1-adrenergic blockade on breast cancer progression under non-stress and stress conditions (chronic restraint) in an orthotopic mouse model with MDA-MB-231HM cells. Chronic restraint increased primary tumor growth and metastasis to distant tissues as expected, and non-selective \u03b1-adrenergic blockade by phentolamine significantly inhibited those effects. However, under non-stress conditions, phentolamine increased primary tumor size and distant metastasis. Sympatho-neural gene expression for catecholamine biosynthesis enzymes was elevated by phentolamine under non-stress conditions, and the non-selective \u03b2-blocker propranolol inhibited the effect of phentolamine on breast cancer progression. Selective \u03b12-adrenergic blockade by efaroxan also increased primary tumor size and distant metastasis under non-stress conditions, but selective \u03b11-adrenergic blockade by prazosin did not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that \u03b12-adrenergic signaling can act through an autoreceptor mechanism to inhibit sympathetic catecholamine release and, thus, modulate established effects of \u03b2-adrenergic signaling on tumor progression-relevant biology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e6","authors":["Lamkin DM","Sung HY","Yang GS","David JM","Ma JC","Cole SW","Sloan EK"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psyneuen.2014.10.004","endpage":"270","first_seen_on":"2014-10-13T01:29:35+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["0306-4530","03064530"],"journal":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1413163773,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psyneuen-journal.com%2Farticle%2FS0306-4530%252814%252900386-2%2Fabstract&code=pnec-site","http:\/\/www.psyneuen-journal.com\/article\/S0306-4530(14)00386-2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.psyneuen-journal.com\/article\/S0306453014003862\/pdf","pmid":"25462899","pubdate":"2014-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"262","subjects":["endocrinology","psychiatry","neurology"],"title":"\u03b12-Adrenergic blockade mimics the enhancing effect of chronic stress on breast cancer progression","type":"article","volume":"51C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B12adrenergic-blockade-mimics-enhancing-effect-chronic-stress-breast-cancer-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4362153,"mean":4.8763204016409,"rank":2004444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2273234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4362153,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117694,"mean":7.7319817151403,"rank":49872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":64966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117694,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1234,"mean":5.5963698296837,"rank":567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1234,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":6.9955384615385,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
