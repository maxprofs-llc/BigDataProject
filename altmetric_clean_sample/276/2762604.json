CD44 is a major Wnt target gene in the intestine and is essential for Wnt-induced tumor progression in colorectal cancer. Here we show that CD44 acts as a positive regulator of the Wnt receptor complex. Downregulation of CD44 expression decreases, whereas CD44 overexpression increases Wnt activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Epistasis experiments place CD44 function at the level of the Wnt receptor LRP6. Mechanistically, CD44 physically associates with LRP6 upon Wnt treatment and modulates LRP6 membrane localization. Moreover, CD44 regulates Wnt signaling in the developing brain of Xenopus laevis embryos as shown by a decreased expression of Wnt targets tcf-4 and en-2 in CD44 morphants.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 10 October 2014; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2014.156.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["M Schmitt","M Metzger","D Gradl","G Davidson","V Orian-Rousseau"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2014.156","first_seen_on":"2014-10-11T00:29:46+00:00","issns":["1350-9047"," 1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1413224438,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cdd\/rss\/aop\/~3\/eNZEY7NYR0o\/cdd.2014.156","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/cdd\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/cdd2014156a.html"],"pmid":"25301071","pubdate":"2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Molecular biology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"CD44 functions in Wnt signaling by regulating LRP6 localization and activation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cd44-functions-wnt-signaling-regulating-lrp6-localization-activation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036026,"mean":5.9656490211997,"rank":481638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4533420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036026,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139856,"mean":8.6212859890603,"rank":18809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":120591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139856,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":873,"mean":5.0852385321101,"rank":123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":873,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":8.3805084745763,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
