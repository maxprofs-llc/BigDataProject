Who wins? pdf","This is probably the most stupid journal article title I have ever read."],"citation":{"abstract":"If people lose a sense organ, there is thought to be an increase in the remaining sensory functions. Previous studies showed ambiguous results on this topic. In a prospective matched pair case-control study on 46 blind and 46 normal-sighted subjects, the olfactory performance was examined using the Sniffin' Sticks Test [threshold-discrimination-identification (TDI) test], determining the olfactory threshold, the identification and the discrimination performance. There was no significant difference between the groups. Neither the overall olfactory performance (TDI score) nor any of its subtests did correlate with the vision or with the duration of blindness. The study could not detect any superior smell abilities of blind subjects as compared to sighted subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002814","authors":["Jan Christoffer Luers","Stefanie Mikolajczak","Moritz Hahn","Claus Wittekindt","Dirk Beutner","Karl-Bernd H\u00fcttenbrink","Michael Damm"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00405-013-2816-2","first_seen_on":"2013-11-17T19:45:26+00:00","issns":["1434-4726"],"journal":"European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology","last_mentioned_on":1422837592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24232912","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00405-013-2816-2"],"pmid":"24232912","pubdate":"2013-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Head and Neck Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Do the blinds smell better?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blinds-smell-better"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4704502,"mean":5.7146595011897,"rank":1852967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2822890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4704502,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117072,"mean":7.4177614780776,"rank":36823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":79322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117072,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1021,"mean":1.4705196078431,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":869,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1021,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.4130952380952,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
