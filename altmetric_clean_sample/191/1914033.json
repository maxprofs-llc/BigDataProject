Here, we provide evidence that type 4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) are critical regulators of the cAMP\/PKA-dependent activation of CFTR in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. In non-CF cells, PDE4 inhibition increased CFTR activity under basal conditions (\u0394ISC 7.1 \u03bcA\/cm(2)) and after isoproterenol stimulation (increased \u0394ISC from 13.9 to 21.0 \u03bcA\/cm(2)) and slowed the return of stimulated CFTR activity to basal levels by >3-fold. In cells homozygous for \u0394F508-CFTR, the most common mutation found in CF, PDE4 inhibition alone produced minimal channel activation. However, PDE4 inhibition strongly amplified the effects of CFTR correctors, drugs that increase expression and membrane localization of CFTR, and\/or CFTR potentiators, drugs that increase channel gating, to reach \u223c 25% of the chloride conductance observed in non-CF cells. Biochemical studies indicate that PDE4s are anchored to CFTR and mediate a local regulation of channel function. Taken together, our results implicate PDE4 as an important determinant of CFTR activity in airway epithelia, and support the use of PDE4 inhibitors to potentiate the therapeutic benefits of CFTR correctors and potentiators.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b3","authors":["Elise Blanchard","Lorna Zlock","Anna Lao","Delphine Mika","Wan Namkung","Moses Xie","Colleen Scheitrum","Dieter C.
