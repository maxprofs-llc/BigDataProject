Each intervention was offered for 14 weeks, plus three booster sessions. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were obtained prior to intervention, 7 and 14 weeks following the start of intervention, and 6 months following completion of intervention. CT, REBT, and fluoxetine did not differ significantly in changes in the BDI, depression-free days (DFDs), or Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Average BDI scores decreased from 31.1 before treatment to 9.7 six months following completion of treatment. Due to lower costs, both psychotherapies were more cost-effective, and had better cost-utility, than pharmacotherapy: median $26.44\/DFD gained\/month for CT and $23.77\/DFD gained\/month for REBT versus $34.93\/DFD gained\/month for pharmacotherapy, median $\/QALYs=$1,638, $1,734, and $2,287 for CT, REBT, and fluoxetine (Prozac), respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d07","authors":["Florin A Sava","Brian T Yates","Viorel Lupu","Aurora Szentagotai","Daniel David"],"doi":"10.1002\/jclp.20550","first_seen_on":"2013-11-19T18:36:52+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4679"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1384886696,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19051275"],"pmid":"19051275","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of cognitive therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, and fluoxetine (Prozac) in treating depression: a randomized clinical trial.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-costutility-cognitive-therapy-rational-emotive-behavioral-therapy-fluoxetine-proza"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616388,"mean":4.9295982487525,"rank":1808277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1632133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616388,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106738,"mean":7.0680021923046,"rank":46400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":54301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106738,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":3.6118467153285,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":8.4583333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
