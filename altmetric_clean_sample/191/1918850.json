Lung lacerations derived from fractures of the ribs are usually found in these patients. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is usually used as a routine procedure in the treatment of retained pleural collections. The objective of this study was to find out if there is any advantage in adding the procedure for repairing lacerated lungs during VATS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002823","authors":["Hsing-Lin Lin"],"doi":"10.1093\/ejcts\/ezt523","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T10:00:42+00:00","issns":["1873-734X"],"journal":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1404873082,"links":["http:\/\/ejcts.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/15\/ejcts.ezt523.full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ejcts.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/15\/ejcts.ezt523.full.pdf","pmid":"24242850","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"The role of repairing lung lacerations during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery evacuations for retained haemothorax caused by blunt chest trauma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-repairing-lung-lacerations-during-videoassisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-evacuations-retained-haem"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1586854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2900393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115679,"mean":7.1114071647161,"rank":32120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":82868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115679,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":705,"mean":1.6226278409091,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":705,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.74329411764706,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
