Collapse of the bubbles releases high energy and may cause damage to exposed surfaces. We recently designed a set-up to exploit the destructive nature of hydrodynamic cavitation for biomedical purposes. We have previously shown that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill leukemia cells and erode kidney stones. In this study, we analyzed the effects of cavitation on prostate cells and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue. We showed that hydrodynamic cavitation could kill prostate cells in a pressure- and time-dependent manner. Cavitation did not lead to programmed cell death, i.e. classical apoptosis or autophagy activation. Following the application of cavitation, we observed no prominent DNA damage and cells did not arrest in the cell cycle. Hence, we concluded that cavitation forces directly damaged the cells, leading to their pulverization. Upon application to BPH tissues from patients, cavitation could lead to a significant level of tissue destruction. Therefore similar to ultrasonic cavitation, we propose that hydrodynamic cavitation has the potential to be exploited and developed as an approach for the ablation of aberrant pathological tissues, including BPH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b7","authors":["Zeynep Itah","Ozlem Oral","Osman Yavuz Perk","Muhsincan Sesen","Ebru Demir","Secil Erbil","A Isin Dogan-Ekici","Sinan Ekici","Ali Kosar","Devrim Gozuacik"],"doi":"10.1177\/1535370213503273","endpage":"1250","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T17:30:21+00:00","issns":["1535-3699","1535-3702"],"issue":"11","journal":"Experimental Biology and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1384968612,"links":["http:\/\/ebm.sagepub.com\/content\/238\/11\/1242.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ebm.sagepub.com\/content\/238\/11\/1242.full.pdf","pmid":"24047796","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1242","subjects":["medicine","biology","physiology"],"title":"Hydrodynamic cavitation kills prostate cells and ablates benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue","type":"article","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrodynamic-cavitation-kills-prostate-cells-ablates-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-tissue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2015228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107569,"mean":7.0165924996284,"rank":53920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":30400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107569,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":3.1355504587156,"rank":211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":10.7,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
