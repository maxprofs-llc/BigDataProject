Nevertheless, most physicians are not familiar with the rare atypical often-confusing manifestations of thoracic sarcoid. Although these findings have been previously reviewed, but more recent advances in imaging and laboratory science, need to be incorporated. We present a review of literature and illustrate the review with unpublished data, intended to provide a more recent single comprehensive reference to assist with the diagnosis when atypical radiographic findings of thoracic sarcoidosis are encountered. Thoracic involvement accounts for most of morbidity and mortality associated with sarcoidosis. An accurate timely identification is required to minimize morbidity and mortality. It is essential to recognize atypical imaging findings and relate these to clinical manifestations and histology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f61000474d","authors":["Hamdan Al-Jahdali","Prabhakar Rajiah","Shyam Sunder Koteyar","Carolyn Allen","Ali Nawaz Khan"],"doi":"10.4103\/1817-1737.118490","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T13:27:06+00:00","issns":["1817-1737"],"issue":"4","journal":"Annals of Thoracic Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1416060353,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24250731?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.thoracicmedicine.org\/article.asp?issn=1817-1737%3Byear%3D2013%3Bvolume%3D8%3Bissue%3D4%3Bspage%3D186%3Bepage%3D196%3Baulast%3DAl-Jahdali#.VGZrY0axghE.facebook"],"pmid":"24250731","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Atypical radiological manifestations of thoracic sarcoidosis: A review and pictorial essay","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atypical-radiological-manifestations-thoracic-sarcoidosis-review-pictorial-essay"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2913971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1441941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115679,"mean":7.111418402808,"rank":71912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":40087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115679,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":3.018018018018,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
