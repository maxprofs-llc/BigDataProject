When the thin sections of islets from the NOD male mice, which received silica for the preservation of islets and subsequently cyclophosphamide, were examined under the electron microscope, clusters of endogenous retrovirus-like particles (type A) were frequently found in the beta-cells. In contrast, retrovirus-like particles were rarely found in the beta-cells from NOD male mice that received only silica. Other endocrine cells, including alpha-, delta-, pancreatic polypeptide-producing, and exocrine acinar cells, did not contain such viruslike particles. These viruslike particles were also not found in spleen, liver, or kidney in either cyclophosphamide-treated or untreated NOD male mice. There was a clear correlation between the presence of retrovirus-like particles in the beta-cells and insulitis lesions in the cyclophosphamide-treated mice. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the beta-cell-specific expression of endogenous retrovirus (like particles) is associated with the development of insulitis and diabetes in NOD mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Kenji Suenaga","Ji-Won Yoon"],"doi":"10.2337\/diab.37.12.1722","endpage":"1726","first_seen_on":"2013-11-19T16:41:54+00:00","issns":["1939-327X","0012-1797"],"issue":"12","journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1384803480,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/12\/1722.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/37\/12\/1722.full.pdf","pmid":"2847947","pubdate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Diabetes Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1722","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Association of \u03b2-Cell\u2013Specific Expression of Endogenous Retrovirus With Development of Insulitis and Diabetes in NOD Mouse","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-betacellspecific-expression-endogenous-retrovirus-development-insulitis-diabetes-nod-mou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":288207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3328965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107386,"mean":7.0263671462498,"rank":11145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":95993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107386,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2757,"mean":4.3908294629898,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2508,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2757,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":13.706666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Neanderthal virus DNA spotted hiding in modern humans","url":"http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/dn24598-neanderthal-virus-dna-spotted-hiding-in-modern-humans.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[108307,1917491,1917491,1916669],"posted_on":"2013-11-18T19:38:00+00:00","summary":"DNA of ancient viruses spotted in the Neanderthal genome has been identified in humans.
