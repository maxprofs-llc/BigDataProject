Estrogen transforms myometrium from a quiescent to a contractile status. Glucocorticoids have been shown to induce estrogen production through the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1)-mediated induction of aromatase transcription upon elevation of cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) level in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts. However, it is unclear how glucocorticoids activate cAMP pathway thereby inducing aromatase expression in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008eed","authors":["W S Wang","C Liu","W J Li","P Zhu","J N Li","K Sun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.placenta.2013.10.018","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T18:37:40+00:00","issns":["1532-3102"],"journal":"Placenta","last_mentioned_on":1384971393,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24239159"],"pmid":"24239159","pubdate":"2013-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"W.B.
