Most urinary diversions are constructed from intestinal segments. Urological surgeons who perform urinary diversion surgery should be aware of the physiological and metabolic changes that can occur when intestinal segments are in direct contact with urine. The complications associated with urinary diversion are both acute and chronic. The most important factor associated with the development of metabolic complications following urinary diversion is the length of time that the urine is in contact with the bowel and the type of bowel segment used for urinary diversion. In this review, we describe the metabolic complications associated with urinary diversion, their characteristic clinical presentation, follow-up, and specific treatment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000775f","authors":["Nikhil Vasdev","Andrew Moon","Andrew C Thorpe","Andrew C.
