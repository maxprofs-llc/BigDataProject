The SLAM web server integrates SLAM with repeat masking tools and the AVID alignment program to allow for rapid alignment and gene prediction in user submitted sequences. Along with annotations and alignments for the submitted sequences, users obtain a list of predicted conserved non-coding sequences (and their associated alignments). The web site also links to whole genome annotations of the human, mouse and rat genomes produced with the SLAM program.
