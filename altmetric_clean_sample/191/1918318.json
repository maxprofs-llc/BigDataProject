Seventeen phenolic constituents were measured by reverse phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Total phenolic compounds (TPCs), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) scavenging activities were performed to measure antioxidant capacity. Some kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax), and inhibition behaviors against five different substrates were measured in the crude extract. Catechin and chlorogenic acid were found as the major components in the methanolic extract, while ferulic acid, caffeic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, quercetin and p-coumaric acid were small quantities. Km values ranged from 0.70 to 10.10\u2009mM in the substrates, and also 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (HPPA) and L-DOPA showed the highest affinity. The inhibition constant of Ki were ranged from 0.05 to 14.90\u2009mM against sodium metabisulphite, ascorbic acid, sodium azide and benzoic acid, while ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulphite were the best inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fd5","authors":["Zehra Can","Barbaros Dincer","Huseyin Sahin","Nimet Baltas","Oktay Yildiz","Sevgi Kolayli"],"doi":"10.3109\/14756366.2013.858144","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T04:39:47+00:00","issns":["1475-6366","1475-6374"],"journal":"Journal of Enzyme Inhibition & Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1384922379,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14756366.2013.858144","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/14756366.2013.858144?ai=9iy&mi=3e34ke&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=ENZ&"],"pmid":"24246090","pubdate":"2013-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"Polyphenol oxidase activity and antioxidant properties of Yomra apple (Malus communis L.) from Turkey.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyphenol-oxidase-activity-antioxidant-properties-yomra-apple-imalus-communisi-l-turkey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635501,"mean":4.9219382456039,"rank":2901588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635501,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107744,"mean":7.0038306711343,"rank":83956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107744,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":422,"mean":0.48420427553444,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":422,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.625,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/403019786960924672","license":"public","citation_ids":[1918318],"posted_on":"2013-11-20T04:39:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"403019786960924672"}]}}
