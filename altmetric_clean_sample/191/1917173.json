This requires a high throughput screening and optimization of the microbial strains, which is nowadays commonly achieved by applying slow and labor-intensive submerged cultivation in shake flasks or microtiter plates. These methods are also limited towards end-point measurements, low analytical data output, and control over the fermentation process. These drawbacks could be overcome by means of scaled-down microfluidic microbioreactors (\u03bcBR) that allow for online control over cultivation data and automation, hence reducing cost and time. This review goes beyond previous work not only by providing a detailed update on the current \u03bcBR fabrication techniques but also the operation and control of \u03bcBRs is compared to large scale fermentation reactors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f6100039c3","authors":["Hanaa M.
