However, little is known about the exact role of different comorbid conditions in the development of postoperative complications. This question is especially interesting in the elderly population. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between comorbidity and types of postoperative complications with special attention to age differences.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a31","authors":["Thomas T A Peters","Boukje A C van Dijk","Jan L N Roodenburg","Bernard F A M van der Laan","Gyorgy B Halmos","Peters TT","van Dijk BA","Roodenburg JL","van der Laan BF","Halmos GB","Thomas T.
