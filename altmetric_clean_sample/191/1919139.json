In 150 flocks, ten serum samples of adult ewes were analysed for Se concentration. The farmers were interviewed concerning flock size, provision of mineral supplement, predominant form of husbandry (stationary fenced pasture\/transhumance), predominant form of water provision (tap water\/well\/surface water) and predominant soil (sandy, silty\/loamy, clay) in the area. The location of the flock was recorded as well as the production stage\/season at the time of sampling. Intra-group variation and the validity to analyse pooled samples were tested.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008ad","doi":"10.1186\/1751-0147-55-82","first_seen_on":"2013-11-20T11:54:39+00:00","issns":["1751-0147"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1384948472,"links":["http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/55\/1\/82\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24245607?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.actavetscand.com\/content\/pdf\/1751-0147-55-82.pdf","pmid":"24245607","pubdate":"2013-11-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"82","title":"Variation of serum selenium concentrations in German sheep flocks and implications for herd health management consultancy","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/variation-serum-selenium-concentrations-german-sheep-flocks-implications-herd-health-management-cons-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2913973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1441936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115678,"mean":7.1114664799401,"rank":71915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":40087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115678,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":2.3035563380282,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1692307692308,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
