This secondary data analysis studied the relationship between child and parent liking, and parent intake and child intake of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, snack foods, and sweetened beverages in 4- to 9-year-old overweight\/obese (body mass index \u226585th percentile) children presenting for obesity treatment (September 2005 to September 2007) in Providence, RI. One hundred thirty-five parent-child pairs, with complete baseline dietary (3-day food record) and food group hedonic data were included. Hedonic ratings were mean ratings using a 5-point Likert scale (lower scores represented greater liking of a food group). Children were aged 7.2\u00b11.6 years, 63.0% girls, 12.6% African American, and 17.8% Hispanic, with a mean body mass index z score of 2.3\u00b10.6. Total servings consumed by children over 3 days were: fruits 2.7\u00b13.2, vegetables 3.4\u00b12.5, low-fat dairy 2.4\u00b12.1, snack foods 5.9\u00b14.2, and sweetened beverages 2.7\u00b13.1. After demographic and anthropometric variables were controlled, parent intake was positively related (P<0.05) to child intake of all food groups except sweetened beverages. Child liking was only significantly (P<0.05) related to child intake of vegetables. In young children with obesity\/overweight, parent intake was consistently related to child intake. Changing parent intake may be important in helping to change the dietary intake of young children with overweight\/obesity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040f7","authors":["Hollie Raynor","Emily L.
