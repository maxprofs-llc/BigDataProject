This review will focus on the findings from several macromolecular epithelial transport experiments and drug permeability studies to provide a recent comprehension of food allergen intestinal epithelial cell transport and the allergen-epithelial relationship. Specifically, this review will aim to answer whether allergens can permeate the intestinal barrier directly via intestinal epithelial cells, and whether this mode of transport affects downstream immune reactions. By improving our understanding of the interactions which take place during exposure of food allergens with the intestinal epithelium, we can begin to understand whether the epithelial barrier plays a major role in the allergic sensitization process rather than simply restricting the entry of allergens to the underlying lamina propria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81e3cf058f61000bbd2","authors":["Price, Dwan","Ackland, Leigh","Suphioglu, Cenk"],"doi":"10.5415\/apallergy.2013.3.4.257","first_seen_on":"2013-11-19T13:55:08+00:00","issns":["2233-8276"],"journal":"Asia Pacific Allergy","last_mentioned_on":1385206709,"links":["http:\/\/www.apallergy.org\/search.php?where=aview&id=10.5415\/apallergy.2013.3.4.257&code=9996APA&vmode=FT","http:\/\/apallergy.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.5415\/apallergy.2013.3.4.257","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24260731","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24260731?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24260731","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Nuts 'n' guts: transport of food allergens across the intestinal epithelium","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nuts-n-guts-transport-food-allergens-across-intestinal-epithelium"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":871118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4161984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124203,"mean":7.1935657074768,"rank":22698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":101378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124203,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":1.7632075471698,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
