The reactivation of a memory through re-exposure to salient training stimuli results in its destabilization, necessitating a restabilization process known as reconsolidation, a disruption of which leads to amnesia. I found that one normal function of hippocampal memory reconsolidation in rats is to modify the strength of a contextual-fear memory as a result of further learning.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Jonathan L C Lee"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn.2205","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:33:20+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1546-1726","1097-6256"],"issue":"11","journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1450715051,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18849987","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v11\/n11\/full\/nn.2205.html"],"pmid":"18849987","pubdate":"2008-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Memory reconsolidation mediates the strengthening of memories by additional learning","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/memory-reconsolidation-mediates-strengthening-memories-additional-learning"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059254,"mean":6.8391404707078,"rank":3787987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4092534,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059254,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250289,"mean":5.0860443888642,"rank":94475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":147332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250289,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3397,"mean":31.208010600707,"rank":2552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3397,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":7.1733698630137,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":26,"Researcher":59,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
