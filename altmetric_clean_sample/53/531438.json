One of the recommendations of this consensus was that centers should maintain multidisciplinary teams for providing care and support to these patients and their families. However, the specifics for how this should be accomplished were not addressed in the original consensus statement. Here we interpret and translate the 2002 consensus statement recommendations into medical, surgical and mental health protocols. Additionally, we provide preliminary evidence that such protocols result in improved care and support for patients and families.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000083d","authors":["Schaeffer TL","Tryggestad JB","Mallappa A","Hanna AE","Krishnan S","Chernausek SD","Chalmers LJ","Reiner WG","Kropp BP","Wisniewski AB"],"doi":"10.1155\/2010\/692439","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T08:47:36+00:00","issns":["1687-9848","1687-9856"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1272931200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20339513","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2010\/692439"],"pmcid":"PMC2842898","pmid":"20339513","pubdate":"2010-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","title":"An Evidence-Based Model of Multidisciplinary Care for Patients and Families Affected by Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency","type":"article","volume":"2010","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidencebased-model-multidisciplinary-care-patients-families-affected-classical-congenital-adrenal-h-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231902,"mean":3.9143511498444,"rank":99998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231902,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.7516086956522,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/3083956","license":"public","citation_ids":[531438],"posted_on":"2010-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
