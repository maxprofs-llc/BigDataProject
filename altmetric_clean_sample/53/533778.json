In C. elegans, we show that GLP-1\/Notch signaling functions in the germline to modulate oocyte growth when sperm are available for fertilization and the major sperm protein (MSP) hormone is present. Reduction-of-function mutations in glp-1 cause oocytes to grow abnormally large when MSP is present and Galpha(s)-adenylate cyclase signaling in the gonadal sheath cells is active. By contrast, gain-of-function glp-1 mutations lead to the production of small oocytes. Surprisingly, proper oocyte growth depends on distal tip cell signaling involving the redundant function of GLP-1 ligands LAG-2 and APX-1. GLP-1 signaling also affects two cellular oocyte growth processes, actomyosin-dependent cytoplasmic streaming and oocyte cellularization. glp-1 reduction-of-function mutants exhibit elevated rates of cytoplasmic streaming and delayed cellularization. GLP-1 signaling in oocyte growth depends in part on the downstream function of the FBF-1\/2 PUF RNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, abnormal oocyte growth in glp-1 mutants, but not the inappropriate differentiation of germline stem cells, requires the function of the cell death pathway. The data support a model in which GLP-1 function in MSP-dependent oocyte growth is separable from its role in the proliferation versus meiotic entry decision. Thus, two major germline signaling centers, distal GLP-1 activation and proximal MSP signaling, coordinate several spatially and temporally distinct processes by which germline stem cells differentiate into functional oocytes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Nadarajan S","Govindan JA","McGovern M","Hubbard EJ","Greenstein D"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.034603","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:50:41+00:00","issns":["0950-1991","1477-9129"],"issue":"13","journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1244505600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19502484","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1242\/dev.034603"],"pmcid":"PMC2729341","pmid":"19502484","pubdate":"2009-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Company of Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"MSP and GLP-1\/Notch signaling coordinately regulate actomyosin-dependent\ncytoplasmic streaming and oocyte growth in C. elegans","type":"article","volume":"136","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/msp-glp1notch-signaling-coordinately-regulate-actomyosindependent-cytoplasmic-streaming-oocyte-growt"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9285227185855,"rank":2015924,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":926348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231754,"mean":3.9500931854174,"rank":100643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231754,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3314,"mean":3.6777597343797,"rank":1824,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3314,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":325,"mean":5.5538827160494,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":325,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
