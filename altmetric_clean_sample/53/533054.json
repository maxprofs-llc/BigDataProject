Trimethoprim is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Kinetic flux profiling with (15)N-labeled ammonia in Escherichia coli reveals that trimethoprim leads to blockade not only of DHFR but also of another critical enzyme of folate metabolism: folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FP-gamma-GS). Inhibition of FP-gamma-GS is not directly due to trimethoprim. Instead, it arises from accumulation of DHFR's substrate dihydrofolate, which we show is a potent FP-gamma-GS inhibitor. Thus, owing to the inherent connectivity of the metabolic network, falling DHFR activity leads to falling FP-gamma-GS activity in a domino-like cascade. This cascade results in complex folate dynamics, and its incorporation in a computational model of folate metabolism recapitulates the dynamics observed experimentally. These results highlight the potential for quantitative analysis of cellular metabolism to reveal mechanisms of drug action.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f610004264","authors":["Kwon YK","Lu W","Melamud E","Khanam N","Bognar A","Rabinowitz JD"],"doi":"10.1038\/nchembio.108","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:30:20+00:00","issns":["1552-4450","1552-4469"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1222992000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18724364","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nchembio.108"],"pmcid":"PMC2699209","pmid":"18724364","pubdate":"2008-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"A domino effect in antifolate drug action in Escherichia coli","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/domino-effect-antifolate-drug-action-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628259,"mean":4.9430875566221,"rank":2017497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628259,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231889,"mean":3.9352328192923,"rank":100346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231889,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1039,"mean":9.3284277456647,"rank":717,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1039,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":5.1303636363636,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
