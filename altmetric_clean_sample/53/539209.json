It inhibits cytokine production and cell proliferation\/differentiation in various immune cells. This study showed that a brief exposure of LeTx caused a continual MEK1 cleavage and prevented tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in non-proliferating cells such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or mouse primary peritoneal macrophages. In human monocytic cell lines U-937 and THP-1, LeTx induced cell cycle arrest in G0-G1 phase by rapid down-regulation of cyclin D1\/D2 and checkpoint kinase 1 through MEK1 inhibition. However, THP-1 cells adaptively adjusted to LeTx and overrode cell cycle arrest by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\/Akt signaling pathway. Inhibitory Ser-9 phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) by Akt prevented proteasome-mediated cyclin D1 degradation and induced cell cycle progress in LeTx-intoxicated THP-1 cells. Recovery from cell cycle arrest was required before recovering from on-going MEK1 cleavage and suppression of TNF production. Furthermore, pretreatment with LeTx or the GSK3-specific inhibitor SB-216763, or transfection with dominant active mutant Akt or degradation-defected mutant cyclin D1 protected cells from LeTx-induced cell cycle arrest, on-going MEK1 cleavage and suppression of TNF production. These results indicate that modulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\/Akt\/GSK3beta signaling cascades can be beneficial for protecting or facilitating recovery from cellular LeTx intoxication in cells that depend on basal MEK1 activity for proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Ha, Soon-Duck","Ng, Dennis","Pelech, Steven L","Kim, Sung Ouk"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m707622200","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:53:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"50","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1194480000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17951252"],"pmid":"17951252","pubdate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Critical role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\/Akt\/glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling pathway in recovery from anthrax lethal toxin-induced cell cycle arrest and MEK cleavage in macrophages.","type":"article","volume":"282","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/critical-role-phosphatidylinositol-3kinaseaktglycogen-synthase-kinase3-signaling-pathway-recovery-an"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628824,"mean":4.9380564480592,"rank":2016474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":938101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628824,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231894,"mean":3.9273971788715,"rank":100211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231894,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6426579651225,"rank":19785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5535872483221,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
