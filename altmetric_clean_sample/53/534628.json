Although it has long been assumed that cognitive functions are attributable to the isolated operations of single brain areas, we demonstrate that the weight of evidence has now shifted in support of the view that cognition results from the dynamic interactions of distributed brain areas operating in large-scale networks. We review current research on structural and functional brain organization, and argue that the emerging science of large-scale brain networks provides a coherent framework for understanding of cognition. Critically, this framework allows a principled exploration of how cognitive functions emerge from, and are constrained by, core structural and functional networks of the brain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a8","authors":["Bressler SL","Menon V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tics.2010.04.004","endpage":"290","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:11:49+00:00","issns":["1364-6613","13646613"],"issue":"6","journal":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1472040876,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20493761","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1364661310000896","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/20493761\/"],"pmid":"20493761","pubdate":"2010-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"277","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Large-scale brain networks in cognition: emerging methods and principles","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-brain-networks-cognition-emerging-methods-principles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":3366193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4847130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251465,"mean":5.1564168389911,"rank":75356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":173895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251465,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1298,"mean":23.156863531226,"rank":1058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":224,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1298,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":12.702585365854,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":24,"Professor > Associate Professor":99,"Librarian":4,"Researcher":336,"Student  > Doctoral Student":85,"Student  > Ph.
