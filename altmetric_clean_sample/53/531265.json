However, striatal involvement has not yet been shown conclusively in autism. Issues include the use of neuroleptic medication and differences in mean age between samples, where conflicting results may reflect differences in developmental stage between samples. The objective was to examine brain development in a homogeneous sample of subjects with high-functioning autism.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d9","authors":["Langen M","Schnack HG","Nederveen H","Bos D","Lahuis BE","de Jonge MV","van Engeland H","Durston S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biopsych.2009.03.017","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T08:43:29+00:00","issns":["0006-3223"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1259712000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19423078","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biopsych.2009.03.017"],"pmid":"19423078","pubdate":"2009-05-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Biological Psychiatry","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychiatry"],"title":"Changes in the Developmental Trajectories of Striatum in Autism","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-developmental-trajectories-striatum-autism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632408,"mean":4.9240837059336,"rank":2015262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632408,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231912,"mean":3.906496828525,"rank":99835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231912,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1650,"mean":6.4478920557914,"rank":1101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1650,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.4554838709677,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
