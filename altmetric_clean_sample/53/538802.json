These proteins are oriented in cell membranes such that most of the protein resides in a cytosolic compartment. Evaluation of SNARE protein localization in activated platelets using immunonanogold staining and electron microscopy, however, demonstrated expression of SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 on the extracellular surface of the platelet plasma membrane. Flow cytometry of intact platelets confirmed trypsin-sensitive SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 localization to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. Acyl-protein thioesterase 1 and botulinum toxin C light chain released SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2, respectively, from the surface of intact platelets. When resting platelets were incubated with both acyl-protein thioesterase 1 and botulinum toxin C light chain, a complex that included both SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 was detected in supernatants, indicating that extracellular SNARE proteins retain their ability to bind one another. These observations represent the first description of SNARE proteins on the extracellular surface of a cell.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Flaumenhaft R","Rozenvayn N","Feng D","Dvorak AM"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2006-11-055772","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:41:24+00:00","issns":["1528-0020"],"issue":"5","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1192579200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17485553","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2006-11-055772"],"pmid":"17485553","pubdate":"2007-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Hematology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"SNAP-23 and syntaxin-2 localize to the extracellular surface of the platelet plasma membrane","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/snap23-syntaxin2-localize-extracellular-surface-platelet-plasma-membrane"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":2015774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231900,"mean":3.9185773116748,"rank":100065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231900,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6906,"mean":2.7401112237509,"rank":3606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6906,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":1.6341225554107,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
