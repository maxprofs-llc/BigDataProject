It is thought that the AT2 receptor counteracts these processes; however, recent studies have found proinflammatory and hypertrophic effects of this receptor subtype. To identify the physiological roles of the AT2 receptor in chronic kidney disease, we performed renal ablation in AT2 receptor knockout and wild-type mice. Renal injury caused a greater impairment of renal function, glomerular injury, albuminuria, and mortality in the knockout mice than in the wild-type mice. There was increased fibronectin expression and inflammation in the knockout mice, as shown by augmented monocyte\/macrophage infiltration and higher chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and RANTES expression in the remnant kidney. The higher mortality and renal morbidity of the knockout mice was not due to differences in systemic blood pressure, glomerular volume, AT1 receptor, renin, or endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Whether activation of the AT2 receptor will have therapeutic benefit in chronic kidney disease will require further study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Benndorf RA","Krebs C","Hirsch-Hoffmann B","Schwedhelm E","Cieslar G","Schmidt-Haupt R","Steinmetz OM","Meyer-Schwesinger C","Thaiss F","Haddad M","Fehr S","Heilmann A","Helmchen U","Hein L","Ehmke H","Stahl RA","B\u00f6ger RH","Wenzel UO"],"doi":"10.1038\/ki.2009.2","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:47:10+00:00","issns":["00852538"],"issue":"10","journal":"Kidney International","last_mentioned_on":1242172800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19212419","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ki.2009.2"],"pmid":"19212419","pubdate":"2009-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Angiotensin II type 2 receptor deficiency aggravates renal injury and reduces survival in chronic kidney disease in mice.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angiotensin-ii-type-2-receptor-deficiency-aggravates-renal-injury-reduces-survival-chronic-kidney-di-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":2015303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":943475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231907,"mean":3.9110766603713,"rank":99931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90915,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231907,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1582,"mean":3.1895382669197,"rank":847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1582,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.9936,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
