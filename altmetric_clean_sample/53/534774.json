N-Acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST) transfers sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to position 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate in CS or DS to yield GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues. We here report generation of transgenic mice that lack GalNAc4S-6ST. GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were born normally and fertile. In GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice, GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in CS and DS disappeared completely, indicating that GalNAc4S-6ST should be a sole enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in both CS and DS. IdoA-GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) units that account for approximately 40% of total disaccharide units of DS in the liver of the wild-type mice disappeared in the liver DS of GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice without reduction of IdoA content. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice contained CS without GlcA-GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) units. Tryptase and carboxypeptidase A activities of BMMCs derived from GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice were lower than those activities of BMMCs derived from wild-type mice, although mRNA expression of these mast cell proteases was not altered. Disaccharide compositions of heparan sulfate\/heparin contained in the mast cells derived from BMMCs in the presence of stem cell factor were much different from those of heparan sulfate\/heparin in BMMCs but did not differ significantly between wild-type mice and GalNAc4S-6ST-null mice. These observations suggest that CS containing GalNAc(4,6-SO(4)) residues in BMMCs may contribute to retain the active proteases in the granules of BMMCs but not for the maturation of BMMCs into connective tissue-type mast cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Ohtake-Niimi S","Kondo S","Ito T","Kakehi S","Ohta T","Habuchi H","Kimata K","Habuchi O"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m109.084749","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:15:43+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"issue":"27","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1277942400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20439988","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M109.084749"],"pmid":"20439988","pubdate":"2010-02-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Mice Deficient in N-Acetylgalactosamine 4-Sulfate 6-O-Sulfotransferase Are Unable to Synthesize Chondroitin\/Dermatan Sulfate containing N-Acetylgalactosamine 4,6-Bissulfate Residues and Exhibit Decreased Protease Activity in Bone Marrow-derived Mast Cells","type":"article","volume":"285","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mice-deficient-nacetylgalactosamine-4sulfate-6osulfotransferase-unable-synthesize-chondroitindermata"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231903,"mean":3.9140619572064,"rank":99995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231903,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6398796091577,"rank":19769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4087,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5503489932886,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
