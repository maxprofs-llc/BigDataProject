A striking example is provided by recent crystal structures of the p38 MAP kinase, where a 10A movement of the Phe169 side-chain creates a new binding site adjacent to the ATP binding site that is exploited by the diaryl urea inhibitor BIRB796. Here, we show that this binding site can be successfully and repeatedly identified in explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the protein that begin from an unliganded p38 crystal structure. Ligand-docking calculations performed on 5000 different structural snapshots generated during MD indicate that the conformations sampled are often surprisingly competent to bind the inhibitor BIRB796 in the crystallographically correct position and with docked energies that are generally more favorable than those of other positions. Similar docking studies with an ATP-binding site-directed inhibitor suggest that it may be possible to develop hybrid inhibitors that target both the ATP and cryptic binding sites simultaneously. Intriguingly, both inhibitors are occasionally found to dock correctly even with p38's \"DFG\" motif in the \"wrong\" conformation and BIRB796 can successfully dock, albeit infrequently, without significant displacement of the Phe169 side-chain; this suggests that the inhibitor might facilitate the latter's conformational change. Finally, two quite different conformations of p38's DFG motif are also sampled for extended periods of time during the simulations; these may provide new opportunities for inhibitor development. The MD simulations reported here, which total 390 ns in length, therefore demonstrate that existing computational methods may be of surprising utility in predicting cryptic binding sites in protein receptors prior to their experimental discovery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5c","authors":["Frembgen-Kesner T","Elcock AH"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmb.2006.03.021","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:36:59+00:00","issns":["0022-2836"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1189555200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16616932","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jmb.2006.03.021"],"pmid":"16616932","pubdate":"2006-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Computational sampling of a cryptic drug binding site in a protein receptor: explicit solvent molecular dynamics and inhibitor docking to p38 MAP kinase.","type":"article","volume":"359","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-sampling-cryptic-drug-binding-site-protein-receptor-explicit-solvent-molecular-dynamic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2018195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231924,"mean":3.896715797916,"rank":99673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231924,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3302,"mean":2.5179527415935,"rank":2225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3302,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":0.95833333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
