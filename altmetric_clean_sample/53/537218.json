The role of CO in regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and biogenesis associated with sepsis has not been investigated. In the present study, we employed a ruthenium-based water-soluble CO carrier, tricarbonylchoro(glycinato)ruthenium (II) (CORM-3), one of the novel CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), to test whether CO can improve cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction and survival in peritonitis-induced sepsis. Peritonitis was performed in mice by cecal ligation and perforation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10, and nitrite\/nitrate plasma levels were tested to evaluate the systemic inflammatory response. Functional mitochondrial studies included determination of membrane potential, respiration, and redox status. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measurements of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide, carbonyl protein and GSH levels. Mitochondrial biogenesis was assessed by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1alpha protein expression and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. The systemic inflammatory response elicited by peritonitis was accompanied by mitochondrial energetic metabolism deterioration and reduced PGC-1alpha protein expression. CORM-3 treatment in septic mice restored the deleterious effects of sepsis on mitochondrial membrane potential, respiratory control ratio, and energetics. It is interesting that administration of CORM-3 during sepsis elicited a mild oxidative stress response that stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis with PGC-1alpha protein expression and mtDNA copy number increases. Our results reveal that delivery of controlled amounts of CO dramatically reduced mortality in septic mice, indicating that CO-RMs could be used therapeutically to prevent organ dysfunction and death in sepsis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007de2","authors":["Lancel S","Hassoun SM","Favory R","Decoster B","Motterlini R","Neviere R"],"doi":"10.1124\/jpet.108.148049","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:14:00+00:00","issns":["1521-0103 (Online)","1521-0103"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1248048000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19190234","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1124\/jpet.108.148049"],"pmid":"19190234","pubdate":"2009-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ASPET","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Carbon Monoxide Rescues Mice from Lethal Sepsis by Supporting Mitochondrial Energetic Metabolism and Activating Mitochondrial Biogenesis","type":"article","volume":"329","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/carbon-monoxide-rescues-mice-lethal-sepsis-supporting-mitochondrial-energetic-metabolism-activating"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.9206251576887,"rank":2018549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231928,"mean":3.8954799656791,"rank":99651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231928,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1522,"mean":2.8306666666667,"rank":971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1522,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":2.0916923076923,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
