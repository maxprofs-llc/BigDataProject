In Caenorhabditis elegans, an epithelial cell named Y is initially part of the rectum but later appears to withdraw, migrate, and then become a motor neuron named PDA. Here, we show that this represents a bona fide transdifferentiation event: Y has epithelial hallmarks without detectable neural characteristics, and PDA has no residual epithelial characteristics. Using available mutants and laser microsurgery, we found that transdifferentiation does not depend on fusion with a neighboring cell or require migration of Y away from the rectum, that other rectal epithelial cells are not competent to transdifferentiate, and that transdifferentiation requires the EGL-5 and SEM-4 transcription factors and LIN-12\/Notch signaling. Our results establish Y-to-PDA transdifferentiation as a genetically tractable model for deciphering the mechanisms underlying cellular plasticity in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008PNAS..105.3790J","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Jarriault, Sophie","Schwab, Yannick","Greenwald, Iva"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.0712159105","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:18:24+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1091-6490"],"issue":"10","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1204675200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18308937"],"pmcid":"PMC2268801","pmid":"18308937","pubdate":"2008-03-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A Caenorhabditis elegans model for epithelial-neuronal transdifferentiation.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caenorhabditis-elegans-model-epithelialneuronal-transdifferentiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630432,"mean":4.9299514944696,"rank":2015611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":941965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630432,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231902,"mean":3.9151827805834,"rank":100012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":90767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231902,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33585,"mean":13.628871903287,"rank":23197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33585,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":766,"mean":12.254732026144,"rank":485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":766,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
