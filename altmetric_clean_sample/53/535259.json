Photoperiodic decoding relies on circadian clocks, but the\u00a0underlying molecular pathways have remained elusive [1]. In mammals and birds, photoperiodic responses depend crucially on expression of thyrotrophin \u03b2 subunit RNA (TSH\u03b2) in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary gland [2-4]. Now, using our well-characterized Soay sheep model [2], we describe a molecular switch governing TSH\u03b2 transcription through the circadian clock. Central to this is a conserved D element in the TSH\u03b2 promoter, controlled by the circadian transcription factor thyrotroph embryonic factor (Tef). In the PT, long-day exposure rapidly induces expression of the coactivator eyes absent 3 (Eya3), which synergizes with Tef to maximize TSH\u03b2 transcription. The pineal hormone melatonin, secreted nocturnally, sets the phase of rhythmic Eya3 expression in the PT to peak 12\u00a0hr after nightfall. Additionally, nocturnal melatonin levels directly suppress Eya3 expression. Together, these effects form a switch triggering a strong morning peak of Eya3 expression under long days. Species variability in the TSH\u03b2 D element influences sensitivity to TEF, reflecting species variability in photoperiodic responsiveness. Our findings define a molecular pathway linking the circadian clock to the evolution of seasonal timing in mammals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["Dardente H","Wyse CA","Birnie MJ","Dupr\u00e9 SM","Loudon AS","Lincoln GA","Hazlerigg DG","Hugues Dardente","Cathy A.
