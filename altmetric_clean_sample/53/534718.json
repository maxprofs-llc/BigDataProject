Although infection-induced immunodepression can favour the establishment of the parasite within the host, a too severe immunodepression may increase the risk of infection with opportunistic pathogens, stopping the period over which the parasite can be transmitted to other hosts. Here, we explore how the risk of contracting opportunistic diseases affects the survival of the amphipod Gammarus pulex infected by the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis. Previous work with this system has shown that upon infection, G. pulex has a substantially reduced immune response. Non-infected and P. laevis-infected hosts were maintained either in control or in micro-organism-enriched water, so as to vary the risk of encountering opportunistic pathogens. As predicted, we found that host mortality was exacerbated when infected gammarids were maintained in micro-organism-enriched water compared with clean, control water; whereas for non-infected gammarids, living in micro-organism-enriched water only moderately increased the risk of mortality. These results show that the virulence of parasites that reduce the host immune response is an environmentally sensitive trait that depends on the concomitant risk for the host of contracting opportunistic diseases. This extra source of host mortality probably represents a cost for P. laevis, and we tentatively predict that the optimal level of parasite exploitation should depend on environmental conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["Cornet S","Sorci G"],"doi":"10.1098\/rspb.2010.0138","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:14:08+00:00","issns":["1471-2954"],"issue":"1689","journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1280966400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20200031","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1098\/rspb.2010.0138"],"pmid":"20200031","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Parasite virulence when the infection reduces the host immune response","type":"article","volume":"277","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parasite-virulence-infection-reduces-host-immune-response"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":2015205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231918,"mean":3.901193125127,"rank":99731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231918,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3674,"mean":15.839478900082,"rank":2958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3674,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":15.479704180064,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Ph.
