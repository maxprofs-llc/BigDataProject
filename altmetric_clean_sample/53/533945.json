In direct comparisons with anionic contrast agents, the cationic contrast agents afforded higher equilibrium concentrations in the articular cartilage of ex vivo rabbit femurs and thus greater imaging sensitivity. Variations in CT intensity across the sample reflected the inhomogeneous distribution of glycosaminoglycans in the tissue as confirmed by histological analysis. We anticipate that this work represents the first step in the development of sensitive, nondestructive CT-based methods to characterize the biochemical properties of cartilage using cationic contrast agents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Joshi NS","Bansal PN","Stewart RC","Snyder BD","Grinstaff MW"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja9053306","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:54:16+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"issue":"37","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1254700800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19754183","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja9053306"],"pmid":"19754183","pubdate":"2009-09-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ACS Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Effect of Contrast Agent Charge on Visualization of Articular Cartilage Using Computed Tomography: Exploiting Electrostatic Interactions for Improved Sensitivity","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-contrast-agent-charge-visualization-articular-cartilage-using-computed-tomography-exploiting-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":2016284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":927330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231765,"mean":3.9491005419307,"rank":100628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231765,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12977,"mean":4.1399116831073,"rank":8155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12977,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":4.9127299270073,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
