We show here that epithelial microRNAs mediate the mucosa-immune system crosstalk necessary for mounting protective T helper type 2 (T(H)2) responses. Abolishing the induction of microRNA by gut-specific deletion of Dicer1 (Dicer1(\u0394gut)), which encodes an enzyme involved in microRNA biogenesis, deprived goblet cells of RELM\u03b2, a key T(H)2 antiparasitic cytokine; this predisposed the host to parasite infection. Infection of Dicer1(\u0394gut) mice with helminths favored a futile T(H)1 response with hallmarks of inflammatory bowel disease. Interleukin 13 (IL-13) induced the microRNA miR-375, which regulates the expression of TSLP, a T(H)2-facilitating epithelial cytokine; this indicated a T(H)2-amplification loop. We found that miR-375 was required for RELM\u03b2 expression in vivo; miR-375-deficient mice had significantly less intestinal RELM\u03b2, which possibly explains the greater susceptibility of Dicer1(\u0394gut) mice to parasites. Our findings indicate that epithelial microRNAs are key regulators of gut homeostasis and mucosal immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Biton M","Levin A","Slyper M","Alkalay I","Horwitz E","Mor H","Kredo-Russo S","Avnit-Sagi T","Cojocaru G","Zreik F","Bentwich Z","Poy MN","Artis D","Walker MD","Hornstein E","Pikarsky E","Ben-Neriah Y"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.1994","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:34:29+00:00","issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1299628800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21278735","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/v12\/n3\/full\/ni.1994.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.1994"],"pmid":"21278735","pubdate":"2011-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Epithelial microRNAs regulate gut mucosal immunity via epithelium-T cell crosstalk","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epithelial-micrornas-regulate-gut-mucosal-immunity-via-epitheliumt-cell-crosstalk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.088,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.088},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9072834051191,"rank":503124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3181070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232067,"mean":3.8949351477599,"rank":29962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":202104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232067,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1569,"mean":4.8615790816327,"rank":239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1569,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.1859655172414,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":59,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
