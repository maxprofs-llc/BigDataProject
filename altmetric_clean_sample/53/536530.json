Leptin is a pleiotropic cytokine important in the regulation of immune responses via its functional receptor Ob-Rb. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that severe COPD is associated with increased leptin expression in epithelial cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003664","authors":["Vernooy JH","Drummen NE","van Suylen RJ","Cloots RH","M\u00f6ller GM","Bracke KR","Zuyderduyn S","Dentener MA","Brusselle GG","Hiemstra PS","Wouters EF","J H J Vernooy","N E A Drummen","R J van Suylen","R H E Cloots","G M M\u00f6ller","K R Bracke","S Zuyderduyn","M A Dentener","G G Brusselle","P S Hiemstra","E F M Wouters"],"doi":"10.1136\/thx.2007.085423","endpage":"32","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:00:34+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-537346","handles":["1854\/LU-537346"],"issns":["1468-3296","0040-6376"],"issue":"1","journal":"Thorax","last_mentioned_on":1231200000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18835960","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/thx.2007.085423","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/thx.2007.085423"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/thorax.bmj.com\/content\/thoraxjnl\/64\/1\/26.full.pdf","pmid":"18835960","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and British Thoracic Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"26","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Enhanced pulmonary leptin expression in patients with severe COPD and asymptomatic smokers","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-pulmonary-leptin-expression-patients-severe-copd-asymptomatic-smokers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":2016869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231890,"mean":3.9304419183319,"rank":100275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231890,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1487,"mean":4.925531628533,"rank":950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1487,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":2.7248307692308,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
