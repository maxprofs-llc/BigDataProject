Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2, are activated after the stimulation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and are necessary for the optimal production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). We uncovered a role for the extracellular nutrient arginine in the activation of ERK1\/2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Arginine facilitated the activation of MAPKs by preventing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of the MAPK kinase kinase tumor-promoting locus 2 (TPL-2). Starvation of mice decreased the concentration of arginine in the plasma and impaired the activation of ERK1\/2 by LPS. Supplementation of starved mice with arginine promoted the subsequent activation of ERK1\/2 and the production of TNF-alpha in response to LPS. Thus, arginine is critical for two aspects of the innate immune response in macrophages: It is the precursor used in the generation of the antimicrobial mediator nitric oxide, and it facilitates MAPK activation and consequently cytokine production.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088bc","authors":["Mieulet V","Yan L","Choisy C","Sully K","Procter J","Kouroumalis A","Krywawych S","Pende M","Ley SC","Moinard C","Lamb RF"],"doi":"10.1126\/scisignal.2000934","endpage":"ra61","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:18:45+00:00","issns":["","1937-9145"],"issue":"135","journal":"Science Signaling","last_mentioned_on":1283904000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20716763","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/scisignal.2000934"],"pmid":"20716763","pubdate":"2010-08-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"ra61","subjects":["science","cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"TPL-2\u2013Mediated Activation of MAPK Downstream of TLR4 Signaling Is Coupled to Arginine Availability","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tpl2mediated-activation-mapk-downstream-tlr4-signaling-coupled-arginine-availability-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628302,"mean":4.942517914036,"rank":2017421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628302,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231889,"mean":3.9346371610435,"rank":100334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231889,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1200,"mean":6.6647539616347,"rank":818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1200,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":3.2263661971831,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
