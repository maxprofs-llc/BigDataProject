Several studies demonstrated the unique gene expression profile associated with MLL-rearranged ALL, but generally small cohorts were analyzed as uniform patient groups regardless of the type of MLL translocation, whereas the analysis of translocation-negative infant ALL remained unacknowledged. Here we generated and analyzed primary infant ALL expression profiles (n = 73) typified by translocations t(4;11), t(11;19), and t(9;11), or the absence of MLL translocations. Our data show that MLL germline infant ALL specifies a gene expression pattern that is different from both MLL-rearranged infant ALL and pediatric precursor B-ALL. Moreover, we demonstrate that, apart from a fundamental signature shared by all MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples, each type of MLL translocation is associated with a translocation-specific gene expression signature. Finally, we show the existence of 2 distinct subgroups among t(4;11)-positive infant ALL cases characterized by the absence or presence of HOXA expression, and that patients lacking HOXA expression are at extreme high risk of disease relapse. These gene expression profiles should provide important novel insights in the complex biology of MLL-rearranged infant ALL and boost our progress in finding novel therapeutic solutions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Stam RW","Schneider P","Hagelstein JA","van der Linden MH","Stumpel DJ","de Menezes RX","de Lorenzo P","Valsecchi MG","Pieters R"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2009-07-233049","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T08:50:31+00:00","issns":["0006-4971","1528-0020"],"issue":"14","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1275955200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20032505","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1182\/blood-2009-07-233049"],"pmid":"20032505","pubdate":"2009-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Gene expression profiling\u2013based dissection of MLL translocated and MLL germline acute lymphoblastic leukemia in infants","type":"article","volume":"115","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-expression-profilingbased-dissection-mll-translocated-mll-germline-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2016431,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231923,"mean":3.8985794189429,"rank":99672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231923,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6908,"mean":2.7367247719705,"rank":3614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6908,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":1.6299504563233,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
