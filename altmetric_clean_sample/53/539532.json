A conditional temperature-sensitive (TS) mutant (rbo(ts)) displays paralysis within minutes following a temperature shift from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C, an impairment previously attributed solely to blocked synaptic-vesicle exocytosis. However, we found that rbo(ts) displays a strong synergistic interaction with the Syntaxin-1A TS allele syx(3-69), recently shown to be a dominant positive mutant that increases Syntaxin-1A function. At neuromuscular synapses, rbo(ts) showed a strong defect in styryl-FM-dye (FM) endocytosis, and rbo(ts);syx(3-69) double mutants displayed a synergistic, more severe, endocytosis impairment. Similarly, central rbo(ts) synapses in primary brain culture showed severely defective FM endocytosis. Non-neuronal nephrocyte Garland cells showed the same endocytosis defect in tracer-uptake assays. Ultrastructurally, rbo(ts) displayed a specific defect in tracer uptake into endosomes in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. At the rbo(ts) synapse, there was a total blockade of endosome formation via activity-dependent bulk endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis was not affected; indeed, there was a significant increase in direct vesicle formation. Together, these results demonstrate that RBO is required for constitutive and\/or bulk endocytosis and\/or macropinocytosis in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, and that, at the synapse, this mechanism is responsive to the rate of Syntaxin-1A-dependent exocytosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Vijayakrishnan N","Woodruff EA 3rd","Broadie K"],"doi":"10.1242\/jcs.036673","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T12:10:27+00:00","issns":["0021-9533","1477-9137"],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"Journal of Cell Science","last_mentioned_on":1231804800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19066280","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1242\/jcs.036673"],"pmcid":"PMC2714403","pmid":"19066280","pubdate":"2008-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Company of Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Rolling blackout is required for bulk endocytosis in non-neuronal cells and neuronal synapses","type":"article","volume":"122","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rolling-blackout-required-bulk-endocytosis-nonneuronal-cells-neuronal-synapses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":2017358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":935742,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231889,"mean":3.9336729800596,"rank":100326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231889,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2327,"mean":3.4681427343078,"rank":1358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2327,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":1.8216615384615,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Ph.
