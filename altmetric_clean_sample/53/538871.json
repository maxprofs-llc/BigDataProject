Using cryo-EM and three-dimensional reconstruction, we show that ParM filaments have a different structure from F-actin, with very different subunit-subunit interfaces. These interfaces result in the helical handedness of the ParM filament being opposite to that of F-actin. Like F-actin, ParM filaments have a variable twist, and we show that this involves domain-domain rotations within the ParM subunit. The present results yield new insights into polymorphisms within F-actin, as well as the evolution of polymer families.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Orlova A","Garner EC","Galkin VE","Heuser J","Mullins RD","Egelman EH"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb1300","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:42:59+00:00","issns":["1545-9993","1545-9985"],"issue":"10","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1195516800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17873883","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nsmb1300"],"pmid":"17873883","pubdate":"2007-01-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Ieee","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"The structure of bacterial ParM filaments","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structure-bacterial-parm-filaments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":2016881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937042,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231890,"mean":3.9305878502217,"rank":100274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":90272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231890,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1507,"mean":5.3026786188579,"rank":911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1507,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.6207636363636,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
