The RP is further subdivided into lid and base subcomplexes. Little is known about RP assembly. Here, we show that four conserved assembly factors govern biogenesis of the yeast RP base. Nas2 forms a complex with the Rpt4 and Rpt5 ATPases and enhances 26S proteasome formation in vivo and in vitro. Other RP subcomplexes contain Hsm3, which is related to mammalian proteasome subunit S5b. Hsm3 also contributes to base assembly. Larger Hsm3-containing complexes include two additional proteins, Nas6 and Rpn14, which function as assembly chaperones as well. Specific deletion combinations affecting these four factors cause severe perturbations to RP assembly. Our results demonstrate that proteasomal RP biogenesis requires multiple, functionally overlapping chaperones and suggest a model in which subunits form specific subcomplexes that then assemble into the base.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Funakoshi, Minoru","Tomko, Robert J","Kobayashi, Hideki","Hochstrasser, Mark"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cell.2009.04.061","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:48:33+00:00","issns":["1097-4172"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1438508014,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19446322"],"pmcid":"PMC2718848","pmid":"19446322","pubdate":"2009-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Multiple assembly chaperones govern biogenesis of the proteasome regulatory particle base.","type":"article","volume":"137","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-assembly-chaperones-govern-biogenesis-proteasome-regulatory-particle-base"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5435980,"mean":6.3249855700308,"rank":1173000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4229312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5435980,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240115,"mean":4.5902926693156,"rank":45562,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":193401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240115,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8092,"mean":18.212058336423,"rank":3133,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8092,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":462,"mean":15.898603036876,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":462,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
