Genetic, pharmacological, molecular, cytological, and biochemical analyses show that the major underlying mechanism for these phenotypes is excessive MT stabilization manifested in both mutants as heavy MT bundling, disorientation, and drug stability. The above defects in MAPK signaling result in the adverse regulation of members of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP65) protein family, including strongly diminished phosphorylation of MAP65-1. These data suggest that ANP2\/ANP3, MPK4, and the microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1, a putative target of MPK4 signaling, are all essential for the proper organization of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis epidermal cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","authors":["Beck M","Komis G","M\u00fcller J","Menzel D","Samaj J"],"doi":"10.1105\/tpc.109.071746","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:04:56+00:00","issns":["1040-4651","1532-298X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1273190400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20215588","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1105\/tpc.109.071746"],"pmcid":"PMC2861451","pmid":"20215588","pubdate":"2010-03-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Arabidopsis Homologs of Nucleus- and Phragmoplast-Localized Kinase 2 and 3 and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 4 Are Essential for Microtubule Organization","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arabidopsis-homologs-nucleus-phragmoplastlocalized-kinase-2-3-mitogenactivated-protein-kinase-4-esse"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2018148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231923,"mean":3.8970273626481,"rank":99679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231923,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1916,"mean":2.5717524804178,"rank":907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1916,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":2.6186666666667,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
