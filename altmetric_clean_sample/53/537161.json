The unusual structural homology between MIF and certain tautomerases, which includes both a conserved substrate-binding pocket and a catalytic N-terminal proline (Pro1), has fueled speculation that an enzymatic reaction underlies MIF's biologic function. To address the functional role of the MIF tautomerase activity in vivo, we created a knock-in mouse in which the endogenous mif gene was replaced by one encoding a tautomerase-null, Pro1-->Gly1 MIF protein (P1G-MIF). While P1G-MIF is completely inactive catalytically, it maintains significant, albeit reduced, binding to its cell surface receptor (CD74) and to the intracellular binding protein JAB1\/CSN5. P1G-MIF knock-in mice (mif(P1G\/P1G)) and cells derived from these mice show a phenotype in assays of growth control and tumor induction that is intermediate between those of the wild type (mif(+\/+)) and complete MIF deficiency (mif(-)(\/)(-)). These data provide genetic evidence that MIF's intrinsic tautomerase activity is dispensable for this cytokine's growth-regulatory properties and support a role for the N-terminal region in protein-protein interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Fingerle-Rowson G","Kaleswarapu DR","Schlander C","Kabgani N","Brocks T","Reinart N","Busch R","Sch\u00fctz A","Lue H","Du X","Liu A","Xiong H","Chen Y","Nemajerova A","Hallek M","Bernhagen J","Leng L","Bucala R"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.01907-08","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:12:42+00:00","issns":["1098-5549"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1239148800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19188446","http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/29\/7\/1922"],"pmcid":"PMC2655604","pmid":"19188446","pubdate":"2009-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"A Tautomerase-Null Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Gene Knock-In Mouse Model Reveals That Protein Interactions and Not Enzymatic Activity Mediate MIF-Dependent Growth Regulation","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tautomerasenull-macrophage-migrationinhibitory-factor-mif-gene-knockin-mouse-model-reveals-protein-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4448928,"mean":4.7956615416121,"rank":2359292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1376228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4448928,"percentile":30},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234955,"mean":3.9527335904051,"rank":102413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":92180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234955,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3963,"mean":2.2539374053508,"rank":2282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3963,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":1.2257777777778,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
