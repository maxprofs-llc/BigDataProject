Recently, reports have been published that associate preoperative brain injury in neonates with transposition of the great arteries with the performance of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), a procedure that improves systemic oxygenation preoperatively. It is unclear whether BAS is the cause of brain injury or is a confounder, because neonates who require BAS are typically more hypoxemic. We sought to determine the relationship between preoperative brain injury in neonates with transposition of the great arteries and the performance of BAS. We hypothesized that brain injury results from hypoxic injury, not from the BAS itself.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["Petit CJ","Rome JJ","Wernovsky G","Mason SE","Shera DM","Nicolson SC","Montenegro LM","Tabbutt S","Zimmerman RA","Licht DJ"],"doi":"10.1161\/circulationaha.107.760819","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T11:11:21+00:00","issns":["0009-7322","1524-4539"],"issue":"5","journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":1242604800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19171858","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1161\/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.760819"],"pmcid":"PMC2736632","pmid":"19171858","pubdate":"2009-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Preoperative Brain Injury in Transposition of the Great Arteries Is Associated With Oxygenation and Time to Surgery, Not Balloon Atrial Septostomy","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preoperative-brain-injury-transposition-great-arteries-associated-oxygenation-time-surgery-not-ballo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2015187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":947234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231918,"mean":3.9015189572134,"rank":99741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231918,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5617,"mean":7.5011844729345,"rank":3391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5617,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":645,"mean":6.9129099378882,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":645,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
