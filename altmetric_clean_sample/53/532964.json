Here we examine the formation of misfolded protein inclusions in the eukaryotic cytosol of yeast and mammalian cell culture models. We identify two intracellular compartments for the sequestration of misfolded cytosolic proteins. Partition of quality control substrates to either compartment seems to depend on their ubiquitination status and aggregation state. Soluble ubiquitinated misfolded proteins accumulate in a juxtanuclear compartment where proteasomes are concentrated. In contrast, terminally aggregated proteins are sequestered in a perivacuolar inclusion. Notably, disease-associated Huntingtin and prion proteins are preferentially directed to the perivacuolar compartment. Enhancing ubiquitination of a prion protein suffices to promote its delivery to the juxtanuclear inclusion. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the preferential accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins in inclusions linked to human disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008Natur.454.1088K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Kaganovich D","Kopito R","Frydman J","Daniel Kaganovich","Ron Kopito","Judith Frydman"],"doi":"10.1038\/nature07195","endpage":"1095","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:28:05+00:00","issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"issue":"7208","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1391462686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18756251","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v454\/n7208\/pdf\/nature07195.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2746971","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nature07195"],"pmcid":"PMC2746971","pmid":"18756251","pubdate":"2008-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"1088","subjects":["science"],"title":"Misfolded proteins partition between two distinct quality control compartments","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nature07195","volume":"454","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/misfolded-proteins-partition-between-two-distinct-quality-control-compartments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7353748,"mean":6.389009438314,"rank":1401703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5946175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7353748,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246287,"mean":4.8102122572946,"rank":43753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":202211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246287,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45242,"mean":69.204236290091,"rank":28994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":16167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45242,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1001,"mean":56.072528,"rank":728,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1001,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":156,"Student  > Doctoral Student":27,"Student  > Ph.
