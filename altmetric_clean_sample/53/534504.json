We demonstrate that the pharmacological properties of insulin can be enhanced by design of \"zinc staples\" between hexamers. Paired (i, i+4) His substitutions were introduced at an alpha-helical surface. The crystal structure contains both classical axial zinc ions and novel zinc ions at hexamer-hexamer interfaces. Although soluble at pH 4, the combined electrostatic effects of the substitutions and bridging zinc ions cause isoelectric precipitation at neutral pH. Following subcutaneous injection in a diabetic rat, the analog effected glycemic control with a time course similar to that of long acting formulation Lantus. Relative to Lantus, however, the analog discriminates at least 30-fold more stringently between the insulin receptor and mitogenic insulin-like growth factor receptor. Because aberrant mitogenic signaling may be associated with elevated cancer risk, such enhanced specificity may improve safety. Zinc stapling provides a general strategy to modify the pharmacokinetic and biological properties of a subcutaneous protein depot.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Phillips NB","Wan ZL","Whittaker L","Hu SQ","Huang K","Hua QX","Whittaker J","Ismail-Beigi F","Weiss MA"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.c110.105825","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:08:35+00:00","issns":["1083-351X"],"issue":"16","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1271721600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20181952","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.C110.105825"],"pmid":"20181952","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Supramolecular Protein Engineering DESIGN OF ZINC-STAPLED INSULIN HEXAMERS AS A LONG ACTING DEPOT","type":"article","volume":"285","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/supramolecular-protein-engineering-design-zincstapled-insulin-hexamers-long-acting-depot"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2015223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231913,"mean":3.905430309773,"rank":99815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231913,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28043,"mean":2.6371214606661,"rank":19751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":4107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28043,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":1.5477936241611,"rank":380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
