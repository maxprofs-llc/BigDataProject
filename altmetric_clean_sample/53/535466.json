In Drosophila, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are essential for homeostatic turnover of the intestinal epithelium and ensure epithelial regeneration after tissue damage. To accommodate these functions, ISC proliferation is regulated dynamically by various growth factors and stress signaling pathways. How these signals are integrated is poorly understood. Here, we show that EGF receptor signaling is required to maintain the proliferative capacity of ISCs. The EGF ligand Vein is expressed in the muscle surrounding the intestinal epithelium, providing a permissive signal for ISC proliferation. We find that the AP-1 transcription factor FOS serves as a convergence point for this signal and for the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which promotes ISC proliferation in response to stress. Our results support the notion that the visceral muscle serves as a functional 'niche' for ISCs, and identify FOS as a central integrator of a niche-derived permissive signal with stress-induced instructive signals, adjusting ISC proliferation to environmental conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Biteau B","Jasper H","Beno\u00eet Biteau","Heinrich Jasper"],"doi":"10.1242\/dev.056671","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:35:05+00:00","issns":["0950-1991","1477-9129"],"issue":"6","journal":"Development (09501991)","last_mentioned_on":1302220800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21307097","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1242\/dev.056671","http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/lookup\/volpage\/138\/1045?iss=14"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dev.biologists.org\/content\/138\/6\/1045.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3042864","pmid":"21307097","pubdate":"2011-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Company of Biologists Limited","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"EGF signaling regulates the proliferation of intestinal stem cells in Drosophila","type":"article","volume":"138","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/egf-signaling-regulates-proliferation-intestinal-stem-cells-drosophila-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.184,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.184},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8005522,"mean":6.7563037233882,"rank":1262349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6743223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8005522,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249653,"mean":4.996076650698,"rank":37998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":211649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249653,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4014,"mean":6.4706090206828,"rank":1212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4014,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279,"mean":6.7908417266187,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
