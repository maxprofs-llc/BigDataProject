The interleukin-1 (IL-1) system and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are strongly implicated in embryo implantation. The genes coding for IL-1Ra (gene symbol IL-1RN), IL-1beta, MMP2 and MMP9 bear functional polymorphisms. We analysed the maternal genetic profile at these polymorphic sites in IVF patients, to determine possible correlations with IVF outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100072ea","authors":["Gremlich S","Fratta S","Rebellato E","Uras R","Reymondin D","Damnon F","Germond M","Gerber S"],"doi":"10.1093\/humrep\/den034","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:59:51+00:00","issns":["0268-1161","1460-2350"],"issue":"5","journal":"Human Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1213747200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18332090","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/humrep\/den034"],"pmid":"18332090","pubdate":"2008-03-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN) polymorphism is a predictive factor of clinical pregnancy after IVF","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin1-receptor-antagonist-gene-il1rn-polymorphism-predictive-factor-clinical-pregnancy-after"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632582,"mean":4.9236596667819,"rank":2015231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945573,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632582,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231913,"mean":3.9057480337372,"rank":99821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231913,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1649,"mean":5.5195643203883,"rank":925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1649,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":5.2788759124088,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
