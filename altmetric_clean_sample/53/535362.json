In the hematopoietic lineage, Ldb1 forms a complex with the non-DNA-binding adaptor Lmo2 and the transcription factors E2A, Scl and GATA-1 (or GATA-2). Here we demonstrate a critical and continuous requirement for Ldb1 in the maintenance of both fetal and adult mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Deletion of Ldb1 in hematopoietic progenitors resulted in the downregulation of many transcripts required for HSC maintenance. Genome-wide profiling by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified Ldb1 complex-binding sites at highly conserved regions in the promoters of genes involved in HSC maintenance. Our results identify a central role for Ldb1 in regulating the transcriptional program responsible for the maintenance of HSCs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Li L","Jothi R","Cui K","Lee JY","Cohen T","Gorivodsky M","Tzchori I","Zhao Y","Hayes SM","Bresnick EH","Zhao K","Westphal H","Love PE"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.1978","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:32:37+00:00","issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1301443200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21186366","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.1978"],"pmid":"21186366","pubdate":"2010-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Nuclear adaptor Ldb1 regulates a transcriptional program essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nuclear-adaptor-ldb1-regulates-transcriptional-program-essential-maintenance-hematopoietic-stem-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231918,"mean":3.9031247127208,"rank":99778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":91199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231918,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.8477197943445,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.1816551724138,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Ph.
