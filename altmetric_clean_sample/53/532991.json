To examine the nature of the cellular function whose regulation by caspase-8 contributes to its antitumor effect, we assessed the impact of caspase-8 deficiency on cell transformation in vitro. Caspase-8-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts immortalized with the SV40 T antigen did not survive when cultured in soft agar, and were nontumorogenic in nude mice. However, the rate of transformation of these cells during their continuous growth in culture, as reflected in the observed emergence of cells that do grow in soft agar and are able to form tumors in nude mice, was far higher than that of cells expressing caspase-8. These findings indicate that caspase-8 deficiency can contribute to cancer development in a way that does not depend on the enzyme's participation in killing of the tumor cells by host immune cytotoxic mechanisms, or on its involvement in the cell-death process triggered upon detachment of the cells from their substrate, but rather concerns cell-autonomous mechanisms that affect the rate of cell transformation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["Krelin Y","Zhang L","Kang TB","Appel E","Kovalenko A","Wallach D"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2008.88","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T09:28:42+00:00","issns":["1350-9047"," 1476-5403"],"issue":"9","journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1219276800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18566604","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/cdd.2008.88"],"pmid":"18566604","pubdate":"2008-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Caspase-8 deficiency facilitates cellular transformation in vitro","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/caspase8-deficiency-facilitates-cellular-transformation-vitro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":2018509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231872,"mean":3.9462381237845,"rank":100530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231872,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":699,"mean":3.7074699140401,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":699,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.9678181818182,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
