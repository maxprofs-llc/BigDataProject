We report here two kindreds in which otherwise healthy male adults developed X-linked recessive Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) syndromes. These patients had previously unknown mutations in CYBB that resulted in an impaired respiratory burst in monocyte-derived macrophages but not in monocytes or granulocytes. The macrophage-specific functional consequences of the germline mutation resulted from cell-specific impairment in the assembly of the NADPH oxidase. This 'experiment of nature' indicates that CYBB is associated with MSMD and demonstrates that the respiratory burst in human macrophages is a crucial mechanism for protective immunity to tuberculous mycobacteria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Bustamante J","Arias AA","Vogt G","Picard C","Galicia LB","Prando C","Grant AV","Marchal CC","Hubeau M","Chapgier A","de Beaucoudrey L","Puel A","Feinberg J","Valinetz E","Janni\u00e8re L","Besse C","Boland A","Brisseau JM","Blanche S","Lortholary O","Fieschi C","Emile JF","Boisson-Dupuis S","Al-Muhsen S","Woda B","Newburger PE","Condino-Neto A","Dinauer MC","Abel L","Casanova JL"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.1992","first_seen_on":"2011-12-31T10:34:41+00:00","funders":["niaid","nhlbi"],"issns":["1529-2908","1529-2916"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1297209600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21278736","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.1992"],"pmid":"21278736","pubdate":"2011-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Germline CYBB mutations that selectively affect macrophages in kindreds with X-linked predisposition to tuberculous mycobacterial disease","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/germline-cybb-mutations-selectively-affect-macrophages-kindreds-xlinked-predisposition-tuberculous-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2017789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":231888,"mean":3.9389639867696,"rank":100397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":89983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":231888,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.8561208226221,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.1975862068966,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
