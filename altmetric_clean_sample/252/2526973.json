Presenting clinical signs in 6 Holstein beef cattle with such poisoning were primarily dysfunction of the central nervous system and included ataxia, opisthotonus, nystagmus, depression, muscle twitching and intermittent convulsions, as well as abdominal pain and polydipsia. Diarrhea occurred in 2, and blindness in 3\/6 cattle. Hypernatremia (161.8 - 178.8 mmol\/L) and hyperosmolality (331.81 - 366.18 mOsm\/L) were present in all animals. To treat the affected cattle, access to fresh water was restricted, vascular volume was expanded with isotonic saline and then hypotonic fluid (5% Dextrose solution) i.v. and dexamethasone im was administered. Although biochemical parameters returned to normal reference ranges, 3\/6 affected animals remained blind.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d26f","authors":["Senturk S","Huseyin C"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-21T20:48:49+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Veterinary and human toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1405976718,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14748413"],"pmid":"14748413","pubdate":"2004-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Salt poisoning in beef cattle.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salt-poisoning-beef-cattle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4048000,"mean":5.061784280402,"rank":1834805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2155619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4048000,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101283,"mean":7.9112698603898,"rank":40416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":58886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101283,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.4800487804878,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Ph.D. Student":1,"Student (Master)":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VetPracticeVAHS\/status\/491323681570693120","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2526973],"posted_on":"2014-07-21T20:47:48+00:00","author":{"name":"VAHS (Cody Creelman)","url":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/vetpracticevahs","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/524425107348148224\/r4ut93eM_normal.jpeg","description":"Beef Cattle Veterinarian at Veterinary Agri-Health Services.
