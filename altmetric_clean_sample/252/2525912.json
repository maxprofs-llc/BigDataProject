Here we describe a woman admitted to the dermatology ward with NME which was later found to be associated with glucagonoma, a slow-growing, rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Even more rarely, the tumor was located in the pancreas head, while most of such lesions are located in the distal pancreas. The diagnosis of this rare tumor requires an elevated serum glucagon level and imaging confirming a pancreatic tumor. After surgical removal of the tumor, the patient's cutaneous and systemic features resolved. It is therefore imperative that clinicians recognize NME early in order to make an accurate diagnosis and to provide treatment for this rare tumor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b8","doi":"10.1186\/1477-7819-12-220","first_seen_on":"2014-07-21T13:00:48+00:00","issns":["1477-7819"],"issue":"1","journal":"World Journal of Surgical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1405947605,"links":["http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/12\/1\/220\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.wjso.com\/content\/pdf\/1477-7819-12-220.pdf","pmid":"25029913","pubdate":"2014-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["neoplasms","generalsurgery"],"title":"Necrolytic migratory erythema as the first manifestation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/necrolytic-migratory-erythema-first-manifestation-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4048000,"mean":5.061784280402,"rank":3237318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":100719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4048000,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101282,"mean":7.9113455040926,"rank":80598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":980,"mean":1.7409540347293,"rank":883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":2.4663793103448,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/memoalexlope\/status\/491205976880467969","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2525912],"posted_on":"2014-07-21T13:00:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Guillermo Lopez C","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1511285875\/45150_485611673153_796953153_6804721_3991610_n_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico Anatomopatologo.
