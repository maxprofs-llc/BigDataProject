A previous method by Whitlock and Guillaume derived a simulation resampling approach to statistically test for a difference between QST and FST , but that method is limited to balanced data sets with offspring related as half-sibs through shared fathers. We extend this approach to (1) allow for a model more suitable for some plant populations or breeding designs in which offspring are related through mothers (assuming independent fathers for each offspring; half-sibs by dam), and (2) by explicitly allowing for unbalanced data sets. The resulting approach is made available through the R package QstFstComp. This article is protected by copyright.
