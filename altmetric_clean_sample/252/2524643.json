Under non-rotor-synchronized conditions the rCW decoupling sequences provide more efficient decoupling, are easier to setup, and prove more robust towards experimental parameters such as radio frequency (rf) field amplitude and spinning frequency. This is demonstrated through numerical simulations substantiated with experimental results under different sample spinning and rf field amplitude conditions for powder samples of U-(13)C-glycine and U-(13)C-L-histidine\u00b7HCl\u00b7H2O.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e26","doi":"10.1016\/j.jmr.2014.07.006","first_seen_on":"2014-07-20T23:52:52+00:00","issns":["10907807"],"journal":"Journal of Magnetic Resonance","last_mentioned_on":1405900335,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090780714001979"],"pmid":"25123538","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Efficient heteronuclear decoupling in MAS solid-state NMR using non-rotor-synchronized rCW irradiation ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-heteronuclear-decoupling-mas-solidstate-nmr-using-nonrotorsynchronized-rcw-irradiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":3544865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":840149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126630,"mean":8.2613564507344,"rank":84171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":25008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126630,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":1.450305,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
