Although FR-targeted therapies aimed at eliminating activated macrophages have shown promise for treating inflammatory diseases, little work has been performed to evaluate whether other hematopoietic cells might also express FR-\u03b2. Analysis of peripheral blood cells with a mAb to human FR-\u03b2 reveals that only monocytes express FR-\u03b2. Molecular characterization of these circulating monocytes further demonstrates that solely the classic\/proinflammatory subset (CD14(high)CD16(-)) expresses the FR and that only CD14(high)CD16(-) FR-\u03b2(+) monocytes also display the ability to bind folate-linked molecules. Confirmation that this subset of monocytes indeed constitutes the proinflammatory subpopulation was obtained by demonstrating coexpression of FR-\u03b2 with other proinflammatory markers, including CCR2 and HLA-DR. Synovial monocytes from the joints of patients with RA were also shown to express FR-\u03b2. As inhibition of the chemotaxis of proinflammatory monocytes into sites of inflammation has been explored frequently as a means of controlling autoimmune diseases, demonstration that FR-\u03b2 is uniquely expressed on this proinflammatory subpopulation offers a new strategy to suppress migration of inflammatory monocytes into sites of inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["Jiayin Shen","Andrew R.
