These disorders are associated with Tau accumulation. We have previously shown that Cerebrolysin\u2122 (CBL), a neuropeptide mixture with neurotrophic effects, ameliorates the behavioral deficits and neuropathological alterations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD by reducing hyper-phosphorylated Tau. CBL has been tested in clinical trials for AD, however it's potential beneficial effects in FTLD are unknown. For this purpose we sought to investigate the effects of CBL in a tg model of tauopathy. Accordingly, double tg mice expressing mutant Tau under the mThy-1 promoter and GSK3\u03b2 (to enhance Tau phosphorylation) were treated with CBL and evaluated neuropathologically.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","authors":["Rockenstein E","Ubhi K","Trejo M","Mante M","Patrick C","Adame A","Novak P","Jech M","Doppler E","Moessler H","Masliah E"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2202-15-90","first_seen_on":"2014-07-21T22:24:38+00:00","issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1442217818,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2202\/15\/90\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25047000?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/25047000\/?i=23&from=cerebrolysin"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2202-15-90.pdf","pmid":"25047000","pubdate":"2014-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"CerebrolysinTM efficacy in a transgenic model of tauopathy: role in regulation of mitochondrial structure.","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cerebrolysin-efficacy-transgenic-model-tauopathy-role-regulation-mitochondrial-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421960,"mean":7.0860234078473,"rank":3557284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4810899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421960,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181526,"mean":7.6945999724558,"rank":59813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":120170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181526,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":845,"mean":3.6401706161137,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":845,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":4.4946875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"CerebrolysinTM efficacy in a transgenic model of tauopathy: role in regulation of mitochondrial...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/159234397468230\/posts\/727217620669902","license":"public","citation_ids":[2527091],"posted_on":"2014-07-21T22:23:46+00:00","summary":"New article from BMC Neuroscience -
