The most common types of chronic daily headache are chronic migraines and chronic tension-type headaches. If a red flag for a secondary cause of headache is present, magnetic resonance imaging of the head should be performed. All patients should be asked about medication overuse, which can increase the frequency of headaches. Patients who overuse medications for abortive therapy for headache should be encouraged to stop the medications entirely and consider prophylactic treatment. Several prophylactic treatments for chronic daily headache can reduce headache frequency and severity, as well as improve overall quality of life. Nonpharmacologic treatments include relaxation techniques, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, osteopathic manipulation, and cervical exercises. Pharmacologic therapies include amitriptyline, gabapentin, onabotulinumtoxinA, propranolol, tizanidine, topiramate, and valproate.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056f9","authors":["Yancey JR","Sheridan R","Koren KG"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-19T19:08:03+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"American Family Physician","last_mentioned_on":1410271200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24784123?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24784123"],"pmid":"24784123","pubdate":"2014-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Chronic daily headache: diagnosis and management.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-daily-headache-diagnosis-management-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.536,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.536},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":356684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4150917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109840,"mean":7.9359735977205,"rank":11960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":97880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109840,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":935,"mean":2.9115631691649,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":935,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.0909523809524,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/_familymedicine\/status\/490573667672141826","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2523177],"posted_on":"2014-07-19T19:07:31+00:00","author":{"name":"IMA Family Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/familymedicineupdate","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3225607495\/e1c280284532b6b18eb2406267d89cf0_normal.png","description":"Family medicine news and information from the Internet Medical Association","id_on_source":"_familymedicine","tweeter_id":"83873868","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7092},"tweet_id":"490573667672141826"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Chronic Daily Headache: What is the cause?
