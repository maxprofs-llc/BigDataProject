These patients have low pain thresholds, and the use of opioids can be especially harmful. Intraoperative nervous fiber section and the high temperatures of electrical scalpels probably contribute to the generation of postoperative neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that an antineuropathic pain drug like pregabalin could be helpful to optimize postoperative analgesia by reducing the requirement for opioids and their associated side effects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Cabrera Schulmeyer MC","de la Maza J","Ovalle C","Farias C","Vives I"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-009-9944-1","first_seen_on":"2014-07-20T14:19:53+00:00","issns":["0960-8923"],"issue":"12","journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1405865911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19727980"],"pmid":"19727980","pubdate":"2009-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Analgesic effects of a single preoperative dose of pregabalin after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analgesic-effects-single-preoperative-dose-pregabalin-after-laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3055874,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109906,"mean":7.9935072289707,"rank":72877,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109906,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1218,"mean":2.1280016433854,"rank":681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1218,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":0.99714285714286,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
