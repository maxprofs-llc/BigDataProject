As urine accumulates all types of changes, identifying the precise cause of changes in the urine proteome is challenging and crucial in biomarker discovery. To reduce the effects of both genetic and environmental factors on the urinary proteome, this study used a rat model of adriamycin-induced nephropathy resembling human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000079c","doi":"10.1186\/1477-5956-12-42","first_seen_on":"2014-07-21T05:49:48+00:00","issns":["1477-5956"],"issue":"1","journal":"Proteome Science","last_mentioned_on":1405921770,"links":["http:\/\/www.proteomesci.com\/content\/12\/1\/42\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.proteomesci.com\/content\/pdf\/1477-5956-12-42.pdf","pmid":"25061428","pubdate":"2014-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"42","title":"Dynamic changes of urinary proteins in a focal segmental glomerulosclerosis rat model","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-changes-urinary-proteins-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-rat-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3039075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109921,"mean":8.0557761644836,"rank":72000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109921,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":2.1635061728395,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.15,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/7Journals\/status\/491097614410989568","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2525211],"posted_on":"2014-07-21T05:49:30+00:00","author":{"name":"7Journals","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/323301047\/7journals-com_normal.jpg","description":"Online Edition of the #Journals and #Commentary","id_on_source":"7Journals","tweeter_id":"58580755","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":264},"tweet_id":"491097614410989568"}]}}
