We chose two protein-ligand systems, the levansucrase-sugar (glucose or sucrose), and LinB-1,2-dichloroethane systems, as target systems that differ in terms of the size and shape of the ligand-binding pocket and the physicochemical properties of the pocket and the ligand. Spatial distributions of the Coarse-grained (CG) ligand molecules revealed potential ligand-binding sites on the protein surfaces other than the real ligand-binding sites. The ligands bound most strongly to the real ligand-binding sites. The binding and unbinding rate constants obtained from the CGMD simulation of the levansucrase-sucrose system were approximately 10 times greater than the experimental values; this is mainly due to faster diffusion of the CG ligand in the CG water model. We could obtain dissociation constants close to the experimental values for both systems. Analysis of the ligand fluxes demonstrated that the CG ligand molecules entered the ligand-binding pockets through specific pathways. The ligands tended to move through grooves on the protein surface. Thus, the CGMD simulations produced reasonable results for the two different systems overall and are useful for studying the protein-ligand binding processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fa6","authors":["Negami, Tatsuki","Shimizu, Kentaro","Terada, Tohru"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcc.23693","endpage":"1845","first_seen_on":"2014-07-21T04:47:49+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1096-987X","0192-8651"],"issue":"25","journal":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1405926075,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.23693\/abstract;jsessionid=05BCD3771A6760BCC98C234A0CA24F5C.f04t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcc.23693\/pdf","pmid":"25043724","pubdate":"2014-07-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
