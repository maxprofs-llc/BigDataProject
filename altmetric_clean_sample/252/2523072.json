Despite the devastating nature of this disease, which results in\u2009>\u200997% mortality, knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of the amoeba is incomplete. This work presents a comparative proteomic approach based on an experimental model in which the pathogenic potential of N. fowleri trophozoites is influenced by the compositions of different media.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Denise C Zysset-Burri","Norbert M\u00fcller","Christian Beuret","Manfred Heller","Nadia Sch\u00fcrch","Bruno Gottstein","Matthias Wittwer"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-15-496","first_seen_on":"2014-07-19T17:18:32+00:00","issns":["1471-2164",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1407496071,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1186\/1471-2164-15-496","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4082629\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2F1471-2164-15-496.pdf","pmid":"24950717","pubdate":"2014-06-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Genome-wide identification of pathogenicity factors of the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-identification-pathogenicity-factors-freeliving-amoeba-naegleria-fowleri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505777,"mean":5.1029644735862,"rank":145396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4360132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505777,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109824,"mean":7.8969631497957,"rank":6247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":103564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109824,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.2908550583658,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280,"mean":3.2278996415771,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
