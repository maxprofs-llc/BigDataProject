We investigated whether V\u02d9O2pk and systemic responses measured during field walking tests were similar to those measured during an incremental treadmill (ITM) test in obese individuals with treated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). METHODS Individuals with treated OSA and a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 kg\u00b7m-2 were recruited. Participants completed an ITM, two six-minute walk tests (6MWT) and two incremental shuttle walk tests (ISWT) on three separate days in a randomised order. Expired gas analysis was performed during all tests. RESULTS 16 patients (9 male) completed the study (mean [SD] age 58 [12] y, BMI 36.1 [7.6] kg\u00b7m-2). There was no difference (p=0.27) in V\u02d9O2pk assessed by the ITM and the ISWT (2266 [478] and 2017 [561] ml\u00b7min-1, respectively). The V\u02d9O2pk measured by the 6MWT (1778 [360] ml\u00b7min-1) was lower than that measured by the ITM (p &lt;0.01). The limits of agreement for V\u02d9O2pk between the ISWT and the ITM were \u00b1730 ml\u00b7min-1. Cardio-respiratory responses during the ISWT and the ITM reflected a graded response to a peak whereas the 6MWT demonstrated a rapid rise to a plateau. CONCLUSION The ISWT can be used, instead of an ITM and in preference to the 6MWT, to assess cardio-respiratory fitness for a cohort of obese people with treated OSA. However, the imprecision of the agreement in V\u02d9O2pk between the ITM and ISWT means they cannot be used interchangeably in an individual.
