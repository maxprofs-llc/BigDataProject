At the end of the treatment period, the ultrastructure of the ovarian granulosa cells was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The apoptotic cell death of ovarian granulosa cells was detected using TUNEL staining. The mRNA expression levels of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bcl2, Bax, and Fas were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. The protein expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl2, Bax, and Fas were determined by western blotting. Our data showed that exposure to SIFs resulted in morphological changes consistent with ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis. The percentage of TUNEL-positive granulosa cells was increased. The mRNA expression levels of the apoptosis-related genes caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, Bax, and Fas increased significantly. The protein levels of Bax, Fas, and cleaved caspase-3 were also increased. These results indicate that the exposure of rats to modest doses of SIFs from weaning until sexual maturity can affect ovarian follicle development by inducing apoptosis. The mechanism of SIF-induced alterations in ovarian follicle development may involve the activation of Fas-mediated and Bcl2\/Bax-mediated apoptotic signaling pathways.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Wang W","Sun Y","Liu J","Li Y","Li H","Xiao S","Weng S","Zhang W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2014.07.010","first_seen_on":"2014-07-22T15:57:34+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1406044550,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25035168?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25035168","pubdate":"2014-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Soy isoflavones administered to rats from weaning until sexual maturity affect ovarian follicle development by inducing apoptosis.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soy-isoflavones-administered-rats-weaning-until-sexual-maturity-affect-ovarian-follicle-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3055566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110012,"mean":7.997180500132,"rank":72948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110012,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1377,"mean":6.5681875,"rank":925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1377,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.20648,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
