Using the yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that neurexin 1 interacted with multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (MUPP1) through PDZ domain. Neurexin 2 and 3 also interacted with MUPP1. MUPP1 and neurexin 1 were co-localized in cultured cells. These results suggest a novel mechanism for localizing neurexin 1 to synaptic sites.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c94","authors":["Won Hee Jang","Sun Hee Choi","Joo Young Jeong","Jung-Hwa Park","Sang-Jin Kim","Dae-Hyun Seog"],"doi":"10.1080\/09168451.2014.890031","first_seen_on":"2014-07-19T10:38:51+00:00","issns":["1347-6947"],"issue":"4","journal":"Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1405766245,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25036961?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25036961","pubdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Neuronal cell-surface protein neurexin 1 interaction with multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neuronal-cellsurface-protein-neurexin-1-interaction-multipdz-domain-protein-mupp1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4040629,"mean":5.0584274803895,"rank":3230745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":100441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4040629,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101101,"mean":7.8625546785361,"rank":80429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101101,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":724,"mean":2.4627662517289,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":724,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":2.1538333333333,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
