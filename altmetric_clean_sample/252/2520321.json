Our recent genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain demonstrated that an increase in endogenous MeOH after ADH inhibition led to a significant increase in the plasma MeOH concentration and a modification of mRNA synthesis. These findings suggest endogenous MeOH involvement in homeostasis regulation by controlling mRNA levels. Here, we demonstrate directly that study volunteers displayed increasing concentrations of MeOH and FA in their blood plasma when consuming citrus pectin, ethanol and red wine. A microarray analysis of white blood cells (WBC) from volunteers after pectin intake showed various responses for 30 significantly differentially regulated mRNAs, most of which were somehow involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There was also a decreased synthesis of hemoglobin mRNA, HBA and HBB, the presence of which in WBC RNA was not a result of red blood cells contamination because erythrocyte-specific marker genes were not significantly expressed. A qRT-PCR analysis of volunteer WBCs after pectin and red wine intake confirmed the complicated relationship between the plasma MeOH content and the mRNA accumulation of both genes that were previously identified, namely, GAPDH and SNX27, and genes revealed in this study, including MME, SORL1, DDIT4, HBA and HBB. We hypothesized that human plasma MeOH has an impact on the WBC mRNA levels of genes involved in cell signaling.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Anastasia V Shindyapina","Igor V Petrunia","Tatiana V Komarova","Ekaterina V Sheshukova","Vyacheslav S Kosorukov","Gleb I Kiryanov","Yuri L Dorokhov"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0102837","first_seen_on":"2014-07-18T13:00:53+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1405688392,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25033451?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25033451","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Dietary Methanol Regulates Human Gene Activity.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-methanol-regulates-human-gene-activity-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3056048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109629,"mean":7.9150685043969,"rank":72685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":26201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109629,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.4059968514564,"rank":55862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":15250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2288,"mean":15.368480979449,"rank":1770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2288,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
