The inner layer was composed of PLLA microfiber containing 25% elastin-laminin mimetic protein (AG73-(VPGIG)30) that promotes neurite outgrowth. The thickest middle layer was constructed of pure PLLA microfibers that impart the large mechanical strength to the conduit. A 10% poly(ethylene glycol) was added to the outer layer to prevent the adhesion with the surrounding tissue. The AG73-(VPGIG)30 compositing of an elastin-like repetitive sequence (VPGIG)30 and a laminin-derived sequence (RKRLQVQLSIRT: AG73) was biosynthesized using Escherichia coli. The PLLA microfibrous conduits were fabricated using an electrospinning procedure. AG73-(VPGIG)30 was successfully mixed in the PLLA microfibers, and the PLLA\/AG73-(VPGIG)30 microfibers were stable under physiological conditions. The PLLA\/AG73-(VPGIG)30 microfibers enhanced adhesion and neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. The electrospun microfibrous conduit with a three-layered structure was implanted for bridging a 2.0-cm gap in the tibial nerve of a rabbit. Two months after implantation, no adhesion of surrounding tissue was observed, and the action potential was slightly improved in the nerve conduit with the PLLA\/AG73-(VPGIG)30 inner layer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456a","authors":["Kakinoki, Sachiro","Nakayama, Midori","Moritan, Toshiyuki","Yamaoka, Tetsuji"],"doi":"10.3389\/fchem.2014.00052","first_seen_on":"2014-07-18T11:41:58+00:00","issns":["","2296-2646"],"journal":"Frontiers in Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1405683696,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fchem.2014.00052\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/10.3389\/fchem.2014.00052\/pdf","pmid":"25101261","pubdate":"2014-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Three-layer microfibrous peripheral nerve guide conduit composed of elastin-laminin mimetic artificial protein and poly(L-lactic acid)","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threelayer-microfibrous-peripheral-nerve-guide-conduit-composed-elastinlaminin-mimetic-artificial-pr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
