We built up a composite antifungal system by a simple pre-treating and assembling procedure for investigating synergy. Investigations showed 0.25\u2005g\/L ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with 0.01\u2005g\/L thiram could inhibit the fungal growth in a synergistic mode. More importantly, the 0.25\u2005g\/L ZnO NPs completely degraded 0.01\u2005g\/L thiram under simulated sunlight irradiation within 6\u2005hours. It was demonstrated that the formation of ZnO-thiram antifungal system, electrostatic adsorption of ZnO NPs to fungi cells and the cellular internalization of ZnO-thiram composites played important roles in synergy. Oxidative stress test indicated ZnO-induced oxidative damage was enhanced by thiram that finally result in synergistic antifungal effect. By reducing the pesticides usage, this nanotechnology could control the plant disease economically, more significantly, the following photocatalytic degradation of pesticide greatly benefit the human social by avoiding negative influence of pesticide residue on public health and environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Jingzhe Xue","Zhihui Luo","Ping Li","Yaping Ding","Yi Cui","Qingsheng Wu"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep05408","first_seen_on":"2014-07-20T23:27:31+00:00","issns":["","2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1405379964,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/srep05408?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+srep%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Scientific+Reports%29"],"pmcid":"PMC4097348","pmid":"25023938","pubdate":"2014-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nanoparticles","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Mechanism of action","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A residue-free green synergistic antifungal nanotechnology for pesticide thiram by ZnO nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/residuefree-green-synergistic-antifungal-nanotechnology-pesticide-thiram-zno-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5222019,"mean":6.1569969054133,"rank":2767596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1774283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5222019,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130012,"mean":8.3394226950028,"rank":64947,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":49535,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130012,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17395,"mean":13.55340761182,"rank":10106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17395,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":670,"mean":13.060056801196,"rank":407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":670,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
