The pain may be acute as a result of trauma or chronic from repetitive stress. Pathology of the os trigonum-talar process is the most common cause of this syndrome, but it also may result from flexor hallucis longus tenosynovitis, ankle osteochondritis, subtalar joint disease, and fracture. Patients usually report chronic or recurrent posterior ankle pain caused or exacerbated by forced plantar flexion or push-off maneuvers, such as may occur during dancing, kicking, or downhill running. Diagnosis of posterior ankle impingement syndrome is based primarily on clinical history and physical examination. Radiography, scintigraphy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging depict associated bone and soft-tissue abnormalities. Symptoms typically improve with nonsurgical management, but surgery may be required in refractory cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8e","authors":["Maquirriain J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-19T20:32:09+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons","last_mentioned_on":1458055434,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16224109"],"pmid":"16224109","pubdate":"2005-10-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","generalsurgery"],"title":"Posterior ankle impingement syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/posterior-ankle-impingement-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7396084,"mean":6.428716941112,"rank":5335853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1800942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7396084,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197840,"mean":9.194461476251,"rank":126138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":60124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197840,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":430,"mean":10.73627972028,"rank":330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":430,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":6.975,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
