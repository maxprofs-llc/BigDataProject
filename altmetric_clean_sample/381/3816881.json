Marine core sediments were collected and the measurements were performed using the high resolution gamma-ray spectrometry method. The vertical distribution of (137)Cs activity concentration, as part of anthropogenic marine radioactivity, provided averaged sedimentation rate by identifying the depths of activity concentrations due to the Chernobyl accident and the nuclear tests signals. Furthermore, (137)Cs measurements were reproduced using the proposed one-dimensional diffusion-advection model which provides mainly as an output, the sedimentation rate and the average diffusivity of (137)Cs in the sediment column. The proposed model estimates the temporal variation of (137)Cs activity concentration from 1987 (one year after the Chernobyl accident) till today (2014).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f13cf058f610002d89","doi":"10.1016\/j.jenvrad.2015.02.009","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T11:42:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0265931X"],"journal":"Journal of Environmental Radioactivity","last_mentioned_on":1426978623,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0265931X15000363"],"pmid":"25771157","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Vertical distribution of 137Cs activity concentration in marine sediments at Amvrakikos Gulf, western of Greece ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vertical-distribution-137cs-activity-concentration-marine-sediments-amvrakikos-gulf-western-greece"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4897807,"mean":5.8216879933617,"rank":4096625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4897807,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145282,"mean":10.223837748914,"rank":121285,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145282,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":7.2180429184549,"rank":413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.9166666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
