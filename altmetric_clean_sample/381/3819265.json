Because of this weakness, a bigger proportion of the drug-loaded nanomaterials flow toward healthy tissues and result in undesirable side effects. It is very important to evaluate drug loading and release efficiency of various nanomaterials to find out true pharmacokinetics of these drugs.This observational study aims to evaluate various surface functionalized and naked nanomaterials for their drug loading capability and consequently strengthens the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). We analyzed naked and coated nanoparticles of transition metal oxides for their further loading with doxorubicin, a representative water-soluble anticancer drug.Various uncoated and polyethylene glycol-coated metal oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and loaded with anticancer drug using simple stirring of the nanoparticles in a saturated aqueous solution of the drug. Results showed that surface-coated nanoparticles have higher drug-loading capabilities; however, certain naked metal oxide nanoparticles, such as cobalt oxide nanoparticles, can load a sufficient amount of drug.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Javed KR","Ahmad M","Ali S","Butt MZ","Nafees M","Butt AR","Nadeem M","Shahid A"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000000617","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T14:38:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"11","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1427872630,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25789952?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/03030\/Comparison_of_Doxorubicin_Anticancer_Drug_Loading.11.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/md-journal\/Fulltext\/2015\/03030\/Comparison_of_Doxorubicin_Anticancer_Drug_Loading.11.aspx?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pmid":"25789952","pubdate":"2015-03-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Comparison of Doxorubicin Anticancer Drug Loading on Different Metal Oxide Nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-doxorubicin-anticancer-drug-loading-different-metal-oxide-nanoparticles-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6424456,"mean":5.8877269922497,"rank":4509235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1677652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6424456,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160705,"mean":10.276109393668,"rank":108499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":44649,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160705,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3161,"mean":2.2571341772152,"rank":1404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3161,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":4.9261403508772,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":86,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
