KOOLV was shown previously to be related antigenically to kotonkon virus, an ephemerovirus that has caused an ephemeral fever-like illness in cattle in Nigeria, but YATV failed to react antigenically with any other virus tested. Here we report the complete genome sequences of KOOLV (16,133 nt) and YATV (14,479 nt). Each has a complex genome organisation, with multiple genes, including a second non-structural glycoprotein (GNS) gene and a viroporin (\u03b11) gene, between the G and L genes as is characteristic of ephemeroviruses. Based on an analysis of genome organisation, sequence identity and cross-neutralisation, we demonstrate that both KOOLV and YATV should be classified as two new species in the genus Ephemerovirus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["Blasdell KR","Widen SG","Diviney SM","Firth C","Wood TG","Guzman H","Holmes EC","Tesh RB","Vasilakis N","Walker PJ"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetmic.2014.09.031","first_seen_on":"2015-03-20T08:11:30+00:00","funders":["phs","niaid"],"issns":[],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1426841137,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25457369"],"pmid":"25457369","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Koolpinyah and Yata viruses: Two newly recognised ephemeroviruses from tropical regions of Australia and Africa.","type":"article","volume":"174","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/koolpinyah-yata-viruses-two-newly-recognised-ephemeroviruses-tropical-regions-australia-africa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4895294,"mean":5.8210093540908,"rank":2379155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2468093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4895294,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145704,"mean":10.1735745043,"rank":74624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":69664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145704,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":998,"mean":1.8248766298897,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":998,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.355,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
