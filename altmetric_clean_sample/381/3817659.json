This makes it difficult to assess the quality of a body of research that addresses the same or a similar research question but using different approaches. The aim of this paper is to describe the development and preliminary evaluation of a quality assessment tool that can be applied to a methodologically diverse set of research articles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f33cf058f610002d91","authors":["Sirriyeh R","Lawton R","Gardner P","Armitage G","Sirriyeh, Reema","Lawton, Rebecca","Gardner, Peter","Armitage, Gerry"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2011.01662.x","endpage":"752","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T12:40:26+00:00","issns":["1365-2753"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice","last_mentioned_on":1477630800,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2011.01662.x\/abstract;jsessionid=0E69885713281864B27ED36BBB84D8E7.f01t04","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21410846"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2753.2011.01662.x\/pdf","pmid":"21410846","pubdate":"2012-08-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"746","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Reviewing studies with diverse designs: the development and evaluation of a new tool","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reviewing-studies-diverse-designs-development-evaluation-new-tool"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.25,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7607694,"mean":6.5509374902442,"rank":1338569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6262319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7607694,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198675,"mean":9.2159498374223,"rank":45286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":153141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198675,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":665,"mean":6.774921686747,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":665,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":7.4563,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Student  > Ph.
