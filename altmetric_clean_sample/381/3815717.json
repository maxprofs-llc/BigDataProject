CAs in the brain play a central role in versatile functions as slow-acting neurotransmitters functioning in synaptic neurotransmission, modulating the effects of fast-acting neurotransmitters such as glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In this review, I focus on recent advances in the biochemistry and molecular biology of the CA system in humans in health and disease, especially in neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), in relation to the biosynthesis of CAs regulated by a pteridine-dependent monooxygenase, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH) and its pteridine cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008604","authors":["Toshiharu Nagatsu"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T10:46:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0386-2208"],"issue":"10","journal":"Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B: Physical and Biological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1427021164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25792770?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4338835","pmid":"25792770","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","physiology"],"title":"The catecholamine system in health and disease -Relation to tyrosine 3-monooxygenase and other catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes.","type":"article","volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catecholamine-system-health-disease-relation-tyrosine-3monooxygenase-other-catecholaminesynthesizing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4901725,"mean":5.8260192838313,"rank":2600579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1639012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4901725,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145295,"mean":10.225843420926,"rank":83316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145295,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":32.002404255319,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
