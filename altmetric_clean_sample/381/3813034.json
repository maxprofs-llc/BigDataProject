Here we investigated the receptor usage and cell entry of PEDV. PEDV recognizes protein receptor aminopeptidase N from pig and human, and sugar co-receptor N-acetylneuraminic acid. Moreover, PEDV infects cells from pig, human, monkey, and bat. These results support bats as an evolutionary origin for PEDV, implicate PEDV as a potential threat to other species, and suggest antiviral strategies to control its spread.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["Chang Liu","Jian Tang","Yuanmei Ma","Xueya Liang","Yang Yang","Guiqing Peng","Qianqian Qi","Shibo Jiang","Jianrong Li","Lanying Du","Fang Li"],"doi":"10.1128\/jvi.00430-15","first_seen_on":"2015-03-20T10:08:04+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1098-5514"],"journal":"Journal of Virology","last_mentioned_on":1432046370,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25787280?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/89\/11\/6121.abstract?etoc="],"pmid":"25787280","pubdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Receptor Usage and Cell Entry of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Coronavirus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/receptor-usage-cell-entry-porcine-epidemic-diarrhea-coronavirus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5119801,"mean":6.0594419789855,"rank":3381373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1524492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5119801,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150856,"mean":10.26479484273,"rank":101551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":42139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150856,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5417,"mean":3.5002171344165,"rank":3777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5417,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":5.0230839694656,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
