Outcomes included acute CHD and CHD or revascularization. We estimated race-stratified multivariate Cox proportional hazards models of incident CHD and incident CHD or revascularization with the 4-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, adjusting for risk factors.\nMean follow-up was 4.2 \u00b1 1.5\u00a0years; CHD incidence was 8.3 events per 1000 person-years (n\u00a0=\u00a0366) among blacks and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years (n\u00a0=\u00a0613) among whites. After adjustment for age, sex, marital status, region, and socioeconomic status, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with incident CHD among blacks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.91) but not among whites (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.74-1.64). In the fully adjusted model, compared with blacks who reported no depressive symptoms, those reporting depressive symptoms had greater risk for the composite end point of CHD or revascularization (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.81). Depressive symptoms were not associated with incident CHD end points among whites.\nHigh depressive symptoms were associated with higher risk of CHD or revascularization for blacks but not whites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002276","authors":["Sims, Mario","Redmond, Nicole","Khodneva, Yulia","Durant, Raegan W","Halanych, Jewell","Safford, Monika M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annepidem.2015.03.014","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T11:21:54+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1047-2797","1873-2585"],"journal":"Annals of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1427023257,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=7&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.annalsofepidemiology.org%2Farticle%2FS1047-2797%252815%252900124-6%2Fabstract&code=aep-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annalsofepidemiology.org\/article\/S1047279715001246\/pdf","pmid":"25891100","pubdate":"2015-04-22T22:07:46+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Depressive symptoms are associated with incident coronary heart disease or revascularization among Blacks but not among Whites in the Reasons for Geographical and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depressive-symptoms-associated-incident-coronary-heart-disease-revascularization-among-blacks-not-am-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5044136,"mean":5.9751342951787,"rank":3540250,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":848353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5044136,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148500,"mean":10.279070593068,"rank":106996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148500,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":643,"mean":6.0043582554517,"rank":459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":643,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":10.504111111111,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
