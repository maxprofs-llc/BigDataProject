The complete nucleotide sequence analysis of the virus revealed that the virus consists of 5,704 bp with two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 (3,084 nt) encodes a putative capsid protein. ORF2 (1,977 nt) encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 could be translated as a fusion with the ORF1 product by a -1 frameshift in the overlapping ORF1. Phylogenetic analyses based on the RdRp revealed that the virus from C. yamaokai is most likely a novel totivirus, but it is not closely related to the previously known totiviruses in arthropods. Transmission electron microscopy revealed isometric virus particles of approximately 30 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm, which is consistent with the characteristics of the family Totiviridae. The virus was detected by RT-PCR in all caste members and developmental stages of ants, including eggs, larvae, pupae, adult workers, alates (male and female) and queens. This study is the first report of a totivirus in a hymenopteran, and the virus was designated as Camponotus yamaokai virus (CYV).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9c","authors":["Satoshi Koyama","Syun-Ichi Urayama","Tsutomu Ohmatsu","Yukiko Sassa","Chihiro Sakai","Mamoru Takata","Shinya Hayashi","Makoto Nagai","Tetsuya Furuya","Hiromitsu Moriyama","Toshiyuki Satoh","Shin-Ichi Ono","Testuya Mizutani"],"doi":"10.1099\/vir.0.000126","first_seen_on":"2015-03-20T12:49:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-2099"],"journal":"Journal of General Virology","last_mentioned_on":1426855744,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25787938?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25787938","pubdate":"2015-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Identification, characterization, and full-length sequence analysis of a novel double-stranded RNA virus isolated from an arboreal ant, Camponotus yamaokai.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-characterization-fulllength-sequence-analysis-novel-dsrna-virus-isolated-arboreal-ant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4895294,"mean":5.8210093540908,"rank":4094741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4895294,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145706,"mean":10.173462310834,"rank":121489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145706,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1112,"mean":2.8860684068407,"rank":955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1112,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.2016363636364,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
