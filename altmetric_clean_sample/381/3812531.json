This study evaluated the frequency and predictors of malaria over-treatment among febrile malaria-negative children in Kenya.\nBetween 2012 and 2013, 1,362 children presenting consecutively with temperature \u226537.5\u00b0C to Kisii and Homa Bay hospitals were enrolled in a cross-sectional study evaluating causes of fever. Children were screened for malaria using smear microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests and managed according to standard of care at the hospitals. The frequency of anti-malarial prescriptions among children with laboratory-confirmed malaria negative children (malaria over-treatment) was determined; and clinical and demographic correlates of overtreatment evaluated using logistic regression. Because of differences in malaria endemicity, analyses were stratified and compared by site.\nAmong 1,362 children enrolled, 46 (7%) of 685 children in Kisii, and 310 (45.8%) of 677 in Homa Bay had laboratory-confirmed malaria; p\u2009<\u20090.001. Among malaria-negative children; 210 (57.2%) in Homa Bay and 45 (7.0%) in Kisii received anti-malarials; p\u2009<\u20090.001. Predictors of over-treatment in Homa Bay included\u2009\u2265\u2009one integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) danger sign (aOR\u2009=\u20098.47; 95% CI: 4.81-14.89), fever lasting\u2009\u2265\u2009seven days (aOR\u2009=\u20094.94; 95% CI: 1.90-12.86), and fever \u226539\u00b0C (aOR\u2009=\u20093.07; 95% CI: 1.58-5.96). In Kisii, only fever \u226539\u00b0C predicted over-treatment (aOR\u2009=\u20092.13; 95% CI: 1.02-4.45).\nMalaria over-treatment was common, particularly in Homa Bay, where the prevalence of malaria was extremely high. Severe illness and high or prolonged fever were associated with overtreatment. Overtreatment may result in failure to treat other serious causes of fever, drug resistance, and unnecessarily treatment costs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086b","authors":["Onchiri, Frankline M","Pavlinac, Patricia B","Singa, Benson O","Naulikha, Jacqueline M","Odundo, Elizabeth A","Farquhar, Carey","Richardson, Barbra A","John-Stewart, Grace","Walson, Judd L","Frankline M Onchiri","Patricia B Pavlinac","Benson O Singa","Jacqueline M Naulikha","Elizabeth A Odundo","Carey Farquhar","Barbra A Richardson","Grace John-Stewart","Judd L Walson"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12936-015-0613-7","first_seen_on":"2015-03-20T07:13:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","phs"],"issns":["1475-2875",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Malaria Journal","last_mentioned_on":1480789834,"links":["http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/14\/1\/97","http:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12936-015-0613-7","https:\/\/malariajournal.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12936-015-0613-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.malariajournal.com\/content\/pdf\/s12936-015-0613-7.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4349314","pmid":"25890202","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Parasitology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Tropical Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"97","title":"Frequency and correlates of malaria over-treatment in areas of differing malaria transmission: a cross-sectional study in rural Western Kenya","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frequency-correlates-malaria-overtreatment-areas-differing-malaria-transmission-crosssectional-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":3053141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4764392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200477,"mean":9.2407082743073,"rank":67919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":131379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200477,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2797,"mean":4.7447503576538,"rank":1263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2797,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":4.141625,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
