In Arabidopsis thaliana genetic studies have demonstrated that RDR2 and RDR6 are involved in the synthesis of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from single stranded RNA (ssRNA) targeted by RNA silencing. The dsRNA is subsequently cleaved by the ribonuclease DICER-like into secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that reinforce and\/or maintain the silenced state of the target RNA. Models of RNA silencing propose that RDRs could use primer-independent and primer-dependent initiation to generate dsRNA from a transcript targeted by primary siRNA or microRNA (miRNA). However, the biochemical activities of RDR proteins are still partly understood. Here, we obtained active recombinant RDR2 and RDR6 in a purified form. We demonstrate that RDR2 and RDR6 have primer-independent and primer-dependent RNA polymerase activities with different efficiencies. We further show that RDR2 and RDR6 can initiate dsRNA synthesis either by elongation of 21- to 24- nucleotides RNAs hybridized to complementary RNA template or by elongation of self-primed RNA template. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RNA silencing in plants.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Anthony Devert","Nicolas Fabre","Ma\u00efna Floris","Bruno Canard","Christophe Robaglia","Patrice Cr\u00e9t\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0120100","first_seen_on":"2015-03-22T13:15:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1426942542,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25793874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25793874","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Primer-Dependent and Primer-Independent Initiation of Double Stranded RNA Synthesis by Purified Arabidopsis RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases RDR2 and RDR6.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primerdependent-primerindependent-initiation-double-stranded-rna-synthesis-purified-arabidopsis-rnad"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4897429,"mean":5.8231987692332,"rank":3269662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1432459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4897429,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145338,"mean":10.225872833484,"rank":99351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":39221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145338,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86558,"mean":9.1571217117045,"rank":59918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":22994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86558,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4149,"mean":9.6877632594021,"rank":2976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4149,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
