We hypothesized that associations would be stronger with non-lacunar stroke, since we expected left atrial abnormality to reflect the risk of thromboembolism rather than in-situ cerebral small-vessel occlusion.\nOur cohort comprised 14,542 participants 45-64 years of age prospectively enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and free of clinically apparent atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline. Left atrial abnormality was defined as PTFV1 >4,000 \u03bcV*ms. Outcomes were adjudicated ischemic stroke, non-lacunar (including cardioembolic) ischemic stroke, and lacunar stroke.\nDuring a median follow-up period of 22 years (interquartile range, 19-23 years), 904 participants (6.2%) experienced a definite or probable ischemic stroke. A higher incidence of stroke occurred in those with baseline left atrial abnormality (incidence rate per 1,000 person-years, 6.3; 95% CI, 5.4-7.4) than in those without (incidence rate per 1,000 person-years, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.7-3.1; P\u2009<\u20090.001). In Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders and incident AF, left atrial abnormality was associated with incident ischemic stroke (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.59). This association was limited to non-lacunar stroke (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.07) as opposed to lacunar stroke (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57-1.40). This article is protected by copyright.
