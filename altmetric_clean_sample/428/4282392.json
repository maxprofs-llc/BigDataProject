Some patients with CRS have suboptimal response to current guideline treatments. These patients remain severe and uncontrolled by treatment and have a poor quality of life. It is highly important to identify both clinical and biological markers, so-called biomarkers, in this subset of patients. The presence of nasal polyps and comorbidity with asthma and with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) are the most common clinical traits that have been associated to difficult-to-treat severe CRS. In addition to clinical traits, numerous biological markers, with known etiopathogenic roles in CRS, have been associated to difficult-to-treat or recalcitrant CRS. This review summarizes the existing knowledge of the clinical and biological markers associated to difficult-to-treat or uncontrolled severe CRS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007046","authors":["Mauricio L\u00f3pez-Chac\u00f3n","Joaquim Mullol","Laura Pujols"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11882-015-0520-6","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T05:00:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-6315"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current Allergy and Asthma Reports","last_mentioned_on":1437052640,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11882-015-0520-6","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11882-015-0520-6?utm_content=bufferb0830&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11882-015-0520-6.pdf","pmid":"26134430","pubdate":"2015-07-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Allergology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Clinical and Biological Markers of Difficult-to-Treat Severe Chronic Rhinosinusitis","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-biological-markers-difficulttotreat-severe-chronic-rhinosinusitis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5361876,"mean":6.2737966614312,"rank":2474912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2752518,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5361876,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184849,"mean":8.6052539167318,"rank":84323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":94139,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184849,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":384,"mean":3.1889138381201,"rank":177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":384,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
