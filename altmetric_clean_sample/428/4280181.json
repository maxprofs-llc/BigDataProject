Concatenation of the chemical hydrogen-fixation route with an oxidase-mediated activation of methanol gives an artificial methylotrophic in vitro metabolism providing methanol-derived reduction equivalents for synthetic hydrogenation purposes. Moreover, for the first time methanol reforming at room temperature was achieved on the basis of this bioinduced dehydrogenation path delivering hydrogen gas from aqueous methanol.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Heim, Leo E.","Thiel, Daniel","Gedig, Christian","Deska, Jan","Prechtl, Martin H.
