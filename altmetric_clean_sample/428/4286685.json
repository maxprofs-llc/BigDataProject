For a substantial proportion of young men, cohabitation seemed to represent an adaptive strategy during a period of career immaturity, whereas marriage was a far more likely outcome for both stably employed cohabitors and noncohabitors alike. Earnings positively affected the entry into either a cohabiting or marital union but exhibited a strong threshold effect. Once the men were in cohabiting unions, however, earnings had little effect on the odds of marrying. Men with better long-run socioeconomic prospects were far more likely to marry from either the noncohabiting or cohabiting state, and this was particularly true for blacks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026d7","authors":["Oppenheimer, Valerie Kincade"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T04:02:53+00:00","issns":["0070-3370"],"issue":"1","journal":"Demography","last_mentioned_on":1437222034,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/12647517\/?i=18&from=\/22268248\/related"],"pmid":"12647517","pubdate":"2003-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Demography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Cohabiting and marriage during young men's career-development process.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cohabitation-marriage-during-young-mens-careerdevelopment-process"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366929,"mean":6.2764892370478,"rank":2849827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1823427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366929,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174324,"mean":8.8276423306163,"rank":96777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174324,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":10.734413913043,"rank":464,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":32.631157894737,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
