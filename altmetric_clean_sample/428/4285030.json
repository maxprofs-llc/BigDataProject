Since integrin adhesion determines cell behavior, the proposed role of PrP in cell adhesion may underlie the various in vitro and in vivo effects associated to PrP loss-of-function, including the immune phenotypes described in PrP(-\/-) mice. We have investigated the role of PrP in the adhesion and (transendothelial) migration of human (pro)monocytes. We found that PrP regulates \u03b21 integrin-mediated adhesion of monocytes. Additionally, PrP controls cell morphology and migratory behavior of monocytes: PrP-silenced cells show deficient uropod formation on immobilized VCAM and display bleb-like protrusions on the endothelium. Our data further show that PrP regulates ligand-induced integrin activation. Finally, we found that PrP controls the activation of several proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, including RhoA and its effector cofilin as well as proteins of the ERM family. We propose that PrP modulates \u03b21 integrin adhesion and migration of monocytes through RhoA-induced actin remodeling by cofilin and through the regulation of ERM-mediated membrane-cytoskeleton linkage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce4","authors":["Dion D.
