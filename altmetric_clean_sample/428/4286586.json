The actuation is reversible for many cycles without losing its form and size with unfolding at room temperature and folding above 35 \u00b0C. The system is promising for making 3D bioscaffolds, electrodes, and micro-\/macroactuators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Jiang, Shaohua","Liu, Fangyao","Lerch, Arne","Ionov, Leonid","Agarwal, Seema"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201502133","endpage":"4870","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T02:37:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-4095"],"issue":"33","journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1437100592,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502133\/full;jsessionid=C5059FBA15E5D0FBD7785056A00B6018.f01t04?identityKey=605ec29d-50bb-41ce-870c-0f4b95fc50c9&isReportingDone=false&wol1URL=%2Fdoi%2F10.1002%2Fadma.201502133%2Ffull%C2%AEionCode%3DGB-EN"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201502133\/pdf","pmid":"26186175","pubdate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"startpage":"4865","subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Unusual and Superfast Temperature\u2010Triggered Actuators","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unusual-superfast-temperaturetriggered-actuators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6402872,"mean":5.9842956326932,"rank":3018456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1915594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6402872,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176510,"mean":8.8679575092489,"rank":96806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":62172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176510,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3236,"mean":10.127787944359,"rank":1818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3236,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":11.679742857143,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
