However, clinical studies concerning the association between lipid levels and depression are inconsistent. Adipokines (like leptin and adiponectin) and ghrelin are strongly associated with lipid metabolism. Fish oil, which is reported to possess antidepressant effect, also have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and the cardiovascular system. In the present study, we investigated lipid metabolism in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and the effect of fish oil on lipid profiles, aforementioned adipokines and ghrelin.\nSucrose preference test (SPT), open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST) were used to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of fish oil. After the behavior tests, peripheral blood were collected. Serum parameters, including fasting triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TCH), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), free fatty acid (FFA), glucose (GLU), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin) and ghrelin were assayed.\nAfter 5\u00a0weeks of CUMS procedures, rats were induced to depressive-like state, and exhibited increased serum levels of TCH, HDL-c, FFA and decreased serum levels of leptin and ghrelin, whereas the serum status of adiponectin, GLU, TG and LDL-c remained stable. Fish oil treatment showed robust antidepressant effect and reversed the stress-induced lipid disturbance and decrease in serum concentration of ghrelin.\nOur results suggested that CUMS altered the serum levels of lipid profiles, leptin and ghrelin in rats. Fish oil supplementation not only provided antidepressant-like effects, but also reversed the altered lipid profiles and ghrelin level in serum. Our data indicated that fish oil treatment exerts anti-depressant effect and regulates lipid disturbance simultaneously.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","authors":["Mimi Tang","Pei Jiang","Huande Li","Yiping Liu","Hualin Cai","Ruili Dang","Wenye Zhu","Lingjuan Cao"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12906-015-0778-1","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T01:11:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1459003718,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/15\/239","http:\/\/bmccomplementalternmed.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12906-015-0778-1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12906-015-0778-1.pdf","pmid":"26183327","pubdate":"2015-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chiropractic Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Fish oil supplementation alleviates depressant-like behaviors and modulates lipid profiles in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fish-oil-supplementation-alleviates-depressantlike-behaviors-modulates-lipid-profiles-rats-exposed-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":3198780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4158538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210236,"mean":8.2992859799749,"rank":84390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":123285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210236,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1834,"mean":6.266819421713,"rank":806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1834,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":3.2104395604396,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
