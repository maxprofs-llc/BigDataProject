Here we report the draft genome sequence of Paenirhodobacter enshiensis DW2-9(T) and comparison results to the available related genomes. The strain has a 3.4 Mbp genome sequence with G\u2009+\u2009C content of 66.82\u00a0% and 2781 protein-coding genes. It lacks photosynthetic gene clusters and putative proteins necessary in Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, but contains proteins in Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway instead. It shares 699 common genes with nine related Rhodobacteraceae genomes, and possesses 315 specific genes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc83","authors":["Dan Wang","Fengqiu Zhu","Xiaoli Zhu","Shixue Zheng","Rui Wang","Gejiao Wang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40793-015-0026-9","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T00:21:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1944-3277"],"journal":"Standards in Genomic Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1437685220,"links":["http:\/\/www.standardsingenomics.com\/content\/10\/1\/38"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.standardsingenomics.com\/content\/pdf\/s40793-015-0026-9.pdf","pmid":"26221419","pubdate":"2015-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Draft genomic sequence of a selenite-reducing bacterium, Paenirhodobacter enshiensis DW2-9\n\n                   T ","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/draft-genomic-sequence-selenitereducing-bacterium-paenirhodobacter-enshiensis-dw29t"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5393711,"mean":6.2953748280863,"rank":2488948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2769434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5393711,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190400,"mean":8.594987032495,"rank":86602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":97223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190400,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":355,"mean":1.8424745762712,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":355,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.6785714285714,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
