Incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of fungemia were analysed.\n\u2003Fungemia occurred in 333 (0.23%; 95% CI, 0.21 - 0.26) patients, ranging from 0.15% in patients with solid tumors to 1.55% in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. In 297 evaluable patients age ranged from 17 - 88 years (median 56 years), 144 (48%) patients were female, 165 (56%) had solid tumors, and 140 (47%) had hematological malignancies. Fungemia including polymicrobial infection was due to: Candida spp. in 267 (90%), C. albicans in 128 (48%) and other Candida spp. in 145 (54%) patients. Favorable overall response was achieved in 113 (46.5%) patients by week 2. After 4 weeks, the survival rate was 64% (95% CI, 59% - 70%) and was not significantly different between Candida spp. Multivariable logistic regression identified baseline septic shock (OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.22 - 7.58) and tachypnoea as poor prognostic factors (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.66 - 5.24), while antifungal prophylaxis prior to fungemia (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.62) and remission of underlying cancer (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.50) were protective.\n\u2003Fungemia, mostly due to Candida spp. was rare in cancer patients from EORTC centers, but was associated with substantial mortality. Antifungal prophylaxis and remission of cancer predicted better survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Cornely, O A","Gachot, B","Akan, H","Bassetti, M","Uzun, O","Kibbler, C","Marchetti, O","de Burghgraeve, P","Ramadan, S","Pylkkanen, L","Ameye, L","Paesmans, M","Donnelly, J P",", "],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/civ293","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T12:41:06+00:00","issns":["1537-6591","1058-4838"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1461352534,"links":["http:\/\/m.cid.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/61\/3\/324","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25870323?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25870323","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Epidemiology and Outcome of Fungemia in a Cancer Cohort of the Infectious Diseases Group (IDG) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 65031).","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-outcome-fungemia-cancer-cohort-infectious-diseases-group-idg-european-organization-rese"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7588328,"mean":6.5418890751503,"rank":5473283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1846267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7588328,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":211083,"mean":8.3225943187957,"rank":133930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":64388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":211083,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7425,"mean":8.3416263469828,"rank":5886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":1271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7425,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":11.659658914729,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
