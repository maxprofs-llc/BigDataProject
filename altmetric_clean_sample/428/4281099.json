Peroxide toxicity has been documented in cell, in tissue, and in isolated organs. To decrease the infused peroxide load and to protect the quality of the parenteral nutrients, we tested the photoprotective properties of different infusion sets.\nSolutions of fat-free TPN and all-in-one total nutrient admixture (TNA) were run through sets of bags (clear and covered) and tubings (clear and colored: black, orange, and yellow) offering different levels of protection against light. Peroxide levels were determined by ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange, thiol functions by the 5,5,-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) technique, and absorbance of tubings by spectroscopy.\nProtection of only the bag had little effect on peroxide generation. In fat-free TPN solutions kept in covered bags, peroxide concentrations were 1.5 to 2 times higher when run through clear compared with colored tubings. When exposed to phototherapy or in the presence of lipids, peroxides were two to three times higher with the clear compared with the black tubing; meanwhile, orange and yellow tubings offered varying levels of protection related to their light-absorbing properties. Colored tubings offered a greater protection against the disappearance of thiol functions.\nCovering bags and using orange and yellow tubings may be a practical solution to reduce infused peroxide loads from about 400 to 100 microM. This is especially relevant in patients with an immature or a compromised antioxidant capacity or when phototherapy or preparations of TNA are used.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005ae0","authors":["Sophie Laborie","Jean-Claude Lavoie","Marjolain Pineault","Philippe Chessex"],"doi":"10.1177\/0148607199023002104","endpage":"108","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T20:33:25+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0148-6071","1941-2444"],"issue":"2","journal":"JPEN Journal of Parenteral & Enteral Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1470555247,"links":["http:\/\/pen.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/2\/104.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pen.sagepub.com\/content\/23\/2\/104.full.pdf","pmid":"10082001","pubdate":"1999-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"104","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Protecting Solutions of Parenteral Nutrition From Peroxidation","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protecting-solutions-parenteral-nutrition-peroxidation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":4334500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2270623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226818,"mean":8.3756180797737,"rank":120960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":83282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226818,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1153,"mean":4.9255451388889,"rank":768,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1153,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":4.0911764705882,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
