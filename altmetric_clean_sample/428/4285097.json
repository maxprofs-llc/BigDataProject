In contrast, very little is known about the role of autophagy in ERQC. Macro-autophagy, a collection of pathways that deliver proteins through autophagosomes (APs) for degradation in the lysosome (vacuole in yeast), is mediated by autophagy-specific proteins, Atgs, and regulated by Ypt\/Rab GTPases. Until recently, the term ER-phagy was used to describe degradation of ER membrane and proteins in the lysosome under stress: either ER stress induced by drugs or whole-cell stress induced by starvation. These two types of stresses induce micro-ER-phagy, which does not use autophagic organelles and machinery, and non-selective autophagy. Here, we characterize the macro-ER-phagy pathway and uncover its role in ERQC. This pathway delivers 20-50% of certain ER-resident membrane proteins to the vacuole and is further induced to >90% by overexpression of a single integral-membrane protein. Even though such overexpression in cells defective in macro-ER-phagy induces the unfolded-protein response (UPR), UPR is not needed for macro-ER-phagy. We show that macro-ER-phagy is dependent on Atgs and Ypt GTPases and its cargo passes through APs. Moreover, for the first time the role of Atg9, the only integral-membrane core Atg, is uncoupled from that of other core Atgs. Finally, three sequential steps of this pathway are delineated: Atg9-dependent exit from the ER en route to autophagy, Ypt1- and core Atgs-mediated pre-autophagsomal-structure organization, and Ypt51-mediated delivery of APs to the vacuole.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Zhanna Lipatova","Nava Segev"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005390","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T17:47:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1439320116,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1005390","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4504476\/","http:\/\/feeds.plos.org\/~r\/plosgenetics\/NewArticles\/~3\/Hyq09lro8vw\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1005390"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgenetics\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pgen.1005390.PDF","pmid":"26181331","pubdate":"2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"A Role for Macro-ER-Phagy in ER Quality Control","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-macroerphagy-er-quality-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5472368,"mean":6.3578424367363,"rank":2242662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3201270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5472368,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188894,"mean":8.5496617767732,"rank":73337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":114059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188894,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4647,"mean":10.109256564787,"rank":2708,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4647,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191,"mean":7.1966421052632,"rank":117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
