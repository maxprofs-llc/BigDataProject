Anterior chamber depth (ACD), posterior corneal surface-to-ICL distance (endo-ICL distance), pupil size, and postoperative vaulting were evaluated using the Visante anterior chamber optical coherence tomography system. Images were taken during the non-accommodative and accommodative states 3 months after ICL implantation. Refractive error, keratometry values, axial length, intraocular pressure, and central corneal thickness were evaluated at 3 months postoperatively.\nICL vaulting did not significantly change during accommodation in eyes with either the V4 or V4c ICL (P = 0.532 for V4 ICL and P = 0.415 for V4c ICL). However, significant reductions in ACD, endo-ICL distance, and pupil size were observed during accommodation in both groups. In eyes with a V4 ICL, the change in [\u0394] ACD was 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm (P < 0.001), \u0394endo-ICL distance was 0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm (P < 0.001), and \u0394pupil size was 0.5 \u00b1 0.9 mm (P = 0.021). For eyes with the V4c ICL, \u0394ACD was 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm (P < 0.001), \u0394endo-ICL distance was 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm (P < 0.001), and \u0394pupil size was 0.8 \u00b1 1.2 mm (P < 0.001). The mean reductions of each parameter were not statistically different between eyes with the V4 ICL and the V4c ICL.\nContrary to the light stimulation response, accommodation does not significantly affect ICL vaulting differently in eyes with either the V4 or V4C ICLs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Lee, Hun","Yong Kang, David Sung","Ha, Byoung Jin","Choi, Moonjung","Kim, Eung Kweon","Seo, Kyoung Yul","Kim, Tae-Im"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajo.2015.07.014","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T00:46:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9394","1879-1891"],"journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1437141199,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00421-3\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00421-3\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(15)00421-3\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002939415004213\/pdf","pmid":"26189089","pubdate":"2015-07-21T22:01:33+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Effect of accommodation on vaulting and movement of posterior chamber phakic lenses in eyes with implantable collamer lenses","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-accommodation-vaulting-movement-posterior-chamber-phakic-lenses-eyes-implantable-collamer-len"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5364474,"mean":6.2757434592384,"rank":3775798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":899510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5364474,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174298,"mean":8.8280315209099,"rank":122084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":33474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174298,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1639,"mean":2.0968473748474,"rank":1101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1639,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.9743902439024,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
