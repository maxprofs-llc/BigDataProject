Populations of bacteria, molds, and yeasts associated with fresh-cut produce decreased to non-detectable levels following a high pressure (HP) treatment of 400\u00a0MPa for 10\u00a0min at room temperature, except for spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus spp. which were inactivated when subjected to 600\u00a0MPa at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The HP treatment of 400\u00a0MPa for 5-10\u00a0min at room temperature for fresh-cut lotus root and pineapple may be commercially feasible as an alternative to chemical sterilization and thermal blanching, respectively. The HP treatment reduced the epiphytic microorganisms of the products to non-detectable levels, and the microbial counts remained at the initial levels during storage at 1\u00a0\u00b0C with minimal changes in physicochemical and visual quality of the products. However, the HP treatment induced cellular disruption in plant tissue that contributed to the changes in appearance of several fresh-cut vegetables. To improve storage quality, combining lower pressures with complementary technologies should be useful for successful application of HP for other fresh-cut produce.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90b3cf058f61000caa9","authors":["Izumi, Hidemi"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-94-017-9918-8_25","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T16:30:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0306-0225"],"journal":"Sub cellular biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1446308618,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26174398?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26174398","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biophysics and Biological Physics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry\/Food Science, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Protein Science","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Use of Pressure for Improving Storage Quality of Fresh-Cut Produce.","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pressure-improving-storage-quality-freshcut-produce"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6510470,"mean":6.0313826788807,"rank":4814766,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":956851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6510470,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193634,"mean":8.6649884678749,"rank":135405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193634,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":1.9416989247312,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":8.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yeast_papers\/status\/621718458221248512","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4284889],"posted_on":"2015-07-16T16:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!
