However, the relationship between cell death and T-cell differentiation is still unclear.\nWe have analyzed cell death, immunosenescence and differentiation parameters in HAART-treated subjects (VL <50\u00a0copies\/mL for more than 2\u00a0years) with CD4 T-cell count <350\u00a0cells\/\u03bcL (immunodiscordant, n\u00a0=\u00a023) or >400\u00a0cells\/\u03bcL (immunoconcordant, n\u00a0=\u00a033). We included 11 healthy individuals as reference.\nAs expected, suboptimal CD4 T-cell recovery was associated with low frequencies of na\u00efve cells, high frequencies of transitional and effector memory cells and a subsequent low ratio of central\/transitional memory cells in the CD4 compartment. These alterations correlated with spontaneous CD4 T-cell death. A deeper analysis of cell death in CD4 T-cell subsets showed increased cell death in memory cells of immunodiscordant individuals, mainly affecting central memory cells. Immunosenescence was also higher in immunodiscordant individuals albeit unrelated to cell death. The CD8 compartment was similar in both HIV-infected groups, except for an underrepresentation of na\u00efve cells in immunodiscordant individuals.\nImmunodiscordant individuals show alterations in memory CD4 T-cell differentiation associated with a short ex vivo lifespan of central memory cells and an in vivo low central\/transitional memory cell ratio. These alterations may contribute to poor CD4 T-cell repopulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Marta Massanella","Elisabet G\u00f3mez-Mora","Jorge Carrillo","Marta Curriu","Dan Ouchi","Jordi Puig","Eug\u00e8nia Negredo","Cecilia Cabrera","Bonaventura Clotet","Juli\u00e0 Blanco"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-015-0601-2","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T23:57:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1438802960,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/230"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s12967-015-0601-2.pdf","pmid":"26183947","pubdate":"2015-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Increased ex vivo cell death of central memory CD4 T cells in treated HIV infected individuals with unsatisfactory immune recovery","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increased-ex-vivo-cell-death-central-memory-cd4-t-cells-treated-hiv-infected-individuals-unsatisfact-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":2260299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3098451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186541,"mean":8.6064341910583,"rank":74018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":108824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186541,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":4.1391678641411,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":2.6353333333333,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
