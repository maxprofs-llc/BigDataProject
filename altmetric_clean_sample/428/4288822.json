However, clandestine graves can be difficult to locate; and the detection rates for a variety of search methods (ranging from simple ground probing through to remote imaging and near-surface geophysics) can be very low. In this study, simulated graves of homicide victims were emplaced in three sites with contrasting soil types, bedrock, and depositional environments. The long-term monthly in\u00a0situ monitoring of grave soil water revealed rapid increases in conductivity up to 2\u00a0years after burial, with the longest study evidencing declining values to background levels after 4.25\u00a0years. Results were corrected for site temperatures and rainfall to produce generic models of fluid conductivity as a function of time. The research suggests soilwater conductivity can give reliable PBI estimates for clandestine burials and therefore be used as a grave detection method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db2","authors":["Pringle, Jamie K.","Cassella, John P.","Jervis, John R.","Williams, Anna","Cross, Peter","Cassidy, Nigel J."],"doi":"10.1111\/1556-4029.12802","endpage":"1060","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T16:35:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1556-4029","00221198"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Forensic Sciences (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1495110002,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802\/abstract;jsessionid=6DA747015FA4B85406578576C7F2603F.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802\/abstract;jsessionid=381CEA8174E1C232DC6DF6DB70A1C9B5.f02t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802\/abstract;jsessionid=C16B20DCA0B4341135326022E01D9712.f01t04","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802","https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1556-4029.12802\/pdf","pmid":"26190264","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1052","subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Soilwater Conductivity Analysis to Date and Locate Clandestine Graves of Homicide Victims","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soilwater-conductivity-analysis-date-locate-clandestine-graves-homicide-victims"},"altmetric_score":{"score":54.15,"score_history":{"1y":46,"6m":43,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":54.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":167507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8056073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213889,"mean":8.5745130535608,"rank":6085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":207799,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213889,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1597,"mean":5.5372957393484,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1574,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1597,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141,"mean":2.5594142857143,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
