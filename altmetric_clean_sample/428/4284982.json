A meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively compare the therapeutic effects of FTC\/TDF combination with TDF alone in CHB patients. Five studies involving 614 patients were identified, and subgroup analysis was performed based on the nucleos(t)ide treatment history. Our results revealed that in patients with nucleos(t)ide-na\u00efve treatment, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups with TDF alone and FTC\/TDF combination after 12 and 24 weeks; however, the FTC\/TDF combination showed better viral suppression efficacy versus TDF alone after 48 (OR\u2009=\u20092.16, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.06-4.41, P\u2009=\u20090.03), 96 (OR\u2009=\u20092.76, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.29-5.92, P\u2009=\u20090.009) and 192 weeks (OR\u2009=\u20092.60, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.21-5.56, P\u2009=\u20090.01). In patients with nucleos(t)ide treatment history, no differences were noted between the two treatment groups after 12, 24, 48 and 96 weeks. Our results indicated that FTC\/TDF combination showed better viral suppression efficacy versus TDF alone in CHB patients with nucleos(t)ide-na\u00efve treatment, while both treatments provided similar viral suppression efficacy in CHB patients with nucleos(t)ide treatment history.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Guangying Cui","Guangying Cui","Xuejun Xu","Hongyan Diao"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep11854","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T17:07:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1437066398,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/srep\/2015\/150713\/srep11854\/full\/srep11854.html"],"pmid":"26165204","pubdate":"2015-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Hepatitis B","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Viral infection","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Comparative Meta-Analysis of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate versus Emtricitabine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate as Treatments for Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-metaanalysis-tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-versus-emtricitabine-tenofovir-disoproxil-fum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5361876,"mean":6.2737966614312,"rank":3774087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":898806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5361876,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184848,"mean":8.6053396917453,"rank":128807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184848,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18677,"mean":13.5896292568,"rank":13616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":3007,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18677,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":11.405934601665,"rank":1234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":300,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"KR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/movedoc\/status\/621727652907323392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4284982],"posted_on":"2015-07-16T17:06:38+00:00","author":{"name":"movedoc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/487224327742300160\/w4PRka4j_normal.jpeg","description":"Clinical Neurologist, Movement Disorder Specialist, Researcher, Lecturer, special interests in epidemiology and evidence-based medicine, Musica Philos.","id_on_source":"movedoc","tweeter_id":"147037163","geo":{"lt":37,"ln":127.5,"country":"KR"},"followers":523},"tweet_id":"621727652907323392"}]}}
