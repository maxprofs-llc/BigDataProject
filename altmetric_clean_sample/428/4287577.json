The acidic whey obtained from lactic acid fermentation by immobilized Lactobacillus plantarum sp. TISTR 2265 was fed into the bioreactor of the aerobic SBR in an appropriate ratio between acidic whey and cheese whey to produce an acidic environment below 4.5 and then was used to support the growth of Dioszegia sp. TISTR 5792 by inhibiting bacterial contamination. At the optimal condition for a high yield of biomass production, the system was run with a Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 4 d, a Solid Retention Time (SRT) of 8.22 d, and an acidic whey concentration of 80% feeding. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) decreased from 25,230\u00a0mg\/L to 6,928\u00a0mg\/L, which represented a COD removal of 72.15%. The yield of biomass production and lactose utilization by Dioszegia sp. TISTR 5792 were 13.14\u00a0g\/L and 33.36%, respectively, with a long run of up to 180\u00a0cycles and the pH values of effluent were rose up to 8.32 without any pH adjustment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100011dd","authors":["Monkoondee, Sarawut","Kuntiya, Ampin","Chaiyaso, Thanongsak","Leksawasdi, Noppol","Techapun, Charin","Kawee-Ai, Arthitaya","Seesuriyachan, Phisit"],"doi":"10.1080\/10826068.2015.1045612","first_seen_on":"2015-07-17T10:57:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2297"],"journal":"Preparative Biochemistry and Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1437145294,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26178473?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26178473","pubdate":"2015-07-17T22:02:39+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Treatability of Cheese Whey for Single-Cell Protein Production in Non-Sterile Systems: Part II. the Application of Aerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor (Aerobic SBR) to Produce High Biomass of Dioszegia sp.
