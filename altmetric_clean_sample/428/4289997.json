The role of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in hepatic I\/R injury remains elusive. Using human and mouse livers, we investigated the effects of I\/R on hepatocellular SIRT1. SIRT1 expression was significantly decreased after I\/R. Genetic overexpression or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 markedly suppressed defective autophagy, onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition, and hepatocyte death after I\/R, whereas SIRT1-null hepatocytes exhibited increased sensitivity to I\/R injury. Biochemical approaches revealed that SIRT1 interacts with mitofusin-2 (MFN2). Furthermore, MFN2, but not MFN1, was deacetylated by SIRT1. Moreover, SIRT1 overexpression substantially increased autophagy in wild-type cells, but not in MFN2-deficient cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that the loss of SIRT1 causes a sequential chain of defective autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hepatocyte death after I\/R.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 17 July 2015; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2015.96.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["T G Biel","T G Biel","S Lee","J A Flores-Toro","J W Dean","K L Go","M-H Lee","B K Law","M E Law","W A Dunn","I Zendejas","K E Behrns","J-S Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2015.96","first_seen_on":"2015-07-18T00:55:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1437214572,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cdd\/rss\/aop\/~3\/cA4kqz2tK9Q\/cdd.2015.96","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26184910?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26184910","pubdate":"2015-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macroautophagy","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Sirtuin 1 suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction of ischemic mouse livers in a mitofusin 2-dependent manner.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sirtuin-1-suppresses-mitochondrial-dysfunction-ischemic-mouse-livers-mitofusin-2dependent-manner"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5366972,"mean":6.2761706646097,"rank":587005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":4771655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5366972,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189450,"mean":8.6044786406898,"rank":30070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":158808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189450,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":907,"mean":5.2006092715232,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":907,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":9.36,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
