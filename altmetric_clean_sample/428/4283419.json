Serological evidence suggests that nearly 100\u00a0% of children in the United States have been infected with PIV-3 by 5\u00a0years of age. Similarly, in cattle, PIV-3 is commonly associated with bovine respiratory disease complex. A novel dolphin PIV-3 (TtPIV-1) was described by Nollens et al. in 2008 from a dolphin that was diagnosed with an unknown respiratory illness. At that time, TtPIV-1 was found to be most similar to, but distinct from, bovine PIV-3 (BPIV-3). In the present study, similar viral growth kinetics and pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and CXCL8) production were seen between BPIV-3 and TtPIV-1 in BEAS-2B, MDBK, and Vero cell lines. Initial nomenclature of TtPIV-1 was based on partial sequence of the fusion and RNA polymerase genes. Based on the similarities we saw with the in vitro work, it was important to examine the TtPIV-1 genome in more detail. Full genome sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that all six viral genes of TtPIV-1 clustered within the recently described BPIV-3 genotype B strains, and it is proposed that TtPIV-1 be re-classified with BPIV-3 genotype B strains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c88","authors":["Eberle, Kirsten C","Neill, John D","Venn-Watson, Stephanie K","McGill, Jodi L","Sacco, Randy E"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11262-015-1224-7","first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T10:18:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1572-994X"],"journal":"Virus Genes","last_mentioned_on":1437058564,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26174699?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26174699?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26174699","pubdate":"2015-07-16T22:01:26+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Virology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Novel Atlantic bottlenose dolphin parainfluenza virus TtPIV-1 clusters with bovine PIV-3 genotype B strains.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-atlantic-bottlenose-dolphin-parainfluenza-virus-ttpiv1-clusters-bovine-piv3-genotype-b-strains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5361876,"mean":6.2737966614312,"rank":3774087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":898807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5361876,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184848,"mean":8.6053383392754,"rank":128807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":35890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184848,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":341,"mean":1.3880882352941,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":341,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.1625,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":24}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
