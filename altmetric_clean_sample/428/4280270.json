However, pathways that rely on multiple promiscuous enzymes may branch, which might preclude selective production of the target compound. Here, we describe the assembly of a six-enzyme pathway in Escherichia coli for the synthesis of C50-astaxanthin, a non-natural purple carotenoid. We show that by judicious matching of engineered size-selectivity variants of the first two enzymes in the pathway, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDS) and carotenoid synthase (CrtM), branching and the production of non-target compounds can be suppressed, enriching the proportion of C50 backbones produced. We then further extend the C50 pathway using evolved or wild-type downstream enzymes. Despite not containing any substrate- or product-specific enzymes, the resulting pathway detectably produces only C50 carotenoids, including \u223c90% C50-astaxanthin. Using this approach, highly selective pathways can be engineered without developing absolutely specific enzymes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Furubayashi, Maiko","Ikezumi, Mayu","Takaichi, Shinichi","Maoka, Takashi","Hemmi, Hisashi","Ogawa, Takuya","Saito, Kyoichi","Tobias, Alexander V","Umeno, Daisuke"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms8534","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T16:28:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1723","2041-1733"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1446133246,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26168783?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ncomms8534","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms8534.epdf?shared_access_token=2wDzTdfvXQzGXE2MtpqHstRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OPqYUxvZBb-tEAoZ9Xx27nerMMFCb-1MjL-QxwIgJMmqfkTnV8jTBefP6pYLdaIp-0tjkETFLDNGAvdmKTXs4PFIoGLcnUZtdvW16OWPzekmqX7zGGXta0PO5_E2ZGEog%3D","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/150714\/ncomms8534\/full\/ncomms8534.html"],"pmid":"26168783","pubdate":"2015-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["science","biology"],"title":"A highly selective biosynthetic pathway to non-natural C50 carotenoids assembled from moderately selective enzymes","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highly-selective-biosynthetic-pathway-nonnatural-c50-carotenoids-assembled-moderately-selective-enzy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6504996,"mean":6.0272765079752,"rank":2230534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4225808,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6504996,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194131,"mean":8.6484544789576,"rank":69006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":123113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194131,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9890,"mean":38.150832440085,"rank":6749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9890,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":726,"mean":33.155649655172,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":726,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":27,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
