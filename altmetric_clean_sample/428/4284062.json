In our subsequent analyses, we only included articles whose main topic was autism and that referred to at least one treatment. We then categorized the 137 remaining articles by treatment and rated whether each treatment category was portrayed in a favourable, unfavourable, or neutral manner.\nIn total, 46% of the articles discussed at least 1 empirically supported treatment, 53% at least 1 alternative treatment, and 12% at least 1 uncategorized treatment. Newspaper articles provided favourable, unfavourable, and neutral portrayals of empirically supported treatments in 75%, 10%, and 16% of cases, respectively. In contrast, alternative treatments were portrayed favourably in 52%, unfavourably in 32%, and neutrally in 16% of cases. Our analyses indicated that empirically supported treatments were portrayed more favourably than alternative treatments (\u03c7(2) = 10.42, df = 2, P = 0.005).\nDespite some encouraging trends, our study has shown that researchers and clinicians must continue to clarify misconceptions about autism treatment. Families of people with autism spectrum disorders should be directed toward more reliable and accurate sources of information.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db5","authors":["Lanovaz, Marc J","Dufour, Marie-Mich\u00e8le","Shah, Shalaka","Marc J Lanovaz","Marie-Mich\u00e8le Dufour","Shalaka Shah"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-16T12:25:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0706-7437"],"issue":"7","journal":"Canadian Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1470937782,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26175392?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26175392","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4500183\/"],"pmid":"26175392","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"329","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Newspaper Coverage of Autism Treatment in Canada: 10-Year Trends (2004-2013).","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/newspaper-coverage-autism-treatment-canada-10year-trends-20042013"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440707,"mean":7.0976540016831,"rank":3670987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4648182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440707,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227510,"mean":8.4402503021859,"rank":87448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":135564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227510,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":879,"mean":5.6849749430524,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":879,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7315789473684,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Linguistics":1,"Mathematics":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2,"CA":1},"mendeley":{"MY":1,"PT":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/status\/621656873452744705","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4284062],"posted_on":"2015-07-16T12:25:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"621656873452744705"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hildabast\/status\/622090968288886784","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4284062],"posted_on":"2015-07-17T17:10:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Hilda Bastian","url":"http:\/\/hildabastian.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/792769082194092032\/M5_-xvoW_normal.jpg","description":"Scientist, blogger, cartoonist.
