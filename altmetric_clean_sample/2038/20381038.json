In this study, a validated isotope label-free method of using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-MS\/MS was established for quantifying 24 drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) in FVB mice. The DMEs include cytochrome P450 (CYPs\/Cyps), UDP-glucuronsyltransferases (UGTs\/Ugts), and sulfotransferases (SULTs\/Sults), which are the major phase I and II metabolic enzymes responsible for clearing and detoxifying xenobiotic and endogenous substances. The proposed UHPLC-MS\/MS method displayed excellent dynamic range and high sensitivity for signature peptides, as well as acceptable recovery, accuracy and precision. The protein expression profiles of the DMEs were determined in male and female mice. Overall, major Cyps, Ugts, and Sults were expressed in male mice in the following rank-order: Cyp2c29 > 2e1 > 3a11 > 1a2 > 2d22 > 27a1 > 2c39; Ugt2b5 > 2b1 > 1a6a > 1a9 > 1a1 > 2a3 > 1a2 > 1a5; and Sult1a1 > 3a > 1d1. Whereas, in female mice, Cyp2c29 > 2e1 > 2c39 > 2d22 > 3a11 > 1a2 > 27a1; Ugt1a6a > 2b5 > 1a1 > 2b1 > 2a3 > 1a9 > 1a5 > 1a2; and Sult1a1 > 3a1 > 1d1. Cyp2c29, Cyp1a2, Cyp27a1, Ugt2b1, Ugt2b5 and Ugt2b36 were male-predominant. Cyp2c39, Cyp2d22, Cyp7a1, Ugt1a1, Ugt1a5, Sult1a1, Sult3a1, and Sult1d1 were female-predominant. This work could serve as a useful reference for the metabolic study of new drugs and for elucidating the effectiveness and toxicity of drugs. The method is a stable, simple, and rapid for determining the expression of DMEs in animals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f61000717a","authors":["Jiamei Chen","Lijun Zhu","Xiaoyan Li","Haihui Zheng","Tongmeng Yan","Cong Xie","Sijing Zeng","Jia Yu","Huangyu Jiang","Linlin Lu","Xiaoxiao Qi","Ying Wang","Ming Hu","Zhongqiu Liu"],"doi":"10.1124\/dmd.116.074682","first_seen_on":"2017-05-22T13:00:18+00:00","issns":["0090-9556","1521-009X"],"journal":"Drug Metabolism and Disposition","last_mentioned_on":1495458001,"links":["http:\/\/dmd.aspetjournals.org\/content\/45\/6\/624","http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1124\/dmd.116.074682"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dmd.aspetjournals.org\/content\/dmd\/45\/6\/624.full.pdf","pmid":"28356314","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"High-Throughput and Reliable Isotope Label-free Approach for Profiling 24 Metabolic Enzymes in FVB Mice and Sex Differences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highthroughput-reliable-isotope-labelfree-approach-profiling-24-metabolic-enzymes-fvb-mice-sex-diffe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":4146473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3893232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236921,"mean":12.166845500591,"rank":118568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":108309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236921,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":3.1087346437346,"rank":461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3681818181818,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DMD_Journal\/statuses\/866639787251253249","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20381038],"posted_on":"2017-05-22T13:00:01+00:00","author":{"name":"DMD (ASPET)","url":"http:\/\/dmd.aspetjournals.org\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2971825738\/a160ad2b4c6398f8f60a2e07109a0ede_normal.png","description":"'Drug Metabolism and Disposition' presents important pharmacology and toxicology research and is a valuable resource in drug design, metabolism, and transport.","id_on_source":"DMD_Journal","tweeter_id":"1009597742","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"866639787251253249"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Timeline Photos","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1631800020243131&id=377677542322058","license":"public","citation_ids":[20381038],"posted_on":"2017-05-22T13:00:00+00:00","summary":"DMD Highlight: High-Throughput and Reliable Isotope Label-free Approach for Profiling 24 Metabolic Enzymes in FVB Mice and Sex Differences\n\nSee the article by Chen et al. at Drug Metabolism and Disposition June 2017, 45 (6) 624-634; DOI:doi.org\/10.1124\/dmd","author":{"name":"Drug Metabolism and Disposition \/ DMD (ASPET)","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/377677542322058","facebook_wall_name":"Drug Metabolism and Disposition \/ DMD (ASPET)","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/377677542322058\/picture","id_on_source":"377677542322058"}}]}}
