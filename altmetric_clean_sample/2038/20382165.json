Yao, J. Wu et al."],"citation":{"abstract":"Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) have received considerable attention in the field of catalysis. However, exploitation of their maximal catalytic properties is still a chanllenge. Nanoreactors could dramatically improve activity with the help of the intrinsic confinement effect. Herein, we designed a kind of yolk\/shell FexOy\/PdPt@CeO2 composites, in which FexOy NPs acted as movable core and allowed uniform distribution of PdPt alloys on the inner surface of the CeO2 shell. Due to the porosity of CeO2 shell and existence of hollow voids, FexOy\/PdPt@CeO2 composites could be used as nanoreactors in catalytic reactions. Besides the confinement effect, two other structural aspects further contribute to enhance the catalytic activity: bimetallic PdPt alloys replacing monometallic NPs, and the reactive CeO2 shell replacing the chemically inert support. As a result, the nanoassembled catalysts displayed higher activity in catalytic reduction of dyes than the reference samples. Moreover, these catalysts were reusable because they could be quickly separated by a magnet due to the presence of the magnetic FexOy core.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Yao, Tongjie","Guan, Chenchen","Zhang, Junshuai","Zhang, Xiao","Huang, Xin","Wu, Jie","Jie Wu","Chenchen Guan","Tongjie Yao","Junshuai Zhang","Xiao Zhang","Xin Huang"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201700525","first_seen_on":"2017-05-22T13:57:47+00:00","issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1495494588,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700525\/abstract;jsessionid=FB65DBC13E8EA8FD50BCB247A878CEF7.f03t01","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201700525?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201700525\/pdf","pmid":"28406551","pubdate":"2017-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Preparation of Magnetically Recyclable Yolk\/Shell FexOy\/PdPt@CeO2 Nanoreactors with Enhanced Catalytic Activity","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":6260055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1114652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236921,"mean":12.166776067871,"rank":166370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44868,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236921,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2520,"mean":1.374774116713,"rank":925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2520,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":1.261,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/866654268648038400","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20382165],"posted_on":"2017-05-22T13:57:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
