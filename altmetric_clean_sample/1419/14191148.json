A new approach to therapy using checkpoint blockade has improved overall survival in this patient population. Ipilimumab a CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody is a first in class drug that has pioneered this revolution. In this review, the authors provide an account of the different stages that led to the development of ipilimumab, its approval in the clinical setting for the treatment of advanced melanoma and ongoing investigations of combinatorial immune therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008df2","authors":["Paul Letendre"],"doi":"10.2217\/fon-2016-0385","first_seen_on":"2016-11-30T17:49:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1744-8301","1479-6694"],"journal":"Future Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1480528145,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/full\/10.2217\/fon-2016-0385"],"pmid":"27882779","pubdate":"2016-11-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Ipilimumab: from preclinical development to future clinical perspectives in melanoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ipilimumab-preclinical-development-future-clinical-perspectives-melanoma-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7826281,"mean":6.6353071855279,"rank":3872332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3755769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7826281,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250579,"mean":12.181267725019,"rank":127280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250579,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":706,"mean":4.0285390070922,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":706,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":6.4358823529412,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IntMedatIowa\/statuses\/804019435208114176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14191148],"posted_on":"2016-11-30T17:49:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Int Med at Iowa","url":"https:\/\/internalmedicineiowa.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/467399266286047233\/V-pXufh__normal.jpeg","description":"News on and history of University of Iowa Department of Internal Medicine faculty and alumni science and honors, featuring current publications and events.","id_on_source":"IntMedatIowa","tweeter_id":"716417779","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":451},"tweet_id":"804019435208114176"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Ipilimumab: from preclinical development to future clinical perspectives in melanoma, Future Oncology, Future Medicine","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=10154375282223791&id=76564568790","license":"public","citation_ids":[14191148],"posted_on":"2016-11-30T17:49:03+00:00","summary":"ARTICLE OF THE WEEK: Ipilimumab: from preclinical development to future clinical perspectives in melanoma.\n\nAUTHORS: Letendre P, Monga V, Milhem M, Zakharia Y\n\nJOURNAL: Future Oncol. 2016 Nov 24.
