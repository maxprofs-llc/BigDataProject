HPLC-MS\/MS analysis was performed for two of the rich sources (Pilgrim and wild clone NL2) of phenolics and high antioxidant activity. Among the genotypes, Pilgrim showed the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents and wild clones NL3 and NL2 showed the highest monomeric anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin content, respectively. Protocatechuic and syringic acids were detected only in Pilgrim, whereas luteolin 7-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin 3-O-galactoside, proanthocyanidin B-type, and myricetin 3-O-galactoside were found in wild clone NL3 genotype. Moreover, proanthocyanin trimer A-type and dimer B-type predominated in the wild clone NL2, whereas proanthocyanidin dimer B and trimer A were predominant in Pilgrim.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Gihan Abeywickrama"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jafc.6b04291","first_seen_on":"2016-12-01T00:46:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0021-8561","1520-5118"],"issue":"49","journal":"Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1480362921,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.6b04291"],"pmid":"27960275","pubdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Phenolics of selected cranberry genotypes (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) and their antioxidant efficacy","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phenolics-selected-cranberry-genotypes-vaccinium-macrocarpon-ait-antioxidant-efficacy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":6774290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250376,"mean":12.187182634049,"rank":203217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250376,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5860,"mean":5.451304318143,"rank":4957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5860,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":6.6551578947368,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
