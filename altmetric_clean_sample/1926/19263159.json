In tumours that over-express the \u03b1v\u03b26 receptor, cellular uptake of liposomes can be enhanced using ligand-targeted liposomes. It has previously been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies that liposomal alendronate (L-ALD) can sensitise cancer cells to destruction by V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. It is hypothesised that by using the \u03b1v\u03b26-specific peptide A20FMDV2 as a targeting moiety for L-ALD, the therapeutic efficacy of this therapy can be increased in \u03b1v\u03b26 positive tumours. Targeted liposomes (t-L) were formulated and the targeting efficacy of targeted liposomes (t-L) was assessed by cell uptake and cytotoxicity studies in the \u03b1v\u03b26 positive cells line A375P\u03b26. Bio-distribution of both L and t-L were carried out in \u03b1v\u03b26 positive (A375P\u03b26 and PANC0403) and \u03b1v\u03b26 negative (A375Ppuro and PANC-1) subcutaneous tumour mouse models. Immuno-compromised mice bearing A375P\u03b26 experimental metastatic lung tumours were treated with L-ALD or t-L-ALD as monotherapies or in combination with ex vivo-expanded V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells. In vitro, \u03b1v\u03b26-dependant uptake of t-L was observed, with t-L-ALD being more effective than L-ALD at sensitising A375P\u03b26 to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Interestingly, t-L-ALD led to slightly higher but not significant reduction in tumour growth compared to L-ALD, when used as monotherapy in vivo. Moreover, both L-ALD and t-L-ALD led to significant reductions in tumour growth when used in combination with \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in vivo but t-L-ALD offered no added advantage compared to L-ALD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["Naomi O.
