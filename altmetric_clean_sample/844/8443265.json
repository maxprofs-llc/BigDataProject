This study describes the clinical profile, treatment, and predictors of outcome of status epilepticus in a tertiary referral centre in a developing country and aims to highlight the similarities and differences from data available from the western world. A retrospective analysis of data of patients treated for status epilepticus was conducted from prospectively maintained records, between January\u00a02000 and September\u00a02010. The demographic data, clinical profile and investigations (including neuroimaging and EEG), aetiology, treatment, and outcomes were studied and compared with data available from the western world. The analysis included 108 events in 84 patients. A single episode of status epilepticus was treated in 72 patients (86%) and multiple status epilepticus events, ranging from two to six per patient, were managed in 12 patients (14%). Mean age was 24.1\u00b120.3 years and 63% were males. The types of status epilepticus included convulsive status in 98 (90.7%), non-convulsive status in seven (6.5%), and myoclonic status in three (2.8%). The majority of events (60%) were remote symptomatic, 16% were acute symptomatic, 16% were of unexplained aetiology, and 8% were progressive symptomatic. In 85 events (79%), status epilepticus could be aborted with first and second-line drugs. The remaining 23 events (21%) progressed to refractory status epilepticus, among which, 13 (56%) were controlled with continuous intravenous midazolam infusion. Case fatality rate was 11%, neurological sequelae were reported in 22%, and 67% returned to baseline. Acute symptomatic status, older age, altered sensorium at the time of admission, and delayed hospitalisation were predictors of poor outcome. Aetiology was the most important determinant of outcome of status epilepticus, as in reports from the western world, with remote symptomatic aetiology secondary to gliosis being the most common. Treatment delay was frequent and adversely affected the outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f6100072cb","authors":["Hassan, Haseeb","Rajiv, Keni Ravish","Menon, Ramshekhar","Menon, Deepak","Nair, Muralidharan","Radhakrishnan, Ashalatha"],"doi":"10.1684\/epd.2016.0832","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T16:11:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1950-6945"],"issue":"2","journal":"Epileptic Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1464882969,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27248976?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27248976","pubdate":"2016-06-02T22:00:22+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"An audit of the predictors of outcome in status epilepticus from a resource-poor country: a comparison with developed countries.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/audit-predictors-outcome-status-epilepticus-resourcepoor-country-comparison-developed-countries"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847043,"mean":6.6493042501824,"rank":6796944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847043,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269354,"mean":11.373972207475,"rank":224441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269354,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229,"mean":1.3497456140351,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.1869565217391,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
