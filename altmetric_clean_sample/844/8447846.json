And everyone was looking at me. What skill, competency, or inner capacity must one possess to hold and manage such tension?","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b3","authors":["Feudtner, Chris"],"doi":"10.1002\/hast.590","endpage":"inside back cover","first_seen_on":"2016-06-02T20:43:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["0093-0334","1552-146X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Hastings Center Report","last_mentioned_on":1465056720,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/enhanced\/doi\/10.1002\/hast.590"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/hast.590\/pdf","pmid":"27150423","pubdate":"2016-05-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Philosophy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"inside back cover","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","ethics","psychiatry"],"title":"Holding the Tension","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/holding-tension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.248,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.248},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":445932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7405647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269400,"mean":11.373952791213,"rank":24292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":245108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269400,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":7.5703708399366,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":18.553,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
