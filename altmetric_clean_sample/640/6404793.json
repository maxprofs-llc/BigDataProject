In this study we aimed to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis of cancer in solid organ transplant recipients. An aging population began to receive solid organ transplantation and survival times prolonged. But this had a cost and new problems came forward. Especially de novo cancers because of immunosuppressive therapy took notice. Risk of malignancy increases after organ transplantation and cancer incidence was about 2.3-3.1% in these patients including skin cancer, lung cancer, malign lymphoma, cervix cancer, kaposi sarcoma, and hepatobiliary cancer.\nThe files of 328 organ transplant recipients followed from January 2004 to April 2015 at Atat\u00fcrk University Medical Faculty were retrospectively reviewed.\nEight patients developed cancer (2.4%). There were six males and two females. Age at cancer diagnosis ranged from 42 to 79 years old with average of 55 years. The interval from solid organ transplantation to cancer diagnosis ranged from 6 months to 30 years. Among the patients, five were renal transplant recipients and two were liver transplant recipients. Four patients had stage IV disease, one patient stage IIIB, and three patients had stage I disease. For none of the patients a diagnosis with screening methods was used for cancer before any complaints of tumor emerged.\nTo diagnose cancer at early stages in solid organ transplant recipients, earlier and detailed cancer screening is very important. The association between diagnosis of cancer at early stages and prolonged overall survival time is well known. Detailed and careful evaluation for occult malignancies in pre-transplantation period is also important.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c43","authors":["Turkeli, Mehmet","Simsek, Melih","Aldemir, Mehmet Naci","Yildirim, Nilgun","Cankaya, Erdem","Erdemci, Burak","Bilici, Mehmet","Tekin, Salim Basol","Arslan, Sukru","Korkut, Ercan"],"doi":"10.5152\/eurasianjmed.2015.0087","endpage":"36","first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T11:17:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1308-8734","13088734","13088742"],"issue":"1","journal":"Eurasian Journal of Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1459423038,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27026762?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27026762","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"33","title":"Are We Late in the Diagnosis of Malignities Occurring in Solid Organ Transplant Patients? 11 Years\u2019 Experience","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/we-late-diagnosis-malignities-occurring-solid-organ-transplant-patients-11-years-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":5653942,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1000374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272896,"mean":11.086624994961,"rank":191794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272896,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.3081,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/715498198735785984","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6404793],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T11:17:18+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":383},"tweet_id":"715498198735785984"}]}}
