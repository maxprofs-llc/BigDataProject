We used Drosophila as a model to investigate the effect of Asparagus cochinchinensis (A. cochinchinensis) extracts on the gut and characterized gut homeostasis following the ingestion of metal ions (copper, zinc, and aluminum). In this study, we found that the aqueous A. cochinchinensis extract increased the survival rate, decreased epithelial cell death, and attenuated metal ion-induced gut morphological changes in flies following chronic exposure to metal ions. In addition, we screened out, by network pharmacology, six natural products (NPs) that could serve as putative active components of A. cochinchinensis that prevented gut injury. Altogether, the results of our study provide evidence that A. cochinchinensis might be an effective phytomedicine for the treatment of metal ion-induced gut injury.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Zhang, Weiyu","Jin, Li Hua"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/7603746","first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T09:16:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1461926565,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/7603746\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27123034?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2016\/7603746.pdf","pmid":"27123034","pubdate":"2016-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Asparagus cochinchinensis Extract Alleviates Metal Ion-Induced Gut Injury in Drosophila: An In Silico Analysis of Potential Active Constituents","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asparagus-cochinchinensis-extract-alleviates-metal-ioninduced-gut-injury-drosophila-silico-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":3944053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2139247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274742,"mean":11.099805591448,"rank":149507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274742,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3811,"mean":4.5477238845144,"rank":1672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3811,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":2.5017410071942,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MeCoffeeBreak\/statuses\/715461839052783616","license":"gnip","rt":["MBHolistic"],"citation_ids":[6402814],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T08:52:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Taylor","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/allamerican1776","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/693857490858020864\/BINUARFu_normal.jpg","description":"#BYOB #Coffee.
