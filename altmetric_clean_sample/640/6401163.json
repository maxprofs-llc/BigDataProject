Little is known however regarding the anti-inflammatory activity of ABG. This study was performed to identify and compare the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of ABG extract (ABGE) with those of fresh raw garlic (FRG) extract (FRGE). In addition, we investigated which components are responsible for the observed effects. Hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as a pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory stressor, respectively. ABGE showed high ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities and low ROS generation in RAW264.7 cells compared with FRGE. However, inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and 5-lipooxygenase activities by FRGE was stronger than that by ABGE. FRGE reduced PGE\u2082, NO, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, LTD\u2084, and LTE\u2084 production in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells more than did ABGE. The combination of FRGE and sugar (galactose, glucose, fructose, or sucrose), which is more abundant in ABGE than in FRGE, decreased the anti-inflammatory activity compared with FRGE. FRGE-induced inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory gene expression was blocked by combination with sugars. The lower anti-inflammatory activity in ABGE than FRGE could result from the presence of sugars. Our results suggest that ABGE might be helpful for the treatment of diseases mediated predominantly by ROS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Yi Jeong"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21040430","first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T07:15:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"4","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1459406940,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/4\/430"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/4\/430\/pdf","pmid":"27043510","pubdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"430","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Comparison of Anti-Oxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Effects between Fresh and Aged Black Garlic Extracts","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-antioxidant-antiinflammatory-effects-between-fresh-aged-black-garlic-extracts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7471181,"mean":6.4836306053357,"rank":5653941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1000374,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7471181,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272895,"mean":11.086669468731,"rank":191793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272895,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3287,"mean":2.13795982958,"rank":1608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3287,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252,"mean":1.9136653386454,"rank":138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
