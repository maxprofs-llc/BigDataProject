CO2-in-water-in-oil double emulsion drops are generated using microfluidic approaches and evaporation is conducted in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and\/or graphene oxide (GO) particles dispersed in the aqueous phase of the double emulsion drops. We examine the roles of the bubble-to-drop size ratio, PVA and GO concentration in the stabilization of CO2 bubbles upon water evaporation and show that thin-shell particles with encapsulated CO2 bubbles can be obtained under optimized conditions. The developed approach offers a new strategy to study CO2 dissolution and stability on the microscale and the synthesis of novel gas-core microparticles.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Tianyi Lu","Rong Fan","Luis F.
