With increasing surgical experience, a trend toward even more minimally invasive approaches has led to laparoscopic surgery to new inovations. Current surgical procedures are: four ports (4PLC), still the gold standart technique, three ports (3PLC), two ports (2PLC) and single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC). Robotic cholecystectomy (RC) and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) are the other new techniques for performing cholecystectomy. This article aims to make an objective comparision between different types of laparoscopic cholecystectomies by using available medical literature.\nCholecystectomy, Laparoscopic, Technique.","authors":["Kartal, Kinyas","Uludag, Mehmet"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T10:24:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2239-253X"],"journal":"Annali italiani di chirurgia","last_mentioned_on":1459419858,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27026289?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27026289","pubdate":"2016-03-31T22:01:24+00:00","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Can 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy remain the gold standard for gallbladder surgery?","type":"article","volume":"87"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/715484861914419200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6404203],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T10:24:18+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"715484861914419200"}]}}
