Since obese-insulin resistant condition could impair cardiac function and that the incidence of obesity is increased in ageing men, a condition of testosterone deprivation could aggravate the cardiac dysfunction in obese-insulin resistant subjects. However, the mechanism underlying this adverse effect is unclear. This study investigated the effects of obesity on metabolic parameters, heart rate variability (HRV), left ventricular (LV) function and cardiac mitochondrial function in testosterone-deprived rats. Orchiectomized or sham operated male Wistar rats (n=36\/group) were randomly divided into groups and were given either a normal diet (19.77% fat) or a high-fat diet (57.60% fat) for 12 weeks. Metabolic parameters, HRV, LV function and cardiac mitochondrial function were determined at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the start of each feeding program. We found that insulin resistance was seen after 8 weeks of the consumption of a high-fat diet in both sham (HFS) and orchiectomized (HFO) rats. Neither the normal diet sham (NDS) group nor normal diet orchiectomized (NDO) rats developed insulin resistance. The development of depressed HRV, LV contractile dysfunction and increased cardiac mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production was observed earlier in orchiectomized (NDO and HFO) rats at week 4, whereas HFS rats exhibited these impairments later at week 8. These findings suggest that testosterone deprivation accelerates the impairment of cardiac autonomic regulation and LV function via increased oxidative stress and impaired cardiac mitochondrial function in obese-orchiectomized male rats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d78","authors":["Wanpitak  Pongkan","Hiranya  Pintana","Sivaporn  Sivasinprasan","Thidarat  Jaiwongkam","Siriporn  Chattipakorn","Nipon  Chattipakorn","Wanpitak Pongkan","Hiranya Pintana","Sivaporn Sivasinprasasn","Thidarat Jaiwongkam","Siriporn C Chattipakorn","Nipon Chattipakorn"],"doi":"10.1530\/joe-16-0002","endpage":"220","first_seen_on":"2016-03-31T10:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-6805"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1469441421,"links":["http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/21\/JOE-16-0002.abstract","http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/229\/3\/209"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/joe.endocrinology-journals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/21\/JOE-16-0002.full.pdf","pmid":"27000685","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"209","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Testosterone deprivation accelerates cardiac dysfunction in obese male rats.","type":"article","volume":"229","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/testosterone-deprivation-accelerates-cardiac-dysfunction-obese-male-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":1746879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6279269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277734,"mean":11.283115250978,"rank":78126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":198734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277734,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":944,"mean":4.105164369035,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":944,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":2.4467441860465,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Psychology":3}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/michaelscally\/statuses\/715486245627961344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6404270],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T10:29:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Michael Scally","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/843152908631719936\/g2EhokiH_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"michaelscally","tweeter_id":"97467754","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":798},"tweet_id":"715486245627961344"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/KultOnlinePL\/statuses\/715488936500408324","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6404270],"posted_on":"2016-03-31T10:40:30+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0141ukasz Nyklarz","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","id_on_source":"KultOnlinePL","tweeter_id":"240292509","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16},"tweet_id":"715488936500408324"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JEndocrinology\/statuses\/757518340449501184","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6404270],"posted_on":"2016-07-25T10:10:21+00:00","author":{"name":"J. of Endocrinology","url":"http:\/\/www.try-joe.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/686846311312797697\/zHxUHdxs_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Endocrinology publishing basic #endocrine research. @Soc_Endo @ESEndocrinology & @EndoSocAus.
