The program assumes an infinite-sites model of mutation, and allows recombination, gene conversion, symmetric migration among subpopulations, and a variety of demographic histories. The samples produced can be used to investigate the sampling properties of any sample statistic under these neutral models.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d2","authors":["Richard R.
