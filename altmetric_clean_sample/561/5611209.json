However, the decision-making process, including the informational needs of hospital decision makers, is not well described. The objective was to review empirical studies analysing the information that hospital decision makers need when deciding about health technology (HT) investments.\nA systematic review of empirical studies published in English or Danish from 2000 to 2012 was carried out. The literature was assessed by two reviewers working independently. The identified informational needs were assessed with regard to their agreement with the nine domains of EUnetHTA's Core Model.\nA total of 2,689 articles were identified and assessed. The review process resulted in 14 relevant studies containing 74 types of information that hospital decision makers found relevant. In addition to information covered by the Core Model, other types of information dealing with political and strategic aspects were identified. The most frequently mentioned types of information in the literature related to clinical, economic and political\/strategic aspects. Legal, social, and ethical aspects were seldom considered most important.\nHospital decision makers are able to describe their information needs when deciding on HT investments. The different types of information were not of equal importance to hospital decision makers, however, and full agreement between EUnetHTA's Core Model and the hospital decision-makers' informational needs was not observed. They also need information on political and strategic aspects not covered by the Core Model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6003cf058f610006257","authors":["Anne Mette\u00a0\u00d8lholm","Kristian\u00a0Kidholm","Mette\u00a0Birk-Olsen","Janne Buck\u00a0Christensen"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0266462315000665","endpage":"12","first_seen_on":"2016-02-15T12:46:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-6348"],"journal":"International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1455540402,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10191354&utm_source=First_View&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=THC"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0266462315000665","pmid":"26875930","pubdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"HOSPITAL MANAGERS\u2019 NEED FOR INFORMATION ON HEALTH TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hospital-managers-need-information-health-technology-investments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7196678,"mean":6.3286026753702,"rank":5415036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993082,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7196678,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322845,"mean":9.7386330549735,"rank":224366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322845,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":2.9708996138996,"rank":385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.2863636363636,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
