Improving its effectiveness and widening its range of use may strongly rely on development of proper stimulation protocols that are tailored to specific brain circuits and that are based on a deep knowledge of different neuron types response to stimulation. To this aim, we have performed a simulation study on the behavior of excitatory and inhibitory neurons subject to sinusoidal stimulation. Due to the intrinsic difference in membrane conductance properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we show that their firing is differentially modulated by the wave parameters. We analyzed the behavior of the two neuronal types for a broad range of stimulus frequency and amplitude and demonstrated that, within a small-world network prototype, parameters tuning allow for a selective enhancement or suppression of the excitation\/inhibition ratio.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074aa","authors":["Mahmud, Mufti","Vassanelli, Stefano"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnins.2016.00062","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T19:45:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-453X","1662-4548"],"journal":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1457182421,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnins.2016.00062\/abstract","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnins.2016.00062\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26941602?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26941602","pubdate":"2016-02-16T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Differential Modulation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons during Periodic Stimulation","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-modulation-excitatory-inhibitory-neurons-during-periodic-stimulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7351662,"mean":6.3871000458227,"rank":3333141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3854752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7351662,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284798,"mean":10.286152515651,"rank":127838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":147062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284798,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2141,"mean":6.8705373831776,"rank":1273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2141,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179,"mean":4.8076629213483,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
