Phenotypic biomarkers have the potential to improve smoking cessation outcomes by identifying the best available treatment for an individual smoker. In this review, we introduce the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) as a reliable and stable phenotypic measure of nicotine metabolism that can guide smoking cessation treatment among smokers who wish to quit. We address how the NMR accounts for sources of variation in nicotine metabolism including genotype and other biological and environmental factors such as estrogen levels, alcohol use, body mass index, or menthol exposure. Then, we highlight clinical trials that validate the NMR as a biomarker to predict therapeutic response to different pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation. Current evidence supports the use of nicotine replacement therapy for slow metabolizers, and non-nicotine treatments such as varenicline for normal metabolizers. Finally, we discuss future research directions to elucidate mechanisms underlying NMR associations with treatment response, and facilitate the implementation of the NMR as biomarker in clinical practice to guide smoking cessation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d93","authors":["Cheyenne E.
