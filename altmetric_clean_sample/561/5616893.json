For each lens, 30 measurements were performed with two optical apertures: 3.0 mm and 6.0 mm. The modulation transfer function, point spread function, Strehl ratio and a simulation of the image provided by the lens were computed from the Zernike coefficients measured up to the fourth order.\nThe root mean square error of higher-order aberrations varied significantly with material type for both optical apertures (p < 0.01). The largest difference was obtained between the Boston EO and the Boston ES materials (for a 6.0 mm aperture), the mean difference being (8.3 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10(-2) \u00b5m. The modulation transfer functions, point spread functions and Strehl ratio values were similar among all Boston materials at the smaller optical aperture; however, differences between each material were more apparent for the 6.0 mm aperture, with the Boston ES material exhibiting the best optical quality.\nIn terms of all metrics analysed, all Boston materials examined showed comparable optical quality for a 3.0 mm aperture but the Boston ES material displayed the best optical quality for a 6.0 mm optical aperture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53d3cf058f610004756","authors":["Dom\u00ednguez\u2010Vicent, Alberto","Esteve\u2010Taboada, Jose Juan","Ferrer\u2010Blasco, Teresa","Garc\u00eda\u2010L\u00e1zaro, Santiago","Mont\u00e9s\u2010Mic\u00f3, Robert","Dom\u00ednguez-Vicent, Alberto","Esteve-Taboada, Jose Juan","Ferrer-Blasco, Teresa","Garc\u00eda-L\u00e1zaro, Santiago","Mont\u00e9s-Mic\u00f3, Robert"],"doi":"10.1111\/cxo.12323","endpage":"46","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T12:11:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1444-0938"],"issue":"1","journal":"Clinical & Experimental Optometry","last_mentioned_on":1455632831,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/cxo.12323"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cxo.12323\/pdf","pmid":"26875851","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"39","subjects":["optometry"],"title":"Optical quality comparison among different Boston contact lens materials","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optical-quality-comparison-among-different-boston-contact-lens-materials-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7200541,"mean":6.3358503237224,"rank":3610376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":3564514,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7200541,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284177,"mean":10.253526378019,"rank":150950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":131866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284177,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":370,"mean":1.460379403794,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":370,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.54166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
