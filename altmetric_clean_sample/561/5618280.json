Here, we found that participants who adopted a consistent chunking strategy during symbolic sequence learning showed a greater improvement of their performance and a larger decrease in cognitive workload over time. Stronger reliance on chunking was also associated with higher scores in a WM updating task, suggesting the contribution of WM gating mechanisms to sequence chunking. Altogether, these results indicate that chunking is a cost-saving strategy that enhances effectiveness of symbolic sequence learning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610008013","authors":["Oleg Solopchuk","Andrea Alamia","Etienne Olivier","Alexandre Z\u00e9non"],"doi":"10.1101\/lm.041277.115","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T15:52:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1549-5485"],"issue":"3","journal":"Learning & Memory","last_mentioned_on":1460652466,"links":["http:\/\/learnmem.cshlp.org\/content\/23\/3\/108.abstract?etoc","http:\/\/learnmem.cshlp.org\/content\/23\/3\/108.short?rss=1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/lm.041277.115"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/learnmem.cshlp.org\/content\/23\/3\/108.full.pdf","pmid":"26884228","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Chunking improves symbolic sequence processing and relies on working memory gating mechanisms","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chunking-improves-symbolic-sequence-processing-relies-working-memory-gating-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":673116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":6874349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286447,"mean":10.364134538447,"rank":37138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":248913,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286447,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":532,"mean":7.6255969868173,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":532,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":13.580666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
