We performed a meta-analysis to provide an overview of the currently available evidence.\nPubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for relevant controlled studies. A random-effect model was used for pooled analysis of the effect of stem cell based therapy on bone mineral density (BMD). Stratified analyses were performed to explore the effect of study characteristics on the outcomes.\nPooled results from 12 preclinical studies (110 animals in stem cell treatment groups, and 106 animals in control groups) indicated that stem cell based treatment was associated with significantly improved BMD (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.84-1.74, P < 0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (Cochrane's Q test: P = 0.02, I2 = 45%) among the constituent studies. Implantation of bone marrow cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, adipose-derived stem cells, and human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells, were all associated with improved BMD as compared to that in the controls (P < 0.05 for all); the only exception being the use of embryonic stem cell transplantation (P > 0.05). Egger's test detected potential publication bias (P = 0.055); however, 'trim and fill' analysis yielded similar results after statistically incorporating the hypothetical studies in the analysis (SMD = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.32-2.16, P < 0.001).\nStem cell transplantation may improve BMD in animal models of osteoporosis. Our meta-analysis indicates a potential therapeutic role of stem cell based therapy for osteoporosis, and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Feng Li","Changlin Zhou","Liang Xu","Shuqing Tao","Jingyi Zhao","Qun Gu","Li, Feng","Zhou, Changlin","Xu, Liang","Tao, Shuqing","Zhao, Jingyi","Gu, Qun"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0149400","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T19:35:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1456577945,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0149400","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26882451"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0149400.PDF","pmid":"26882451","pubdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0149400","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effect of Stem Cell Therapy on Bone Mineral Density: A Meta-Analysis of Preclinical Studies in Animal Models of Osteoporosis","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-stem-cell-therapy-bone-mineral-density-metaanalysis-preclinical-studies-animal-models-osteopo-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7295661,"mean":6.3692208345751,"rank":471879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6821885,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7295661,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284580,"mean":10.280370456007,"rank":27950,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":256557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284580,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104912,"mean":10.107371009713,"rank":11177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":93698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104912,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5437,"mean":12.169577998528,"rank":596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":4840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5437,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
