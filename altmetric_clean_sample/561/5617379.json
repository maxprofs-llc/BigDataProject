Importantly, the link between UV irradiation and mTOR signaling has not been fully established. Apigenin is a naturally occurringflavonoid that has been shown to inhibit UV-induced skin cancer.Previously, we have demonstrated that apigenin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whichleads to suppression ofbasal mTOR activity in cultured keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrated that apigenin inhibited UVB-induced mTOR activation, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in mouse skin and in mouse epidermal keratinocytes. Interestingly, UVBinduced mTOR signalingviaPI3K\/Akt pathway, however,the inhibition of UVB-induced mTOR signaling by apigenin was not Akt-dependent. Instead, it was driven by AMPK activation.In addition, mTOR inhibition by apigenin in keratinocytes enhanced autophagy, which was responsible, at least in part, for the decreasedproliferation in keratinocytes. In contrast, apigenin did not alter UVB-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate the important role of mTOR inhibition in UVB protection by apigenin, and provide a new target and strategy for better prevention of UV-induced skin cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024cf","authors":["Bridgeman, Bryan B","Wang, Pu","Ye, Boping","Pelling, Jill C","Volpert, Olga V","Tong, Xin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cellsig.2016.02.008","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T13:16:22+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1873-3913"],"journal":"Cellular Signalling","last_mentioned_on":1455628565,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26876613?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26876613","pubdate":"2016-02-16T22:00:57+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Inhibition of mTOR by apigenin in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes: A new implication of skin cancer prevention","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-mtor-apigenin-uvbirradiated-keratinocytes-new-implication-skin-cancer-prevention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7200541,"mean":6.3358503237224,"rank":5418311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7200541,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284176,"mean":10.253479588282,"rank":198394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":46327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284176,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":723,"mean":2.0382520775623,"rank":458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":723,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.1379310344828,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
