The primary independent variable was muscle weakness as defined by the maximum Medsger muscle severity score and the outcome was disability as measured by the last recorded HAQ-DI. Univariate regression analyses were performed to assess association of HAQ-DI with the Medsger muscle severity score and other scleroderma characteristics. A multivariate regression was performed to determine whether an association existed between the degree of muscle weakness and disability, while controlling for confounders.\nIn 1718 patients with scleroderma, 22.8% (392\/1718) had muscle weakness as defined by the Medsger muscle severity score of\u2009\u2265\u20091. This subset was more likely than those without weakness to have diffuse cutaneous scleroderma (55.6% vs. 35.1%, p<0.0001), higher mRSS (16.3\u2009\u00b1\u200913.7 vs. 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.6, p<0.00001), shorter disease duration (5.21\u2009\u00b1\u20096.75 vs. 6.22\u2009\u00b1\u20097.67 years; p=0.02), synovitis (17.7% vs 11.4%, p=0.001), FVC<70% (46.2% vs. 30.6%, p=0.0001), and higher CK values (441\u2009\u00b1\u20091211 vs. 151\u2009\u00b1\u2009255, p=0.00001). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that for every unit of increase in the Medsger muscle severity score, there was a clinically significant (MID\u2009\u2265\u20090.14) increase in the mean HAQ-DI score at last follow-up visit.\nThe presence of muscle weakness associates with several features of worse disease burden and independently associates with disability as measured by the HAQ-DI.
