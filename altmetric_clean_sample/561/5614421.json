Insomnia, fatigue, and sleepiness are the most frequent sleep complaints after traumatic brain injury. Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and parasomnias may also occur after a head injury. In addition, depression, anxiety, and pain are common brain injury comorbidities with significant influence on sleep quality. Two types of traumatic brain injury that may negatively impact sleep are acceleration\/deceleration injuries causing generalized brain damage and contact injuries causing focal brain damage. Polysomnography, multiple sleep latency testing, and\/or actigraphy may be utilized to diagnose sleep disorders after a head injury. Depending on the disorder, treatment may include the use of medications, positive airway pressure, and\/or behavioral modifications. Unfortunately, the treatment of sleep disorders associated with traumatic brain injury may not improve neuropsychological function or sleepiness.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f6100082a9","authors":["Mari Viola-Saltzman","Camelia Musleh","Viola-Saltzman, Mari","Musleh, Camelia"],"doi":"10.2147\/ndt.s69105","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T01:02:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-2021","1176-6328"],"journal":"Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1505876374,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/traumatic-brain-injury-induced-sleep-disorders-peer-reviewed-article-NDT","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/traumatic-brain-injury-induced-sleep-disorders-peer-reviewed-article-NDT#?platform=hootsuite","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/traumatic-brain-injury-induced-sleep-disorders-peer-reviewed-article-NDT?utm_content=bufferf9baf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/traumatic-brain-injury-induced-sleep-disorders-peer-reviewed-article-NDT?utm_content=bufferd3907&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26929626?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4760657\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29003","pmid":"26929626","pubdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"339","title":"Traumatic brain injury-induced sleep disorders","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/traumatic-brain-injuryinduced-sleep-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24.6,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":368261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":8071843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291721,"mean":10.664254106677,"rank":19602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":272093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291721,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1617,"mean":5.2825556930693,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1569,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1617,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.5546197183099,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":19,"researcher":3,"practitioner":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":7,"Members of the public":19,"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
