We report a case of prolonged CPR. We have then reviewed all published cases with CPR duration equal to or more than 20 minutes. The objective was to determine the survival rate, the neurological outcome, and the characteristics of the survivors. Measurements and Main Results. The CPR data for 82 patients was reviewed. The median duration of CPR was 75 minutes. Patients mean age was 43 \u00b1 21 years with no significant comorbidities. The main causes of the cardiac arrests were myocardial infarction (29%), hypothermia (21%), and pulmonary emboli (12%). 74% of the arrests were witnessed, with a mean latency to CPR of 2 \u00b1 6 minutes and good quality chest compression provided in 96% of the cases. Adjunct therapy included extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (18%), thrombolysis (15.8%), and rewarming for hypothermia (19.5%). 83% were alive at 1 year, with full neurological recovery reported in 63 patients. Conclusion. Patients undergoing prolonged CPR can survive with good outcome. Young age, myocardial infarction, and potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest such as hypothermia and pulmonary emboli predict a favorable result, especially when the arrest is witnessed and followed by prompt and good resuscitative efforts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003b00","authors":["Youness, Houssein"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/7384649","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T04:45:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090-1305","2090-1313"],"journal":"Critical Care Research & Practice","last_mentioned_on":1455581021,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ccrp\/2016\/7384649\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ccrp\/2016\/7384649.pdf","pmid":"26885387","pubdate":"2016-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","startpage":"1","title":"Review and Outcome of Prolonged Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/review-outcome-prolonged-cardiopulmonary-resuscitation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7200541,"mean":6.3358503237224,"rank":6207361,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7200541,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284166,"mean":10.253778656766,"rank":237829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284166,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":6.8879555555556,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.02,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
