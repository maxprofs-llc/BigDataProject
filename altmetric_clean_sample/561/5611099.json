The program consisted of six group sessions combined with an eHealth module. Methods Semi-structured interviews with the first 31 consecutive participants of the intervention group participating in a randomized controlled trial. Participants were interviewed after their last group session. Semi-structured interviews were guided by an interview guide and audio-recorded. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and the emerging themes were discussed. All participants in the intervention group were asked about their experiences with a questionnaire at three (n\u00a0=\u00a058) and 12-months (n\u00a0=\u00a053) follow-up. Results Most participants appreciated the diversity of the program and benefited from the interaction with their peers. The eHealth module, although not used by everyone, was generally experienced as positive, especially the section with the physical exercises. Participants obtained more insight into their complaints and increased awareness, which contributed to the acceptance of and coping with the complaints. There was also criticism about the content of the program and the lack of a follow-up session. Results of the questionnaires showed that participants had a high level of satisfaction. Conclusions In general, the intervention fitted the needs of employees with CANS. Participants obtained more knowledge and insight into their complaints, as well as increased awareness; all this contributed to a behavioral change and improved coping. Many participants made changes at work and during their leisure time, whereas some felt that continuing their 'changed' behavior would be a challenge.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a79","authors":["Hutting, Nathan","Detaille, Sarah I","Heerkens, Yvonne F","Engels, Josephine A","Staal, J Bart","Nijhuis-van der Sanden, Maria W G"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10926-016-9630-9","first_seen_on":"2016-02-15T12:34:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-3688"],"journal":"Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation","last_mentioned_on":1455539672,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26875155?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26875155","pubdate":"2016-02-15T22:00:08+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Occupational Medicine\/Industrial Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Experiences of Participants in a Self-Management Program for Employees with Complaints of the Arm, Neck or Shoulder (CANS): A Mixed Methods Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/experiences-participants-selfmanagement-program-employees-complaints-arm-neck-shoulder-cans-mixed-me"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7196678,"mean":6.3286026753702,"rank":5415034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993090,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7196678,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322845,"mean":9.7386256210426,"rank":224365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322845,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":3.4678289962825,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.63,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
