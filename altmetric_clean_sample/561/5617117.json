The residue is placed in the coenzyme-binding domain and protects bound NAD+ from solvent. The effects of amino acid changes of the SEP on catalytic properties and thermal stability of PseFDH, SoyFDH, and CboFDH were compared. The strongest effect was observed for SoyFDH. All eight amino acid replacements resulted in increase in thermal stability, and in seven cases, increase in catalytic constant was achieved. Thermal stability of SoyFDH after mutations Phe290Asp and Phe290Glu increased 66- and 55-fold, respectively. KM values of the enzyme for substrate and coenzyme in different cases slightly increased or decreased. In case of one CboFDH, the mutein catalytic constant increased and thermal stability did not changed. In case of the second CboFDH mutant, results were the opposite. In one PseFDH mutant, amino acid change did not influence the catalytic constant, but in three others, the parameter was reduced. Two PseFDH mutants had higher and two mutants lower thermal stability in comparison with initial enzyme. Analysis of results of SEP mutagenesis in FDHs from bacterium, yeast, and plant shows that protein structure plays a key role for effect of the same amino acid changes in equivalent position in protein globule of formate dehydrogenases from different sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Tishkov, V I","Goncharenko, K V","Alekseeva, A A","Kleymenov, S Yu","Savin, S S"],"doi":"10.1134\/s0006297915130052","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T13:01:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1608-3040"],"issue":"13","journal":"Biochemistry (00062979)","last_mentioned_on":1455628330,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26878574?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26878574","pubdate":"2016-02-16T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Role of a Structurally Equivalent Phenylalanine Residue in Catalysis and Thermal Stability of Formate Dehydrogenases from Different Sources","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-structurally-equivalent-phenylalanine-residue-catalysis-thermal-stability-formate-dehydrogenase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7200541,"mean":6.3358503237224,"rank":3204851,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3834160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7200541,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284176,"mean":10.253467271927,"rank":127180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":147365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284176,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6405,"mean":2.6087663960025,"rank":4346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6405,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.0531967213115,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":83,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
