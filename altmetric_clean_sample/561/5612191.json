Cyano groups were removed from \u03b1-aminoacrylonitriles via treatment with sodium borohydride in 2-propanol in almost quantitative yields; a possible mechanism was proposed and examined using D-labeling experiments. A systematic study of the effects of the phenanthrene substitution pattern on the anticancer activity against three human cancer cell lines was discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Chi-Fen Chang"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b03395","first_seen_on":"2016-02-15T14:50:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1455547812,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b03395?ref=tw&hootPostID=4376cc70cc1ae48ddde4717677599e6b"],"pmid":"26836702","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cyano Group Removal from Cyano-Promoted Aza-Diels\u2013Alder Adducts: Synthesis and Structure\u2013Activity Relationship of Phenanthroindolizidines and Phenanthroquinolizidines","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cyano-group-removal-cyanopromoted-azadielsalder-adducts-synthesis-structureactivity-relationship-phe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7196678,"mean":6.3286026753702,"rank":5415045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7196678,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322846,"mean":9.7386217844472,"rank":224369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":53994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322846,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3585,"mean":3.3740323660714,"rank":2545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3585,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":1.9786423357664,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
