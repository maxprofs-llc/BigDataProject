This study was conducted to investigate if these late life changes were accompanied by epigenetic alterations.\nWestern blot analysis and RT-PCR were used to measure Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation regulators (DNMT1, DNMT3a, MeCP2, MAT2A) and histone proteins (H3K9Ac, H3K4me2, H3K27me3).\nCerebral levels of DNMT1 and MeCP2 were significantly reduced in mice exposed to Pb early in life, whereas the expression of DNMT3a was not altered. Levels of MAT2a were increased in the Pb-exposed mice across the lifespan. H3K9Ac and H3K4me2, involved in gene activation, were decreased, whereas the repressive mark H3K27me3 was elevated.\nEpigenetic modifiers are affected by the developmental exposure to Pb and may play a role in mediating the latent increases in AD-related proteins in the brain.","altmetric_jid":"55b0f02b2a83ee6a598b4578","authors":["Aseel Eid","Syed Waseem Bihaqi","William Renehan","Nasser H.
