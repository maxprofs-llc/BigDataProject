With the recent emergence of several high-throughput technologies including RNA sequencing, chromatin-immunoprecipitation-coupled sequencing, mass-spectrometry-based proteomics analyses, and the numerous variations of these strategies, investigations into cardiac development have been transformed from candidate-based studies into whole-genome, -transcriptome, and -proteome undertakings. In this review, we discuss several reports that have emerged from our laboratory and others over the past 5 years that emphasize the versatility of large dataset-based investigations of cardiogenic transcription factors, from phenotypic validations and new gene implications to the identification of novel roles of well-studied transcriptional regulators.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ad","authors":["Slagle, Christopher E","Conlon, Frank L","Christopher E.
