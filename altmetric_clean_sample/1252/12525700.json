Based on sequence similarity with other fungal lipases, FSL2 contains a catalytic triad, consisting of Ser144, Asp198, and His256. FSL2 cDNA was subcloned into the pGAPZ\u03b1A vector containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae \u03b1-factor signal sequence and this construct was used to transform Pichia pastoris and achieve a high-level extracellular production of a FSL2 lipase. Maximum lipase activity was observed after 48h. The optimum activity of the purified recombinant enzyme was measured at pH 8.0-9.0 and 37\u00b0C. FSL2 is remarkably stable at alkaline pH values up to 12 and at temperatures below 40\u00b0C. It has high catalytic efficiency towards triglycerides with short to long chain fatty acids but with a marked preference for medium and long chain fatty acids. FSL2 activity is decreased at sodium taurodeoxycholate concentrations above the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of this anionic detergent. However, lipase activity is enhanced by Ca(2+) and inhibited by EDTA or Cu(2+) and partially by Mg(2+) or K(+). In silico docking of medium chain triglycerides, monogalctolipids (MGDG), digalactolipids (DGDG) and long chain phospholipids in the active site of FSL2 reveals structural solutions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b27","authors":["Jalouli, Raida","Parsiegla, Goetz","Carri\u00e8re, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","Gargouri, Youssef","Bezzine, Sofiane"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijbiomac.2016.09.030","endpage":"71","first_seen_on":"2016-10-10T03:28:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0003","01418130"],"issue":"Pt A","journal":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","last_mentioned_on":1476070123,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0141813016315690&_version=1&md5=bf113c40b239906494fe7acf9894021b"],"pmid":"27620466","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"61","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Efficient heterologous expression of Fusarium solani lipase, FSL2, in Pichia pastoris, functional characterization of the recombinant enzyme and molecular modeling","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-heterologous-expression-fusarium-solani-lipase-fsl2-pichia-pastoris-functional-characteriz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7520778,"mean":6.5030037002784,"rank":5693031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1006093,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7520778,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239635,"mean":12.453404583657,"rank":167121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239635,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":1.4884958677686,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.6423076923077,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
