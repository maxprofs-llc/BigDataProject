The new criteria are as follows: 1) morning stiffness in and around joints lasting at least 1 hour before maximal improvement; 2) soft tissue swelling (arthritis) of 3 or more joint areas observed by a physician; 3) swelling (arthritis) of the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, or wrist joints; 4) symmetric swelling (arthritis); 5) rheumatoid nodules; 6) the presence of rheumatoid factor; and 7) radiographic erosions and\/or periarticular osteopenia in hand and\/or wrist joints. Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks. Rheumatoid arthritis is defined by the presence of 4 or more criteria, and no further qualifications (classic, definite, or probable) or list of exclusions are required. In addition, a \"classification tree\" schema is presented which performs equally as well as the traditional (4 of 7) format. The new criteria demonstrated 91-94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for RA when compared with non-RA rheumatic disease control subjects.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000231f","first_seen_on":"2011-10-07T01:42:06+00:00","issns":["0004-3591"],"issue":"3","journal":"Arthritis & Rheumatism","last_mentioned_on":1368969019,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3358796"],"pmid":"3358796","pubdate":"1988-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"The American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for the classification of rheumatoid arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/american-rheumatism-association-1987-revised-criteria-classification-rheumatoid-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":804785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3696352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66455,"mean":4.5194189665031,"rank":11392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":54900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66455,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1790,"mean":3.8203610955841,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":1486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1790,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.3875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":10,"Professor > Associate Professor":31,"Librarian":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":57,"Researcher":105,"Student  > Ph.
