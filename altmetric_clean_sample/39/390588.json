Modification of thermosensitivity by treatment with PTL prior to hyperthermia was investigated in the human prostate cancer androgen-independent cell lines PC3 and DU145. In addition, we analyzed the mechanisms related to induction of apoptosis or G\u2082\/M cell-cycle arrest via the effects of ERK1\/2, p38 and SAPK\/JNK signaling on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Lethal damage caused by mild hyperthermia at 41.0\u02daC or 42.0\u02daC in both cell lines resulted in a low level of thermosensitivity, while sequential combination with PTL showed significant thermosensitization. Step-up hyperthermia (SUH) (42\u02daC for 30 min, 43.0\u02daC or 43.5\u02daC for various periods) reduced the thermosensitivity of the cells to second heating. However, PTL given as pre-treatment prior to SUH prevented SUH-induced thermal tolerance and resulted in significant thermosensitization. Induction of apoptosis by the combination of PTL and hyperthermia at 44.0\u02daC was determined by the ratio of sub-G1 division cells using flow cytometry, which was increased significantly in comparison with single treatment, and was more effective in PC3 than DU145 cells. The behavior of ERK1\/2, p38, and SAPK\/JNK signaling in the MAPK cascade by treatment with PTL and hyperthermia were examined by Western blotting. As for PC3 cells, ras-downstream p-ERK1\/2 was activated and p-p38 slightly activated by combined treatment with PTL and hyperthermia in comparison with each alone. As for DU145 cells, ERK1\/2 was not changed, while p38 and SAPK\/JNK were slightly activated by combination treatment. These results were related to increases in the induction of apoptosis, G\u2082\/M cell cycle arrest, and lethal damage of cells via the MAPK cascade. Together, our findings demonstrate that PTL is an effective thermosensitizing agent for multidisciplinary therapy for human prostate cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f61000795e","doi":"10.3892\/ijmm.2011.760","first_seen_on":"2011-10-03T19:51:10+00:00","issns":["1791-244X"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1317670079,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21805026?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21805026","pubdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Thermosensitization and induction of apoptosis or cell-cycle arrest             via the MAPK cascade by parthenolide, an NF-\u03baB inhibitor, in human prostate cancer             androgen-independent cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thermosensitization-induction-apoptosis-cellcycle-arrest-via-mapk-cascade-parthenolide-nfb-inhibitor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2327899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1535230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65957,"mean":4.4393778882891,"rank":27365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":28628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65957,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":779,"mean":1.5736915167095,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":779,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.645,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
