Head injury was sustained by 4\/114 (4%) of helmet wearers compared with 100\/928 (11%) of non-wearers (P = 0.023). Significantly more children wore helmets (50\/309 (16%)) than did adults (64\/731 (9%)) (P < 0.001). The incidence of head injuries sustained in accidents involving motor vehicles (52\/288 (18%)) was significantly higher than in those not involving motor vehicles (52\/754 (7%)) (chi 2 = 28.9, P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis of probability of sustaining a head injury showed that only two variables were significant: helmet use and involvement of a motor vehicle. Mutually adjusted odds ratios showed a risk factor of 2.95 (95% confidence interval 1.95 to 4.47, P < 0.0001) for accidents involving a motor vehicle and a protective factor of 3.25 (1.17 to 9.06, P = 0.024) for wearing a helmet.\nThe findings suggest an increased risk of sustaining head injury in a bicycle accident when a motor vehicle is involved and confirm protective effect of helmet wearing for any bicycle accident.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["C Maimaris","C L Summer","C Browning","C R Palmer","Maimaris, C","Summers, C L","Browning, C","Palmer, C R"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.308.6943.1537","endpage":"1540","first_seen_on":"2011-10-12T10:56:25+00:00","issns":["1468-5833","0959-8138"],"issue":"6943","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1430438400,"links":["http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/308\/6943\/1537.full?sid=582aa1ea-4fad-480e-bdb0-1b24c0f853c6","http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/308\/6943\/1537","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.308.6943.1537"],"pmcid":"PMC2540472","pmid":"8019309","pubdate":"1994-06-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1537","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Injury patterns in cyclists attending an accident and emergency department: a comparison of helmet wearers and non-wearers","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/bmj.308.6943.1537","volume":"308","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/injury-patterns-cyclists-attending-accident-emergency-department-comparison-helmet-wearers-nonwearer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083342,"mean":6.8946797770799,"rank":610506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7471704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083342,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83319,"mean":5.4893646991046,"rank":6047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":77256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83319,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33823,"mean":23.107212169594,"rank":9271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":24543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33823,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":671,"mean":8.3451850746269,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":671,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
