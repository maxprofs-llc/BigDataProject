Self-report methods are also rarely used, despite the growing evidence for its use in mild-to-moderate dementia and the lack of concordance between self-reports and proxy reports of well-being. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between one aspect of well-being, purpose in life, and one of its predictors, goal pursuit, while employing the self-report of individuals with dementia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fac","doi":"10.1093\/geronb\/gbq092","first_seen_on":"2011-10-04T18:40:42+00:00","issns":["1758-5368"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences & Social Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1318612020,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21187337"],"pmid":"21187337","pubdate":"2011-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Sociology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences","geriatrics","psychology"],"title":"Self-reported goal pursuit and purpose in life among people with dementia.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selfreported-goal-pursuit-purpose-life-among-people-dementia-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":633283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3865984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66123,"mean":4.4998063881915,"rank":9252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":56772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66123,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":435,"mean":5.0730967741935,"rank":77,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":435,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.4333333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
