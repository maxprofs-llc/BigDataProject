Although there are cogent arguments that indirect medical education expenses have decreased over the past 25 years, there is also a reasonable expectation that direct medical education expenses, such as those related to resident salaries, faculty involvement, administration of programs, and overhead costs, have increased. Our current system of GME financing is complex and cumbersome and relies almost exclusively on government support. This article examines the adequacy of current funding, focusing on the economics of the entire system rather than individual hospitals, states, or regions. It also recommends reexamining GME financing and considering options that ensure appropriate levels of government support and participation of other health care insurers to adequately fund GME.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000227a","doi":"10.1059\/0003-4819-155-7-201110040-00008","first_seen_on":"2011-10-05T15:17:51+00:00","issns":["1539-3704"],"issue":"7","journal":"Annals of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1347586388,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21969344?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21969344","pubdate":"2011-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Threats to graduate medical education funding and the need for a rational approach: a statement from the alliance for academic internal medicine.","type":"article","volume":"155","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threats-graduate-medical-education-funding-need-rational-approach-statement-alliance-academic-intern"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":1929639,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2536595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66042,"mean":4.5940828273345,"rank":22319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":43005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66042,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4950,"mean":17.307570014144,"rank":3371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4950,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":8.3910819672131,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":4,"Social Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"BA":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"PE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/nursefriendly\/statuses\/246421289944879104","license":"public","rt":["Kind4Kids"],"citation_ids":[392693],"posted_on":"2012-09-14T01:33:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Andrew Lopez, RN","url":"http:\/\/www.nurseup.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/854679263932334080\/EzXKHhCt_normal.jpg","description":"Registered Nurse, Nurse Entrepreneur, Social Media Consultant,#Healthcare #Tweetchat #Enthusiast, Ask us :)","id_on_source":"nursefriendly","tweeter_id":"22638297","geo":{"lt":40.16706,"ln":-74.49987,"country":"US"},"followers":14611},"tweet_id":"246421289944879104"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmleschool\/statuses\/220183288495616000","license":"public","citation_ids":[392693],"posted_on":"2012-07-03T15:52:41+00:00","author":{"name":"John","url":"http:\/\/medjournal.net","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1536204688\/Stethoscope-2_normal.png","description":"We provide medical news and multiple choice quizzes for self - assessment.","id_on_source":"usmleschool","tweeter_id":"370861753","followers":2368},"tweet_id":"220183288495616000"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tomheston\/statuses\/220275133733023744","license":"public","citation_ids":[392693],"posted_on":"2012-07-03T21:57:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","url":"http:\/\/tomheston.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/452650157050302464\/-kGG7sgd_normal.png","description":"I help people make wise health decisions.
