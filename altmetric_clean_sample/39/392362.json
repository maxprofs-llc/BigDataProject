Over the course of the past decade, the Excel program has undergone a series of revisions that make the Carr and Burkholder paper somewhat difficult to follow with newer versions. The present article provides task analyses for constructing various types of commonly used single-subject design graphs in Microsoft Excel 2007. The task analyses were evaluated using a between-subjects design that compared the graphing skills of 22 behavior-analytic graduate students using Excel 2007 and either the Carr and Burkholder or newly developed task analyses. Results indicate that the new task analyses yielded more accurate and faster graph construction than the Carr and Burkholder instructions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c8c","doi":"10.1901\/jaba.2009.42-277","first_seen_on":"2011-10-05T09:29:56+00:00","issns":["1938-3703"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1410164906,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19949515","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2695331\/?report=reader"],"pmid":"19949515","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"CREATING SINGLE-SUBJECT DESIGN GRAPHS IN MICROSOFT EXCELTM 2007","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/creating-singlesubject-design-graphs-microsoft-exceltm-2007"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":1007662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2929117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66043,"mean":4.594559886133,"rank":14365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":48813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66043,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":622,"mean":6.9736296296295,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":622,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":16,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":15,"Student  > Ph.
