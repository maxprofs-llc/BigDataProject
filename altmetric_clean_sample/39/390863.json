In untargeted metabolomics, the measured mass of a detected compound is used to define the location of the compound in chemical space, but uncertainties in mass measurements lead to \"degeneracies\" in chemical space since multiple chemical formulae correspond to the same measured mass. We compare two methods to eliminate these degeneracies. One method relies on natural isotopic abundances, and the other relies on the use of stable-isotope labeling (SIL) to directly determine C and N atom counts. Both depend on combinatorial explorations of the \"chemical space\" comprised of all possible chemical formulae comprised of biologically relevant chemical elements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-12-s1-s6","first_seen_on":"2011-10-03T23:23:10+00:00","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"Suppl 1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1435844832,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/12\/S1\/S6","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/12\/S1\/S6#B12"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-12-s1-s6.pdf","pmid":"21810208","pubdate":"2011-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"S6","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Improved genome annotation through untargeted detection of pathway-specific metabolites","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improved-genome-annotation-through-untargeted-detection-pathwayspecific-metabolites"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5307915,"mean":6.2288636865635,"rank":1957063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3325212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5307915,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69179,"mean":5.1098129752233,"rank":20229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":48610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69179,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4767,"mean":3.8565060847671,"rank":1724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4767,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.6308666666667,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Ph.
