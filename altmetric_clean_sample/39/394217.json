In transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the free energy of TRS-L and cTRS-B (complement of TRS-B) duplex formation is one of the factors regulating the transcription of sgmRNAs. In addition, N gene sgmRNA transcription is controlled by a transcription-regulating motif, including a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between complementary proximal and distal elements. The extension of complementarity between these two sequences increased N gene transcription. An active domain, a novel essential component of the transcription-regulating motif, has been identified. The active domain primary sequence was necessary for its activity. Relocation of the active domain upstream of the N gene TRS core sequence in the absence of the proximal and distal elements also enhanced sgmRNA N transcription. According to the proposed working model for N gene transcriptional activation, the long-distance RNA-RNA interaction relocates the distant active domain in close proximity with the N gene TRS, which probably increases the frequency of template switching during the synthesis of negative RNA. The transcription-regulating motif has been optimized to a minimal sequence showing a 4-fold activity increase in relation to the native RNA motif. Full-length TGEV infectious viruses were generated with the optimized transcription-regulating motif, which enhanced by 5-fold the transcription of the 3a gene and can be used in expression vectors based in coronavirus genomes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f92","authors":["P.
