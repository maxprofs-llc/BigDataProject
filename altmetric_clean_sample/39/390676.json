The stimulation of myogenesis by IGF-I (30 nmol\/l) was manifested by an enhanced myoblast fusion and expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) during the first 3 days of differentiation. IGF-I-dependent fusion and MHC expression was reduced by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Both cytokines prevented the stimulatory effect of IGF-I on MyoD expression with minor modification of the myogenin level. Both TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma activated the expression of cyclin A in myoblasts restimulated to proliferation; however, when used in combination with IGF-I these cytokines prevented the rise in cyclin A induced by growth factor. In conclusion: i) TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reduce IGF-I-dependent myogenesis which was manifested by the reduction of myoblast fusion and MHC cellular levels, ii) Molecular mechanisms of inhibitory action of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma on IGF-I-mediated differentiation involve a decrease in MyoD whereas myogenin level plays a minor role, iii) TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma increase the proliferative potential of myoblasts; however, they reduced the mitogenic effect of IGF-I, manifested by a decrease of IGF-I-stimulated cyclin A expression in myoblasts reinduced to proliferation. Interactions among IGF-I and proinflammatory cytokines are therefore important to establish a number of myoblasts and the onset of myogenesis during muscle regeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008568","first_seen_on":"2011-10-03T20:53:02+00:00","issns":["1505-1773"],"issue":"3","journal":"Polish Journal of Veterinary Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1317673370,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21957736?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21957736","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Growth factor and cytokine interactions in myogenesis.
