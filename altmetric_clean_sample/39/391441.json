PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"Eicosanoids, including PGE-2 and 5-HETE, can increase levels of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Overexpression of COX-2 or 5-LOX increases levels of PGE-2 and 5-HETE, respectively. Elevated levels of VEGF are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We prospectively measured VEGF in serum collected from patients enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30203, a randomized phase II study of eicosanoid modulation in addition to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, to determine whether these levels had prognostic significance and whether they correlated with COX-2 expression and\/or responded to inhibition of COX-2 or 5-LOX.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efc","authors":["Edelman MJ","Hodgson L","Wang X","Christenson R","Jewell S","Vokes E","Kratzke R","Martin J.
