These volunteers created a shared vocabulary of 661 terms, linking these terms to each other and to a pre-existing upper ontology by adding 245 hyponym relationships and 340 synonym relationships. While ontology-building has proved to be an expensive and labor-intensive process using most existing methodologies, the rudimentary ontology constructed in this study was composed in only two days at a cost of only 3 t-shirts, 4 coffee mugs, and one chocolate moose. The protocol used to create and evaluate this ontology involved a targeted, web-based interface. The design and implementation of this protocol is discussed along with quantitative and qualitative assessments of the constructed ontology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9243cf058f61000dbac","first_seen_on":"2011-10-04T16:00:15+00:00","issns":["1793-5091"],"journal":"Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing","last_mentioned_on":1317742609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17094234"],"pmid":"17094234","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Citeseer","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Fast, cheap and out of control: a zero curation model for ontology development.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-cheap-control-zero-curation-model-ontology-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.32,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.32},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7088931,"mean":6.2940412843656,"rank":831564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6257358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7088931,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77712,"mean":5.275912805137,"rank":9424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":68288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77712,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":2.9511619047619,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":97,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
