An effective gene mention tagger is deemed unnecessary because the subsequent steps will filter out false positives and high recall is sufficient. However, unlike similar tasks in the past BioCreative challenges, the BioCreative III GN task is particularly challenging because it is not species-specific. Required to process full-length articles, an ineffective gene mention tagger may produce a huge number of ambiguous false positives that overwhelm subsequent filtering steps while still missing many true positives.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Cheng-Ju Kuo","Maurice HT Ling","Chun-Nan Hsu","Kuo CJ","Ling MH","Hsu CN"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-12-s8-s6","first_seen_on":"2011-10-04T12:28:55+00:00","issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"Suppl 8","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1317732719,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/12\/S8\/S6"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-12-s8-s6.pdf","pmid":"22152021","pubdate":"2011-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"S6","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Soft tagging of overlapping high confidence gene mention variants for cross-species full-text gene normalization","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-12-S8-S6","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soft-tagging-overlapping-high-confidence-gene-mention-variants-crossspecies-fulltext-gene-normalizat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1987586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66122,"mean":4.6175906293008,"rank":23373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":40434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66122,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":4.4215190926276,"rank":1533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":3.38616,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
