Here we demonstrate that Tregs are unable to modulate the spontaneous production of TNF-\u03b1 from RA synovial cells cultured from the diseased synovium site. Cytokine (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) activated T cells (Tck), cells we previously demonstrated to mimic the effector function of pathogenic RA synovial T cells, contained Tregs that survived and divided in this cytokine environment; however, the up-regulation of key molecules associated with Treg function (CTLA-4 and LFA-1) was impaired. Furthermore, Tregs were unable to suppress the function of Tcks, including contact-dependent induction of TNF-\u03b1 from macrophages, supporting the concept that impaired Treg function\/responsiveness contributes to chronicity of RA. However, ectopic foxp3 expression in both Tcks and pathogenic RA synovial T cells attenuated their cytokine production and function, including contact-dependent activation of macrophages. This diminished response to cytokine activation after ectopic foxp3 expression involved inhibited NF-\u03baB activity and differed mechanistically from that displayed endogenously in conventional Tregs. These results suggest that diseases such as RA may perpetuate owing to the inability of Tregs to control cytokine-activated T-cell function. Understanding the mechanism whereby foxp3 attenuates the pathogenic function of synovial T cells may provide insight into the mechanisms of chronicity in inflammatory disease and potentially reveal new therapeutic candidates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011PNAS..10816717B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Paul A.
