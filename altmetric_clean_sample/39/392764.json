For training, 32 fully and 500 partially annotated articles were prepared. A total of 507 articles were selected as the test set. Due to the high annotation cost, it was not feasible to obtain gold-standard human annotations for all test articles. Instead, we developed an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm approach for choosing a small number of test articles for manual annotation that were most capable of differentiating team performance. Moreover, the same algorithm was subsequently used for inferring ground truth based solely on team submissions. We report team performance on both gold standard and inferred ground truth using a newly proposed metric called Threshold Average Precision (TAP-k).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Lu Z","Kao HY","Wei CH","Huang M","Liu J","Kuo CJ","Hsu CN","Tsai RT","Dai HJ","Okazaki N","Cho HC","Gerner M","Solt I","Agarwal S","Liu F","Vishnyakova D","Ruch P","Romacker M","Rinaldi F","Bhattacharya S","Srinivasan P","Liu H","Torii M","Matos S","Campos D","Verspoor K","Livingston KM","Wilbur WJ","Zhiyong Lu","Hung-Yu Kao","Chih-Hsuan Wei","Minlie Huang","Jingchen Liu","Cheng-Ju Kuo","Chun-Nan Hsu","Richard Tsai","Hong-Jie Dai","Naoaki Okazaki","Han-Cheol Cho","Martin Gerner","Illes Solt","Shashank Agarwal","Feifan Liu","Dina Vishnyakova","Patrick Ruch","Martin Romacker","Fabio Rinaldi","Sanmitra Bhattacharya","Padmini Srinivasan","Hongfang Liu","Manabu Torii","Sergio Matos","David Campos","Karin Verspoor","Kevin M Livingston","W Wilbur"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-12-s8-s2","first_seen_on":"2011-10-05T16:06:29+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["","1471-2105"],"issue":"Suppl 8","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1346407834,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/12\/S8\/S2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22151901?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-12-s8-s2.pdf","pmid":"22151901","pubdate":"2011-10-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"S2","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"The gene normalization task in BioCreative III.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2105-12-S8-S2","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gene-normalization-task-biocreative-iii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1988807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66042,"mean":4.6143328538332,"rank":23306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":40436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66042,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2646,"mean":4.4215190926276,"rank":1534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2646,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":3.3494933333333,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
