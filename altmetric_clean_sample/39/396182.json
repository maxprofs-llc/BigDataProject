To elucidate these processes the gene expression profile of the cerebral cortex from untreated and intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy treated fucosidosis pups and age-matched unaffected controls were examined. Neuroinflammation and cell death processes were identified to have a major role in fucosidosis pathophysiology with 37% of differentially expressed (DE) genes involved in these processes. Critical, specific, early decreases in expression levels of key genes in myelin assembly were identified by gene expression profiling, including myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL), and oligodendrocyte myelin paranodal and inner loop protein (OPALIN). These gene expression changes may be indicative of early neuronal loss causing reduced electrical impulses required for oligodendrocyte maturation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Fletcher JL","Kondagari GS","Wright AL","Thomson PC","Williamson P","Taylor RM","Jessica L.
