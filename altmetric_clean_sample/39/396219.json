As subjects viewed sound-implying, but silent, visual stimuli, activity in auditory cortex differentiated among sounds related to various animals, musical instruments and objects. These results support the idea that early sensory cortex activity reflects perceptual experience, rather than sensory stimulation alone.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f610003167","authors":["Kaspar Meyer","Jonas T Kaplan","Ryan Essex","Cecelia Webber","Hanna Damasio","Antonio Damasio"],"doi":"10.1038\/nn.2533","endpage":"668","first_seen_on":"2011-10-08T07:53:16+00:00","issns":["1097-6256","1546-1726"],"journal":"Nature Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1421662368,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/neuro\/journal\/v13\/n6\/full\/nn.2533.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20436482","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nn.2533"],"pmid":"20436482","pubdate":"2010-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"667","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Predicting visual stimuli on the basis of activity in auditory cortices","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predicting-visual-stimuli-basis-activity-auditory-cortices"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5437067,"mean":6.3287073097895,"rank":950932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":4481452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5437067,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69999,"mean":5.0820804308694,"rank":11572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":58307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69999,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3082,"mean":24.499279454722,"rank":1519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3082,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":21.77104109589,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":31,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":111,"Student  > Doctoral Student":19,"Student  > Ph.
