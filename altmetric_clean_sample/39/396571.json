Optimized compounds 22a (SERT, NET, DAT, IC(50) = 20, 109, 430 nM), 23a (SERT, NET, DAT, IC(50) = 29, 85, 168 nM), and 26a (SERT, NET, DAT, IC(50) = 53, 150, 140 nM) were highly brain penetrant, active in vivo in the mouse tail suspension test at 10 and 30 mpk PO, and were not generally motor stimulants at doses ranging from 1 to 30 mpk PO. Moderate in vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP) and potassium ion channel Kv11.1 (hERG) inhibition were uncovered as potential liabilities for the chemical series.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","doi":"10.1021\/jm101312a","first_seen_on":"2011-10-08T19:13:47+00:00","issns":["1520-4804"],"issue":"15","journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1347802427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21739935?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jm101312a","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21739935"],"pmid":"21739935","pubdate":"2011-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and pharmacological characterization of bicyclic triple reuptake inhibitor 3-aryl octahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrrole analogues.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-pharmacological-characterization-bicyclic-triple-reuptake-inhibitor-3aryl-octahydrocyclope-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":769918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2838136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63318,"mean":4.0512120599523,"rank":11713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":51104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63318,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2707,"mean":3.3872158167036,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2707,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":3.4253333333333,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
