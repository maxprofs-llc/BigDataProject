In this review, authors focused on the usage of photography in gross and clinical anatomy. Photography in gross and clinical anatomy is not only essential for accurate documentation of morphological findings but also important in sharing knowledge and experience. Photographs of cadavers are supposed to demonstrate the required information clearly. Thus, photographs should be taken with certain techniques in order to obtain high quality and standardization. Camera, lens, lighting, background, and certain photographic techniques are among the factors to achieve precise images. A set of suggested guidelines for accomplishing these standards are given for anatomists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069c5","doi":"10.1002\/ase.247","first_seen_on":"2011-10-06T09:41:35+00:00","issns":["1935-9780"],"journal":"Anatomical Sciences Education","last_mentioned_on":1311957925,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21796798"],"pmid":"21796798","pubdate":"2011-07-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education","anatomy"],"title":"Guidelines for standard photography in gross and clinical anatomy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/guidelines-standard-photography-gross-clinical-anatomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2018338,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63436,"mean":4.1251171435327,"rank":25693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":27267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63436,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":2.576786407767,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":108,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.65,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
