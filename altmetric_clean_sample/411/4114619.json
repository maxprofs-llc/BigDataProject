It is important for patients to have a treatment option that may provide rapid relief from \"off\" episodes. In three pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, subcutaneous apomorphine was effective in acutely treating \"off\" episodes, significantly improving Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor scores and reducing the number of \"off\" hours per day, with a significantly shorter time to patient-declared onset of relief than placebo. Thus, clinical trial data support the efficacy of intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine as a rapid acute treatment for \"off\" episodes in advanced PD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003296","authors":["Stacy, Mark","Silver, Dee","Mark Stacy","Dee Silver"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.parkreldis.2007.07.016","endpage":"92","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T12:34:49+00:00","issns":["1353-8020","13538020"],"issue":"2","journal":"Parkinsonism & Related Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1430760931,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.parkreldis.2007.07.016"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.prd-journal.com\/article\/S1353802007001277\/pdf","pmid":"18083605","pubdate":"2008-01-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"85","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Apomorphine for the acute treatment of \u201coff\u201d episodes in Parkinson's disease","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1353802007001277","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/apomorphine-acute-treatment-episodes-parkinsons-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5056368,"mean":5.9809452245076,"rank":1246413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3216102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5056368,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172507,"mean":8.6463144586277,"rank":54887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":114483,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172507,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":818,"mean":2.7698041615667,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":818,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.9975,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
