Early and effective treatment based on the knowledge of causative micro-organisms and their antimicrobial sensitivity ensures prompt clinical recovery and possible complications can thus be avoided.\nThe aim of this study was to isolate the organisms associated with CSOM and to detect the antibiogram of the aerobic isolates.\nA total of 204 patients clinically diagnosed of CSOM were enrolled in the study and the samples were obtained from each patient using sterile cotton swabs and cultured for microbial flora. Drug susceptibility testing for aerobic isolates was conducted using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method.\nThe most common causative organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (48.69%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.89%) amongst the 191 aerobic isolates. Anaerobes accounted for 29.41% of the isolates while 12.25% were fungi. Antimicrobial profile of aerobic isolates revealed maximum sensitivity to amikacin (95.5%), ceftriaxone (83.4%) and gentamicin (82.7%).\nKnowing the etiological agents of CSOM and their antimicrobial susceptibility is of essential importance for an efficient treatment, prevention of both complications and development of antibiotic resistance and finally, the reduction of the treatment costs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f6100042af","authors":["Rajat Prakash","Deepak Juyal","Vikrant Negi","Shekhar Pal","Shamanth Adekhandi","Munesh Sharma","Neelam Sharma"],"doi":"10.4103\/1947-2714.110436","first_seen_on":"2015-06-07T21:59:17+00:00","issns":["2250-1541"],"issue":"4","journal":"North American Journal of Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1433714316,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3662095\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3662095","pmid":"23724403","pubdate":"2013-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","startpage":"282","title":"Microbiology of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media in a Tertiary Care Setup of Uttarakhand State, India","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbiology-chronic-suppurative-otitis-media-tertiary-care-setup-uttarakhand-state-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5199662,"mean":6.133441503593,"rank":4328623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5199662,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175982,"mean":8.6902509020862,"rank":143668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175982,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":4.161429787234,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.0961538461538,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
