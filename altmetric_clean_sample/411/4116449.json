A cell suspension is transferred to a microwell chip containing 6400 microwells, each microwell with a single 5 \u03bcm pore in the bottom. The fluid enters the microwell and drags a cell onto the pore. After a cell has landed onto the pore, it will stop the fluid flow through this microwell. The remaining fluid and cells will be diverted to the next available microwell. This results in a fast and efficient distribution of single cells in individual microwells. After identification by fluorescence microscopy, the cells of interest are isolated from the microwell by punching the bottom together with the cell. The overall single cell recovery of seeding followed by isolation of the single cell, is >70% with a specificity of 100% as confirmed by the genetic make-up of the isolated cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ac","authors":["Joost F.
