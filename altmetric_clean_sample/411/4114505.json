The patterns of instability of the enzyme to changes in temperature and pH were found to parallel closely those of the antilymphoma agent. L-Asparaginase activity was essentially absent from the serum of newborn guinea pigs and this failed to inhibit 6C3HED cells. On separating guinea pig serum proteins by salt precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography on DEAE cellulose, antilymphoma activity was found only in fractions which contained L-asparaginase.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["BROOME, J D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T12:21:16+00:00","issns":["0022-1007"],"journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1338420061,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14015821"],"pmcid":"PMC2137570","pmid":"14015821","pubdate":"1963-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Evidence that the L-asparaginase of guinea pig serum is responsible for its antilymphoma effects.
