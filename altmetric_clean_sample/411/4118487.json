J., D. C. Dawson, and S. A. Ernst. Am J. Physiol. 249 (Cell Physiol. 18): C41-C47, 1985]. To establish the ionic basis for the Isc, transmural fluxes of 22Na and 36Cl were measured. Under short-circuit conditions there was little net flux of either ion in the absence of agonists. Addition of carbachol elevated net serosal-to-mucosal Cl flux to 1.71 mu eq.h-1.cm-2, whereas a smaller increase to 0.85 mu eq.h-1.cm-2 occurred with isoproterenol. Neither agonist altered net Na flux. The stimulated Isc accounted for 70% of the net Cl flux induced by carbachol and nearly 100% of that induced by isoproterenol. Replacement of Cl by gluconate or Na by choline abolished (carbachol) or greatly reduced (isoproterenol) the Isc, which could be restored in a dose-dependent fashion by ion restitution. Active ion transport was preferentially inhibited by basal (vs. apical) addition of ouabain, furosemide, or barium. The results provide evidence that cholinergic and beta-adrenergic agonists elicit active transmural Cl secretion. They further suggest that transport is dependent on the Na+-K+-adenosine-triphosphatase, a Na-Cl cotransport process, and a basal K conductance, all features of a secondary active Cl secretory mechanism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220c","authors":["Lowy, R J","Dawson, D C","Ernst, S A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T22:43:50+00:00","issns":["0002-9513"],"issue":"6 Pt 2","journal":"American Journal of Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1425612082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2735444"],"pmid":"2735444","pubdate":"1989-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Mechanism of ion transport by avian salt gland primary cell cultures.","type":"article","volume":"256","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanism-ion-transport-avian-salt-gland-primary-cell-cultures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840066,"mean":5.7743542592945,"rank":1179527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3069072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840066,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167467,"mean":8.5769219304219,"rank":53329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":111070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167467,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":459,"mean":5.2917379912664,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":459,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
