Higher percentages of HIV testing in the past year were seen for persons aged 15-34 compared with those aged 35-44, and for non-Hispanic black persons compared with other race and ethnicity groups. Four of 10 males who had same-sex sexual contact in the past year had been tested for HIV in the past year, compared with 2 of 10 who had opposite-sex sexual contact in the past year. Levels of HIV testing in the past year were higher for persons with behaviors that increase HIV risk, including having one or more same-sex partners or higher numbers of opposite-sex sexual partners in the past year.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccba","authors":["Copen, Casey E","Chandra, Anjani","Febo-Vazquez, Isaedmarie"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T02:58:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1941-4927"],"issue":"202","journal":"NCHS data brief","last_mentioned_on":1433732283,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26046825?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26046825","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"HIV Testing in the Past Year Among the U.S. Household Population Aged 15-44: 2011-2013.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hiv-testing-past-year-among-household-population-aged-1544-20112013"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5204448,"mean":6.1397495691689,"rank":3662083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":871665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5204448,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176109,"mean":8.700047993277,"rank":124485,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176109,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"mean":5.0601481481481,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HealthTrendster\/status\/607743363362619392","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4112892],"posted_on":"2015-06-08T02:58:03+00:00","author":{"name":"HealthTrendster","url":"http:\/\/www.startuphealth.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000822442908\/fd840099eafde50ce686f64eb687ca6d_normal.png","description":"Follow @UnityStoakes for the latest @StartUpHealth and #digitalhealth news!","id_on_source":"HealthTrendster","tweeter_id":"127875042","geo":{"lt":40.71427,"ln":-74.00597,"country":"US"},"followers":1253},"tweet_id":"607743363362619392"}]}}
