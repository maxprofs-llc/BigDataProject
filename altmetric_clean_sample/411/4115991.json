CLA has been shown to have strong inhibitory effects on mammary carcinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the regulation of human stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD, EC 1.14.99.5) expression by CLA in human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Treatment of the cells with the cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomers (45 microM) did not repress SCD mRNA in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. However, the cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomers significantly decreased SCD protein levels and SCD activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, both isomers did not affect protein levels, but they inhibited SCD activity. These results suggest that in MDA-MB-231 cells the cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 CLA isomers regulate human SCD by reducing SCD protein levels, while in MCF-7 cells both isomers have a direct inhibitory effect on SCD enzyme activity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Choi, Youngjin","Park, Yeonhwa","Storkson, Jayne M","Pariza, Michael W","Ntambi, James M"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-291x(02)00554-5","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T16:00:49+00:00","issns":["0006-291X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1317356422,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12061775"],"pmid":"12061775","pubdate":"2002-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity by the cis-9,trans-11 isomer and the trans-10,cis-12 isomer of conjugated linoleic acid in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.","type":"article","volume":"294","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-stearoylcoa-desaturase-activity-cis9-trans11-isomer-trans10-cis12-isomer-conjugated-linol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4007720,"mean":5.0318148838285,"rank":919305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2532201,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4007720,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116606,"mean":6.9538436084811,"rank":32936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116606,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6986,"mean":2.2743124284078,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":2680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6986,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":1.675,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=453159570#altmetric_citation_8","license":"public","citation_ids":[4115991],"posted_on":"2011-09-30T04:20:22+00:00","summary":"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (delta-9-desaturase) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SCD gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=3246556","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Boghog","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Boghog"}}]}}
