Some patients have experienced frequent intradialytic hypotension (IDH). However, the characteristics of fluid shifts and which fluid space is affected remain controversial. Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the fluid spaces most affected by UF and to determine whether hydration status influences the fluid shifts during HD. This was a prospective cohort study of 40 patients undergoing HD. We measured the patient's fluid spaces using a whole-body bioimpedance apparatus to evaluate the changes in the fluid spaces before HD and 1-4\u2009hours of HD and 30\u2009minutes after HD. UF achieved during HD by the 40 patients (age, 60.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u2009years; 50% men; 50% of patients with diabetes; body weight, 61.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5\u2009kg) was 2.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.78\u2009L (measured fluid overload, 2.15\u2009\u00b1\u20091.24\u2009L). 1) Mean relative reduction of total body water and extracellular water was reduced from the start to the end of HD. 2) However, mean relative reduction of intracellular water was not reduced from the start to the end of HD. 3) No significant differences in fluid shifts were observed according to hydration status. The source of net UF during HD is mostly the extracellular space regardless of hydration status. Thus, IDH may be related to differences in the interstitial fluid shift to the vascular space.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029d9","authors":["Jeong, Hyeonju","Lim, Chae\u2010Wan","Choi, Hye\u2010Min","Oh, Dong\u2010Jin","Lim, Chae-Wan","Choi, Hye-Min","Oh, Dong-Jin"],"doi":"10.1111\/hdi.12323","endpage":"133","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T16:47:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1542-4758"],"issue":"1","journal":"Hemodialysis International","last_mentioned_on":1454208096,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hdi.12323\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hdi.12323\/abstract?campaign=woletoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hdi.12323\/pdf","pmid":"26046949","pubdate":"2015-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"129","subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"The source of net ultrafiltration during hemodialysis is mostly the extracellular space regardless of hydration status","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/source-net-ultrafiltration-during-hemodialysis-mostly-extracellular-space-regardless-hydration-statu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7066845,"mean":6.2846355963116,"rank":2801838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4161590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7066845,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215617,"mean":8.1205684272041,"rank":82811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":128502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215617,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226,"mean":1.7720177777778,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.69,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
