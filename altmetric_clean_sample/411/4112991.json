Fine and Gray proposed a proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with the assumption that the censoring distribution and the covariates are independent. Covariate-dependent censoring sometimes occurs in medical studies. In this paper, we study the proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with proper adjustments for covariate-dependent censoring. We consider a covariate-adjusted weight function by fitting the Cox model for the censoring distribution and using the predictive probability for each individual. Our simulation study shows that the covariate-adjusted weight estimator is basically unbiased when the censoring time depends on the covariates, and the covariate-adjusted weight approach works well for the variance estimator as well. We illustrate our methods with bone marrow transplant data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Here cancer relapse and death in complete remission are two competing risks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034ca","authors":["He, Peng","Eriksson, Frank","Scheike, Thomas H.","Zhang, Mei\u2010Jie"],"doi":"10.1111\/sjos.12167","endpage":"122","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T03:53:56+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1467-9469","0303-6898"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Statistics","last_mentioned_on":1433735607,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sjos.12167\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sjos.12167\/pdf","pmid":"27034534","pubdate":"2015-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Decision Sciences","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"startpage":"103","title":"A Proportional Hazards Regression Model for the Subdistribution with Covariates\u2010adjusted Censoring Weight for Competing Risks Data","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proportional-hazards-regression-model-subdistribution-covariatesadjusted-censoring-weight-competing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6374656,"mean":5.986409401293,"rank":4713349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":944795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6374656,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179712,"mean":8.7840033943387,"rank":125314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":34760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179712,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":2.6754736842105,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
