However the drawback of these direct acting antivirals (DAAs) is the emergence of resistance mutations. The prevalence of such mutations conferring resistance to HCV-NS5A inhibitors before treatment has not been investigated so far in the Tunisian population. The aim of this study was to detect HCV variants resistant to HCV-NS5A inhibitors in hepatitis C patients infected with HCV genotype 1 before any treatment with NS5A inhibitors.\nAmplification and direct sequencing of the HCV NS5A region was carried out on 112 samples from 149 untreated patients.\nIn genotype 1a strains, amino acid substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A inhibitors (M28V) were detected in 1\/7 (14.2\u00a0%) HCV NS5A sequences analyzed. In genotype 1b, resistance mutations in the NS5A region (R30Q; L31M; P58S and Y93H) were observed in 17\/105 (16.2\u00a0%) HCV NS5A sequences analyzed. R30Q and Y93H (n\u2009=\u20096; 5.7\u00a0%) predominated over P58S (n\u2009=\u20094; 3.8\u00a0%) and L31M (n\u2009=\u20093; 2.8\u00a0%).\nMutations conferring resistance to HCV NS5A inhibitors are frequent in treatment-na\u00efve Tunisian patients infected with HCV genotype 1b. Their influence in the context of DAA therapies has not been fully investigated and should be taken into consideration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Aissa Larousse, Jameleddine","Trimoulet, Pascale","Recordon Pinson, Patricia","Tauzin, Brigitte","Azzouz, Mohamed Mssadak","Ben Mami, Nabyl","Cheikh, Imed","Triki, Henda","Fleury, Herv\u00e9"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-015-0318-0","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T14:44:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1453548371,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26047611","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26047611?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26047611","pubdate":"2015-06-08T22:02:01+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) variants resistant to NS5A inhibitors in na\u00efve patients infected with HCV genotype 1 in Tunisia.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-hepatitis-c-virus-hcv-variants-resistant-ns5a-inhibitors-naive-patients-infected-hcv-geno"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7012411,"mean":6.2597681384832,"rank":3472822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2029641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7012411,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215293,"mean":8.1167975029264,"rank":115053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":78931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215293,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1504,"mean":3.3832029274784,"rank":903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":435,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1504,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":3.8275,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
