Monitoring CMV-specific T cell response could provide relevant information for patient care. We and others have shown the involvement of V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in controlling CMV infection. Here, we assessed if V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cell kinetics in peripheral blood predict CMV infection resolution and emergence of a mutant strain in high-risk recipients of kidney transplants, including 168 seronegative recipients receiving organs from seropositive donors (D+R-) and 104 seropositive recipients receiving antithymocyte globulins (R+\/ATG). V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cell percentages were serially determined in patients grafted between 2003 and 2011. The growing phase of V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was monitored in each infected patient, and the expansion rate during this phase was estimated individually by a linear mixed model. A V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion rate of \u02c30.06% per day predicted the growing phase. The time after infection at which an expansion rate of 0.06% per day occurred was correlated with the resolution of CMV DNAemia (r=0.91; P<0.001). At 49 days of antiviral treatment, V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion onset was associated with recovery, whereas absence of expansion was associated with recurrent disease and DNAemia. The appearance of antiviral-resistant mutant CMV strains was associated with delayed V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cell expansion (P<0.001). In conclusion, longitudinal surveillance of V\u03b42(neg) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in recipients of kidney transplants may predict CMV infection resolution and antiviral drug resistance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e9c","authors":["Hannah Kaminski","Isabelle Garrigue","Lionel Couzi","Benjamin Taton","Thomas Bachelet","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Moreau","Julie D\u00e9chanet-Merville","Rodolphe Thi\u00e9baut","Pierre Merville"],"doi":"10.1681\/asn.2014100985","first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T14:55:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-3450"],"journal":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology","last_mentioned_on":1433937302,"links":["http:\/\/jasn.asnjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/07\/ASN.2014100985.abstract","http:\/\/m.jasn.asnjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/07\/ASN.2014100985"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jasn.asnjournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/06\/07\/ASN.2014100985.full.pdf","pmid":"26054538","pubdate":"2015-06-10T22:06:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"Surveillance of \u03b3\u03b4 T Cells Predicts Cytomegalovirus Infection Resolution in Kidney Transplants.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surveillance-%CE%B3%CE%B4-t-cells-predicts-cytomegalovirus-infection-resolution-kidney-transplants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5214547,"mean":6.1508528861404,"rank":2763283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1772365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5214547,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176296,"mean":8.7083079951219,"rank":98808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":60124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176296,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2023,"mean":7.6181701285856,"rank":1234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2023,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":6.759525,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
