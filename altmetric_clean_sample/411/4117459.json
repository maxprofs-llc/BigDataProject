The aluminum-induced increase in blood-brain barrier permeability"],"citation":{"abstract":"The effect of aluminum on levels of inorganic phosphorus and acetylcholinesterase in blood and brain and on permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in different regions of the brain to the neuropeptide delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) was studied in adult rats. Aluminum (100 mg\/kg) significantly increased the permeability of the BBB to intracarotid 125I-N-Tyr-DSIP so that levels of radioactivity in whole brain were 45% higher than in control animals. The pattern of regional distribution of radioactivity in the brain was, however, unaffected, demonstrating that the affect of aluminum occurs throughout the BBB. Aluminum also significantly decreased inorganic phosphorus levels in the serum by 19%, but this effect did not correlate with BBB permeability to DSIP. Aluminum did not decrease brain levels of phosphorus despite the drop in blood levels of phosphorus nor affect brain or blood levels of acetylcholinesterase. Experiments with radioactive 32P reinforced the finding that blood but not brain levels of phosphorus are reliably affected by aluminum. The lack of correlation between changes in BBB permeability and decreased levels of inorganic phosphorus in the blood suggests that the effect of aluminum may not be mediated by its effects on phosphorus metabolism. Also, the change in BBB permeability after administration of aluminum does not appear to depend on changes in brain cholinergic activity but does occur throughout the brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033ea","authors":["Banks, W A","Kastin, A J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-08T19:36:55+00:00","issns":["0033-3158"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1501176841,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3927370","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3927370"],"pmid":"3927370","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"The aluminum-induced increase in blood-brain barrier permeability to delta-sleep-inducing peptide occurs throughout the brain and is independent of phosphorus and acetylcholinesterase levels.","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aluminuminduced-increase-bloodbrain-barrier-permeability-deltasleepinducing-peptide-occurs-throughou"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282957,"mean":6.9842712712639,"rank":1923435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6343638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282957,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222408,"mean":8.4725482291475,"rank":60999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":160822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222408,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3027,"mean":6.6537415730337,"rank":679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3027,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":5.9142641509434,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Other":1,"Professor":4},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"DE":1},"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DoomsdaysCW\/status\/607994507934765056","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4117459],"posted_on":"2015-06-08T19:36:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Doomsday's CW","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/802295526263635968\/Hi-vs-Rh_normal.jpg","description":"Activist, FmrJourno, Historian, Earthling #NoH8 #NoNukes #NoDAPL #IdleNoMore #HumanRights #GetMoneyOut #LGBTQ #SandersGabbard2020 \nAganst #Oligarchy #Corruption","id_on_source":"DoomsdaysCW","tweeter_id":"2218836026","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3559},"tweet_id":"607994507934765056"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/uketukeman\/status\/608105779074199553","license":"datasift","rt":["DoomsdaysCW"],"citation_ids":[4117459],"posted_on":"2015-06-09T02:58:10+00:00","author":{"name":"\u91d1\u7530 \u82b3\u548c","url":"http:\/\/ameblo.jp\/akiva\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/431715271577841665\/TARanmFc_normal.jpeg","description":"#NoToRacism\u203c#PMAbe\u203c #HiroakiKoide\uff06@utsunomiyakenji\uff06@yamamototaro0\uff06@noiehoie\uff06@Snowden\uff06@wikileaks.
