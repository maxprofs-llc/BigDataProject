A series of kinetic experiments were carried out to study the influence of various factors, including the pH, oxidant doses, temperature, and presence of typical anions (Cl(-), SO4(2-), NO3(-)), humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (FA) on triclosan removal. The optimal reaction conditions were: pH\u00a0=\u00a08.0, [TCS]0:[KMnO4]0\u00a0=\u00a01:2.5, and T\u00a0=\u00a025\u00a0\u00b0C, where 20\u00a0mg\/L of TCS could be completely degraded in 120\u00a0s. However, the rate of TCS (20\u00a0\u03bcg\/L) oxidation by KMnO4 ([TCS]0:[KMnO4]0\u00a0=\u00a01:2.5) was 1.64\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-3)\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)\u00b7h(-1), lower than that at an initial concentration of 20\u00a0mg\/L (2.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(3)\u00a0mg\u00a0L(-1)\u00b7h(-1)). A total of eleven products were detected by liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) analysis, including phenol and its derivatives, benzoquinone, an organic acid, and aldehyde. Two main reaction pathways involving CO bond cleavage (-C(8)O(7)-) and benzene ring opening (in the less chlorinated benzene ring) were proposed, and were further confirmed based on frontier electron density calculations and point charges. Furthermore, the changes in the toxicity of the reaction solution during TCS oxidation by KMnO4 were evaluated by using both the luminescent bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and the water flea Daphnia magna. The toxicity of 20 mg\/L triclosan to D.\u00a0magna and P.\u00a0phosphoreum after 60\u00a0min\u00a0was reduced by 95.2% and 43.0%, respectively. Phenol and 1,4-benzoquinone, the two representative degradation products formed during permanganate oxidation, would yield low concentrations of DBPs (STHMFP, 20.99-278.97\u00a0\u03bcg\/mg; SHAAFP, 7.86\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)-45.77\u00a0\u03bcg\/mg) after chlorination and chloramination. Overall, KMnO4 can be used as an effective oxidizing agent for TCS removal in water and wastewater treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003717","authors":["Jing Chen","Ruijuan Qu","Xiaoxue Pan","Zunyao Wang","Chen, Jing","Qu, Ruijuan","Pan, Xiaoxue","Wang, Zunyao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.watres.2016.07.041","endpage":"223","first_seen_on":"2016-07-26T03:51:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00431354","1879-2448"],"journal":"Water Research","last_mentioned_on":1469702733,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S004313541630553X&_version=1&md5=33fe28eddb0c675ea0d3669de2406aa1","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27459151?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27459151","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"215","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Oxidative degradation of triclosan by potassium permanganate: Kinetics, degradation products, reaction mechanism, and toxicity evaluation","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxidative-degradation-triclosan-potassium-permanganate-kinetics-degradation-products-reaction-mechan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148366,"mean":6.8920487793494,"rank":4324044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2256177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148366,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257833,"mean":11.988849785907,"rank":141508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257833,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3048,"mean":3.2856442402363,"rank":1789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3048,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167,"mean":2.1340120481928,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
