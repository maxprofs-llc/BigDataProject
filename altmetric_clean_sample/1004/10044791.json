These polymers can be easily collected and rapidly separated using an external magnetic field, and also exhibit a high specific recognition for ofloxacin enantiomers. The preparation of amino-functionalized MMIPs was carried out via suspension polymerization and a ring-opening reaction using rac-ofloxacin as a template, ethylenediamine as an active group, glycidyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate as functional monomers, divinylbenzene as a cross-linker, and Fe\u2083O\u2084 nanoparticles as magnetic cores. The characteristics of the MMIPs were assessed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements. Furthermore, the adsorption properties were determined using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The conditions for use of these MMIPs as magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) sorbents, including pH, adsorption time, desorption time, and eluent, were investigated in detail. An extraction method using MMIPs coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed for the determination of ofloxacin enantiomers in fish samples. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) for the developed method were 0.059 and 0.067 \u03bcg\u2219mL(-1) for levofloxacin and dextrofloxacin, respectively. The recovery of ofloxacin enantiomers ranged from 79.2% \u00b1 5.6% to 84.4% \u00b1 4.6% and ofloxacin enantiomers had good linear relationships within the concentration range of 0.25-5.0 \u03bcg\u2219mL(-1) (R\u00b2 > 0.999). The obtained results demonstrate that MSPE-HPLC is a promising approach for preconcentration, purification, and simultaneous separation of ofloxacin enantiomers in biomatrix samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Yan-Fei Wang"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules21070915","first_seen_on":"2016-07-26T06:03:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"7","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1469512974,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/7\/915"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1420-3049\/21\/7\/915\/pdf","pmid":"27428943","pubdate":"2016-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"915","subjects":["biology"],"title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Magnetic Molecularly Imprinted Polymer for the Enrichment of Ofloxacin Enantiomers in Fish Samples","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-characterization-magnetic-molecularly-imprinted-polymer-enrichment-ofloxacin-enantiomers-f"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":7043919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257634,"mean":11.974161392368,"rank":217835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257634,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3796,"mean":2.1617712779974,"rank":2577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3796,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":5.48625,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
