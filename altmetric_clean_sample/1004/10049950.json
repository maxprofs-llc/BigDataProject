However, efficient collagen SHG scoring in histological slides is hampered by the limited depth-of-field of usual nonlinear microscopes relying on focused Gaussian beam excitation. In this work we analyze theoretically and experimentally the use of Bessel beam excitation to address this issue. Focused Bessel beams can provide an axially extended excitation volume for nonlinear microscopy while preserving lateral resolution. We show that shaping the focal volume has consequences on signal level and scattering directionality in the case of coherent signals (such as SHG) which significantly differ from the case of incoherent signals (two-photon excited fluorescence, 2PEF). We demonstrate extended-depth SHG-2PEF imaging of fibrotic mouse kidney histological slides. Finally, we show that Bessel beam excitation combined with spatial filtering of the harmonic light in wave vector space can be used to probe collagen accumulation more efficiently than the usual Gaussian excitation scheme. These results open the way to SHG-based histological diagnoses.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Nelly Vuillemin","Pierre Mahou","Delphine D\u00e9barre","Thierry Gacoin","Pierre-Louis Tharaux","Marie-Claire Schanne-Klein","Willy Supatto","Emmanuel Beaurepaire"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep29863","first_seen_on":"2016-07-26T09:59:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1469527149,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep29863"],"pmcid":"PMC4951755","pmid":"27435390","pubdate":"2016-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological techniques","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Nonlinear optics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Multiphoton microscopy","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biophotonics","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"29863","subjects":["science"],"title":"Efficient second-harmonic imaging of collagen in histological slides using Bessel beam excitation","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-secondharmonic-imaging-collagen-histological-slides-using-bessel-beam-excitation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133552,"mean":6.8851399141579,"rank":6181958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1089699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133552,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257634,"mean":11.974131698967,"rank":182503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257634,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33640,"mean":14.882613632986,"rank":24532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":5251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33640,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3250,"mean":16.27301446599,"rank":2341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3250,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
