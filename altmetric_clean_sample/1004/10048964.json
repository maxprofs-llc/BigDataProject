Behavioral interventions and physical activity prescriptions were similar for both groups. Primary outcomes were changes in body weight and adverse event frequency; secondary outcomes included measures of physical function and body composition.\nILCD average weight change was -19.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2 kg or 15.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6% of initial body weight compared with -9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7 kg or 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9% for BDD. ILCD lost more fat mass (-7.7 kg, 95% CI [-11.9 to -3.5]) but had similar loss of lean mass (-1.7 kg, 95% CI [-4.1 to 0.6]) compared with BDD. There were no significant differences in change in physical function or adverse event frequency.\nCompared with a traditional BDD intervention, older adults who have severe obesity treated with intensive medical weight loss had greater weight loss and decreases in fat mass without a higher frequency of adverse events. In the short term, however, this did not translate into greater improvements in physical function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000834f","authors":["D.
