Novel animal model systems and imaging approaches are needed to understand the mechanisms of disease initiation, and to develop novel therapies for BPH. Long-term administration of both estradiol (E) and testosterone (T) in mice can result in prostatic enlargement and recapitulate several clinical components of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Here we use longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analyses to quantify changes in prostatic volume, urethral volume, and genitourinary vascularization over time in response to estradiol-induced prostatic enlargement. Our data demonstrate significant prostatic enlargement by 12 weeks post-treatment, with no detectable immune infiltrate by macrophages, T- or B-cell populations. Importantly, the percentage of cell death as measured by TUNEL was significantly decreased in the prostatic epithelium of treated animals as compared to controls. We found no significant change in prostate cell proliferation in treated mice when compared to controls. These studies highlight the utility of MRI to quantify changes in prostatic and urethral volumes over time. In conjunction with histological analyses, this approach has the high potential to enable mechanistic studies of initiation and progression of clinically relevant LUTS. Additionally, this model is tractable for investigation and testing of therapeutic interventions to ameliorate or potentially reverse prostatic enlargement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006988","authors":["Erin M.
