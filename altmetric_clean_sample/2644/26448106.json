In this paper we propose a new discriminant analysis framework for coal-rock recognition. In the framework, a data acquisition model with vibration and acoustic signals is designed and the caving dataset with 10 feature variables and three classes is got. And the perfect combination of feature variables can be automatically decided by using the multi-class F-score (MF-Score) feature selection. In terms of nonlinear mapping in real-world optimization problem, an effective minimum enclosing ball (MEB) algorithm plus Support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for rapid detection of coal-rock in the caving process. In particular, we illustrate how to construct MEB-SVM classifier in coal-rock recognition which exhibit inherently complex distribution data. The proposed method is examined on UCI data sets and the caving dataset, and compared with some new excellent SVM classifiers. We conduct experiments with accuracy and Friedman test for comparison of more classifiers over multiple on the UCI data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good robustness and generalization ability. The results of experiments on the caving dataset show the better performance which leads to a promising feature selection and multi-class recognition in coal-rock recognition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["QingJun Song","HaiYan Jiang","Qinghui Song","XieGuang Zhao","Xiaoxuan Wu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0184834","first_seen_on":"2017-09-22T18:10:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1506103794,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0184834"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0184834&type=printable","pmid":"28937987","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0184834","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Combination of minimum enclosing balls classifier with SVM in coal-rock recognition","type":"article","volume":"12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451303,"mean":7.1041024516615,"rank":7302278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451303,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117179,"mean":11.815478144362,"rank":95679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117179,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116423,"mean":10.67735395372,"rank":98097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116423,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1664,"mean":12.891690920024,"rank":1324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1664,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/911291478873460737","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26448106],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T18:09:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1277},"tweet_id":"911291478873460737"}]}}
