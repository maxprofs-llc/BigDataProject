A sample of 997 exclusively heterosexual adults participated in an on-line study set in Croatia, a country with high homophobia undergoing social change which threatens the higher status of the heterosexual majority. Beliefs about immutability and universality of homosexuality were associated with less intentions to discriminate, and more readiness to engage in positive behavior, while discreteness beliefs were inversely related to both. Furthermore, attitudes towards LGs seem to be the mechanism behind the observed links. Results suggest essentialist beliefs might be fuel for attitudes, which are in turn associated with behavioral intentions. Importantly, essentialist beliefs had both indirect (with attitudes as mediators), and direct effects on behavioral intentions speaking in favor of their robust role in explaining LG related phenomena.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013cc","authors":["Aleksandra Huic","Margareta Jelic","Zeljka Kamenov"],"doi":"10.1080\/00918369.2017.1383104","first_seen_on":"2017-09-22T13:40:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0091-8369","1540-3602"],"journal":"Journal of Homosexuality","last_mentioned_on":1506087640,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28934073?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28934073","pubdate":"2017-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences"],"title":"Essentialist Beliefs About Homosexuality Predict Positive and Negative Behavioral Intentions Toward Lesbian Women and Gay Men","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":2,"1m":2,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":3676460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4653349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117177,"mean":11.815402454428,"rank":44805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":70247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117177,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":774,"mean":5.9373298835705,"rank":457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":774,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":8.8178571428571,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lesbianandgay\/statuses\/911223701420380160","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26440060],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T13:40:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Mark","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1FsF","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2446802433\/untitled_normal.jpg","description":"Gay and Lesbian issues and publications","id_on_source":"lesbianandgay","tweeter_id":"725022439","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1047},"tweet_id":"911223701420380160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/LesbianayGay\/statuses\/911223726619815938","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26440060],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T13:40:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Ana","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2442499566\/untitled_normal.jpg","description":"Gay y Lesbiana bestsellers","id_on_source":"LesbianayGay","tweeter_id":"722689682","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":796},"tweet_id":"911223726619815938"}]}}
