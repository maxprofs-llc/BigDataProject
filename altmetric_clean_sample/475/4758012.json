Methods pLenti-H1 FHL1 shRNA was cloned, and then transfered into HEK293T cells. The inhibitory effect of pLenti-H1 FHL1 shRNA on FHL1 gene was detected by Western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Lentivirus particles were packaged, added to HeLa and HepG2 cells, followed by puromycin treatment for 2-3 weeks to screen stable clones. The knockdown effect on FHL1 expression in these cells was checked by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. Cell growth and colony formation analysis were performed to investigate the effect of FHL1 down-regulation on tumor cell growth. Soft agar analysis was used to analyze its effect on anchorage-independent tumor cell growth. Results Western blotting and qRT-PCR revealed that the pLenti-H1 FHL1 shRNA apparently inhibited the expression of FHL1 gene. Cell growth and colony formation assay showed that the lentiviral-mediated shRNA for FHL1 gene significantly accelerated the tumor cell growth in HepG2 and HeLa cells. Soft agar analysis demonstrated that FHL1 shRNA increased the anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells. Conclusion pLenti-H1 FHL1 shRNA could significantly accelerate tumor cell growth via inhibiting the expression of FHL1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd0f","authors":["Fan, Zhongyi","Xu, Xiaojie","Zhang, Xiaomei","Wang, Tao","Han, Baiyu","Liang, Yingchun","Ye, Qinong","Jiao, Shunchang"],"first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T12:22:20+00:00","issns":["1007-8738"],"issue":"7","journal":"Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology","last_mentioned_on":1447419575,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26146054?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26146054","pubdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"[FHL1 knockdown mediated by lentiviral shRNA promotes the growth of HeLa and HepG2 cells].","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fhl1-knockdown-mediated-lentiviral-shrna-promotes-growth-hela-hepg2-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":2539318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3946982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208418,"mean":10.141417312407,"rank":85291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":120146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208418,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":0.81975609756098,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.59375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MuscleStemCell\/statuses\/665142582201024513","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4758012],"posted_on":"2015-11-13T12:22:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Satellite Cell Bot","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507221205141577729\/FQlptquo_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting articles on muscle stem cells from pubmed RSS feeds.","id_on_source":"MuscleStemCell","tweeter_id":"2788297100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":225},"tweet_id":"665142582201024513"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Vectalys\/statuses\/665152023613054976","license":"gnip","rt":["MuscleStemCell"],"citation_ids":[4758012],"posted_on":"2015-11-13T12:59:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Vectalys","url":"http:\/\/www.vectalys.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/722395000072507392\/ZaQOYY1V_normal.jpg","description":"Vectalys is a #biotechnology company which provides #genetransfer products and services based on highly purified and concentrated #lentiviral vectors.","id_on_source":"Vectalys","tweeter_id":"2653764446","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":203},"tweet_id":"665152023613054976"}]}}
