Wnt signaling pathways have an important function in controlling the fate of MSCs. However, the mechanism through which Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling is regulated in differentiation of MSCs remains unknown. SIRT1 plays an important role in the regulation of MSCs differentiation.\nThis study aimed to determine the effect of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) on adipogenesis and myogenic differentiation of C3H10T1\/2 cells. First, the MSC commitment and differentiation model was established by using 5-azacytidine. Using the established model, C3H10T1\/2 cells were treated with SIRT1 activator\/inhibitor during differentiation. The results showed that resveratrol inhibits adipogenic differentiation and improves myogenic differentiation, whereas nicotinamide promotes adipogenic differentiation. Notably, during commitment, resveratrol blocked adipocyte formation and promoted myotubes differentiation, whereas nicotinamide enhanced adipogenic potential of C3H10T1\/2 cells. Furthermore, resveratrol elevated the expression of Cyclin D1 and \u03b2-catenin in the early stages. The luciferase assay showed that knockdown SIRT1 inhibits Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling, while resveratrol treatment or overexpression SIRT1 activates Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signaling. SIRT1 suppressed the expression of Wnt signaling antagonists sFRP2 and DACT1. Knockdown SIRT1 promoted adipogenic potential of C3H10T1\/2 cells, whereas overexpression SIRT1 inhibited adipogenic differentiation and promoted myogenic differentiation.\nTogether, our results suggested that SIRT1 inhibits adipogenesis and stimulates myogenic differentiation by activating Wnt signaling.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007f1","authors":["Yuanfei Zhou","Yuanfei Zhou","Zheng Zhou","Wei Zhang","Xiaoming Hu","Hongkui Wei","Jian Peng","Siwen Jiang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13578-015-0055-5","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T14:37:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-3701"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cell & Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1447425436,"links":["http:\/\/cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13578-015-0055-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13578-015-0055-5?hostname=http:\/\/cellandbioscience.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"26568817","pubdate":"2015-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"startpage":"1","title":"SIRT1 inhibits adipogenesis and promotes myogenic differentiation in C3H10T1\/2 pluripotent cells by regulating Wnt signaling","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sirt1-inhibits-adipogenesis-promotes-myogenic-differentiation-c3h10t12-pluripotent-cells-regulating"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":4855606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":964856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208417,"mean":10.141468131046,"rank":143027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208417,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":2.048397515528,"rank":107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.1958333333333,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
