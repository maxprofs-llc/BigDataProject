Chromosomal analysis, performed over a 20-year period, on 1,001 Down syndrome subjects, revealed pure trisomy 21 karyotype in 880 subjects (87.92%), mosaic trisomy karyotype in 77 (7.69%), and translocation karyotype in 44 (4.39%). The mean maternal age was found to be 30.34 years, and mean paternal age was 31.04 years. Nondisjunctional error was 79.24% maternal and 20.76% paternal. The findings of the study revealed the significant contribution of advanced parental age and increased maternal meiotic nondisjunctional error to the origin of trisomy 21 Down syndrome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Jyothy, A","Kumar, K S","Mallikarjuna, G N","Babu Rao, V","Uma Devi, B","Sujatha, M","Reddy, P P"],"doi":"10.1007\/s100380170071","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T17:49:15+00:00","issns":["1434-5161"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1447430400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11393539"],"pmid":"11393539","pubdate":"2001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Legacy","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Parental age and the origin of extra chromosome 21 in Down syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parental-age-origin-extra-chromosome-21-down-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":400446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":6163828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208418,"mean":10.141395960982,"rank":21716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":186687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208418,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":753,"mean":5.6988111702128,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":753,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":6.6955263157895,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
