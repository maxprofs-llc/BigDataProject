This highly invasive cancer is very difficult to detect until its later stages, resulting in limited treatment options and low survival rates. There is a dearth of knowledge regarding the mechanisms associated with the effects of biomechanical forces such as interstitial fluid flow (IFF) on hepatocellular carcinoma invasion. We hypothesized that interstitial fluid flow enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion through chemokine-mediated autologous chemotaxis. Utilizing a 3D in vitro invasion assay, we demonstrated that interstitial fluid flow promoted invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell lines. Furthermore, we showed that autologous chemotaxis influences this interstitial fluid flow-induced invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma derived cell lines via the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)\/C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) signaling axis. We also demonstrated that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling affects interstitial fluid flow-induced invasion; however, this pathway was separate from CXCR4\/CXCL12 signaling. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential role of interstitial fluid flow in hepatocellular carcinoma invasion. Uncovering the mechanisms that control hepatocellular carcinoma invasion will aid in enhancing current liver cancer therapies and provide better treatment options for patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Shah, Arpit D","Bouchard, Michael J","Shieh, Adrian C"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0142337","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T12:01:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1447416095,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26560447?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26560447","pubdate":"2015-11-13T22:03:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Interstitial Fluid Flow Increases Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Invasion through CXCR4\/CXCL12 and MEK\/ERK Signaling.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interstitial-fluid-flow-increases-hepatocellular-carcinoma-cell-invasion-through-cxcr4cxcl12-mekerk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":5599852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208417,"mean":10.141468370951,"rank":166027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208417,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99814,"mean":9.8164172803143,"rank":83870,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5190,"mean":9.7759529774523,"rank":4248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5190,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
