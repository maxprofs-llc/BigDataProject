The adaptation of pancreatic cancer cells to limited oxygen delivery promotes the induction of an invasive and treatment-resistant phenotype, triggering metastases at an early stage of tumor development, which resist in most cases adjuvant therapies following tumor resection. In this article, the authors summarize the evidence demonstrating the significance of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and discuss the possible hypoxia induced mechanisms underlying its aggressive nature. We then conclude with promising strategies that target hypoxia-adapted pancreatic cancer cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Erkan, Mert","Kurtoglu, Metin","Kleeff, Jorg"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2016.1117386","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T15:51:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1747-4132"],"journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1449101319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26560854?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/17474124.2016.1117386?ai=1lbbq&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"26560854","pubdate":"2015-11-13T22:02:42+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"The role of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer: a potential therapeutic target?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-hypoxia-pancreatic-cancer-potential-therapeutic-target-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6644977,"mean":6.1548448788946,"rank":4916367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":974968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6644977,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235020,"mean":9.3032448014841,"rank":159508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235020,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":1.524135,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.4104166666667,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
