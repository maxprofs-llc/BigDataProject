Meta-analysis was undertaken for pooled estimates where appropriate.\nEleven studies (946 neonates) were included (nine randomised controlled trials and two prospective cohort studies). Six trials reported consistently measured ototoxicity outcomes in neonates treated with gentamicin and the pooled estimate for hearing loss was 3% (95%CI 0-7%). Nephrotoxicity could not be assessed due to variation in case definitions used. Estimates of the number of neonates potentially affected by gentamicin toxicity were not undertaken due to insufficient data.\nGiven wider scale-up of outpatient-based and lower-level treatment of PSBI, improved data are essential to better assess the risks from neonatal gentamicin treatment without assessment of blood levels, in order to maximise benefit and reduce harm.
