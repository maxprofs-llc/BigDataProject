Both outcome and balancing measures were compared for the 6 months before and after this change in process. To evaluate the relationship between throughput times and patient satisfaction, we also analyzed data collected during a 32-month period.\nThe median DTP decreased from 44 min in the pre period to 25 min in the post period (Cohen's r value = 0.29; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The percent DTP < 30 min also significantly improved (pre: 31.8%, post: 58.2%, odds ratio = 2.99; 95% confidence interval 2.87-3.12; p < 0.001). For the benchmark satisfaction question of \"likelihood to recommend,\" there was also an improvement in the mean responses (pre: 89.0, post: 92.7, Cohen's r value = 0.10; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). There were no significant differences in the balancing measures of nurse practitioner productivity and compliance with two nurse-initiated protocols. There was a weak inverse correlation between throughput times and satisfaction scores (Spearman's rank correlation -0.18; p\u00a0< 0.001).\nAlthough immediate bedding improved the front-end efficiency in our ED, it cannot yet be considered as a \"best practice\" in pediatric emergency medicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Flood, Robert","Szwargulski, Paula","Qureshi, Nadeem","Bixby, Mary","Laffey, Steven","Pratt, Ryan","Gerard, James"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2015.10.008","first_seen_on":"2015-11-12T16:29:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["07364679","0736-4679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1448833803,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0736467915010562&_version=1&md5=4b851c8c397b2751d8383ed56586c8a8","http:\/\/www.jem-journal.com\/article\/S0736-4679(15)01056-2\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26577525?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26577525","pubdate":"2015-11-19T22:01:17+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Immediate Bedding and Patient Satisfaction in a Pediatric Emergency Department.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immediate-bedding-patient-satisfaction-pediatric-emergency-department"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6619724,"mean":6.1397779725815,"rank":4897688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":971614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6619724,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209915,"mean":10.191413188258,"rank":144264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":42390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209915,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1466,"mean":6.3676068259386,"rank":1165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1466,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":4.2976363636364,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
