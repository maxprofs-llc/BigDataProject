P3HB\/TEB systems constructed as films and pellets have been studied using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray structure analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. TEB release from the experimental formulations has been studied in aqueous and soil laboratory systems. In the soil with known composition of microbial community, polymer was degraded, and TEB release after 35\u00a0days reached 60 and 36\u00a0% from films and pellets, respectively. That was 1.23 and 1.8 times more than the amount released to the water after 60\u00a0days in a sterile aqueous system. Incubation of P3HB\/TEB films and pellets in the soil stimulated development of P3HB-degrading microorganisms of the genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Variovorax, and Streptomyces. Experiments with phytopathogenic fungi F. moniliforme and F. solani showed that the experimental P3HB\/TEB formulations had antifungal activity comparable with that of free TEB.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Volova, Tatiana","Zhila, Natalia","Vinogradova, Olga","Shumilova, Anna","Prudnikova, Svetlana","Shishatskaya, Ekaterina"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-015-5739-1","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T11:28:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1447426632,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26561327?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26561327","pubdate":"2015-11-13T22:02:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Characterization of biodegradable poly-3-hydroxybutyrate films and pellets loaded with the fungicide tebuconazole.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-biodegradable-poly3hydroxybutyrate-films-pellets-loaded-fungicide-tebuconazole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6564711,"mean":6.0829954575298,"rank":2917616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3470941,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6564711,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208417,"mean":10.141457095425,"rank":102198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":97517,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208417,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1580,"mean":2.2271513616213,"rank":348,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1580,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":0.96670909090909,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":92,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/665128997810888704","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4757669],"posted_on":"2015-11-13T11:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":321},"tweet_id":"665128997810888704"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/pseudo_papers\/statuses\/665181623025971200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4757669],"posted_on":"2015-11-13T14:57:12+00:00","author":{"name":"pseudomonaspapers","url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=pseudomonas","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/570219565901029376\/j3RfXxUz_normal.jpeg","description":"PubMed search bot for pseudomonas.
