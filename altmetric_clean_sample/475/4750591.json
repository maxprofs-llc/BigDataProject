The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education International (ACGME-I) began accrediting institutions in 2009. This study aimed to describe ACGME-I-accredited institutions and explore perceptions of their leaders and clinician educators (CEs) regarding preparedness, challenges, and initial impact of accreditation.\nCross-sectional surveys of all ACGME-I-accredited institutions' leaders and CEs were conducted from June 2013 to June 2014. Eligible participants were identified through institution Web sites and GME offices. Combinations of Web- and paper-based surveys were employed.\nCompleted surveys were received from 24 (70.6%) of 34 institutional leaders and 274 (76.3%) of 359 CEs, representing 3 countries, 8 academic medical centers, 2 affiliated teaching hospitals, and 47 residency programs. Leaders and CEs felt prepared in the domains of knowledge and implementation of the competencies. Top challenges were excessive \"demands on faculty time\" and \"bureaucratic procedures.\" The majority of both groups perceived a positive impact of accreditation on all learner, faculty, institution, and patient outcomes; most perceived no impact on patient satisfaction. Overall, 79.2% of leaders and 75.8% of CEs agreed or strongly agreed that seeking ACGME-I accreditation was worthwhile.\nThis study indicates that despite the challenges identified, initial perceptions of the impact of ACGME-I accreditation are positive. Findings from this study may be useful to institutions and countries considering similar GME reform, though long-term outcome data are needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056af","authors":["Archuleta, Sophia","Ibrahim, Halah","Stadler, Dora J","Shah, Nina G","Chew, Nicholas W","Cofrancesco, Joseph"],"doi":"10.1097\/acm.0000000000000906","first_seen_on":"2015-11-11T23:04:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-808X","1040-2446"],"issue":"11 Suppl","journal":"Academic medicine","last_mentioned_on":1447297754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26505107","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/academicmedicine\/Fulltext\/2015\/11001\/Perceptions_of_Leaders_and_Clinician_Educators_on.15.aspx"],"pmid":"26505107","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Perceptions of Leaders and Clinician Educators on the Impact of International Accreditation","type":"article","volume":"90","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perceptions-leaders-clinician-educators-impact-international-accreditation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6562576,"mean":6.081396308004,"rank":2314315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4211163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6562576,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209382,"mean":10.175798510849,"rank":75641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":131985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209382,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2464,"mean":9.1183987007714,"rank":1551,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":888,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2464,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":11.0652,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hopkins_IEE\/statuses\/664557543709110274","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4750591],"posted_on":"2015-11-11T21:37:19+00:00","author":{"name":"IEE","url":"http:\/\/www.hopkinsmedicine.org\/institute_excellence_education\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/601417539294367744\/fFxo1QLA_normal.jpg","description":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institute for Excellence in Education.
