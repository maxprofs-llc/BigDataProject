Pancreas-wide mutant mice were generated to compare the postnatal significance of MafB (MafB(\u0394panc)) and MafA\/B (MafAB(\u0394panc)) to deficiencies associated with the related, \u03b2-cell-enriched MafA mutant (MafA(\u0394panc)). Insulin(+) cell production and \u03b2-cell activity was merely delayed in MafB(\u0394panc) islets until MafA was comprehensively expressed in this cell population. We propose that MafA compensates for the absence of MafB in MafB(\u0394panc) mice, which is supported by the death of MafAB(\u0394panc) mice soon after birth from hyperglycemia. However, glucose-induced glucagon secretion was compromised in adult MafB(\u0394panc) islet \u03b1-cells. Based upon these results, we conclude that MafB is only essential to islet \u03b1-cell activity, and not \u03b2-cell. Interestingly, a notable difference between mice and humans is that MAFB is coexpressed with MAFA in adult human islet \u03b2-cells. Here we show that non-human primate (NHP) islet \u03b1- and \u03b2-cells also produce MAFB, implying that MAFB represents a unique signature and likely important regulator of the primate islet \u03b2-cell.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220e","authors":["Conrad, Elizabeth","Dai, Chunhua","Spaeth, Jason","Guo, Min","Cyphert, Holly A","Scoville, David","Carroll, Julie","Yu, Wei-Ming","Goodrich, Lisa V","Harlan, David M","Grove, Kevin L","Roberts, Charles T","Powers, Alvin C","Gu, Guoqiang","Stein, Roland"],"doi":"10.1152\/ajpendo.00285.2015","first_seen_on":"2015-11-12T13:15:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1555"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1447686631,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26554594"],"pmid":"26554594","pubdate":"2015-11-12T22:01:18+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","physiology","endocrinology"],"title":"The MAFB transcription factor impacts islet \u03b1-cell function in rodents and represents a unique signature of primate islet \u03b2-cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mafb-transcription-factor-impacts-islet-%CE%B1cell-function-rodents-represents-unique-signature-primate-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6574363,"mean":6.0951058539218,"rank":2690391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3855969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6574363,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209426,"mean":10.18596810314,"rank":92438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":115594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209426,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1244,"mean":7.9099163314562,"rank":642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1244,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":32.522692307692,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
