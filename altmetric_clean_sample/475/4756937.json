ITK and BTK regulate mast cell responses to allergens, but their roles in mast cell responses in LPS-induced sepsis are unclear.\nWe sought to investigate the roles of ITK and BTK in mast cell responses during LPS-induced septic inflammation.\nMice (genetically modified or bone marrow-derived mast cell-reconstituted Sash) were given LPS to induce septic hypothermia in the presence or absence of indicated inhibitors. Flow cytometry was used to determine LPS-induced cell influx and TNF-\u03b1 production in peritoneal cells. Microarray was used for genomewide gene expression analysis on bone marrow-derived mast cells. Quantitative PCR and multiplex were used to determine transcribed and secreted proinflammatory cytokines. Microscopy and Western blotting were used to determine activation of signal transduction pathways.\nThe absence of ITK and BTK leads to exacerbation of\u00a0LPS-induced septic hypothermia and neutrophil influx. Itk(-\/-)Btk(-\/-)\u00a0mast cells exhibit hyperactive preformed and LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 production, and lead to more severe LPS-induced septic hypothermia when reconstituted into mast cell-deficient Sash mice. LPS-induced nuclear factor kappa B, Akt, and p38 activation is enhanced in Itk(-\/-)Btk(-\/-) mast cells, and blockage of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, Akt, or p38 downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting serine\/threonine kinase 1 activation significantly suppresses TNF-\u03b1 hyperproduction and attenuates septic hypothermia.\nITK and BTK regulate thermal homeostasis during septic response through mast cell function in mice. They share regulatory function downstream of Toll-like receptor 4\/LPS in mast cells, through regulating the activation of canonical nuclear factor kappa B, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase\/Akt, and p38 signaling pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["Huang, Weishan","Morales, J Luis","Gazivoda, Victor P","August, Avery","Weishan Huang","J.
