The strategic engineering of chemical and topographic properties has also led to the design of \u03b2-peptide mimics of higher-order oligomers. More recently, the ability of these peptides to self-assemble into complex structures of controlled geometries has been exploited in materials applications. The focus of this mini-review is on how the unique structural features of \u03b2-peptide assemblies have been exploited in the design of self-assembled proteomimetic bundles and nanomaterials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","authors":["Gopalan, Romila D","Del Borgo, Mark P","Mechler, Adam I","Perlmutter, Patrick","Aguilar, Marie-Isabel","Romila\u00a0D.
