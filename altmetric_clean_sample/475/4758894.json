This meta-analysis assessed the associations between IL-6 gene polymorphisms and OSA susceptibility, IL-6 levels in OSA, and CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and T&A (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy) therapy for IL-6 in OSA.\nStudies regarding IL-6 polymorphisms, serum IL-6 levels, and OSA treatment were identified using PubMed and Embase. The associations between IL-6 gene polymorphisms and OSA risk (estimated by pooling odds ratios (ORs) with 95\u00a0% confidence intervals (CIs)) were assessed using an allele model. The pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95\u00a0% CI of IL-6 were estimated using a random-effects model. Meta-regression, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias were also evaluated.\nIn total, 53 studies were included. In adults, a significant association between -174 G\/C and OSA susceptibility was observed (OR\u2009=\u20091.46, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20091.14-1.87) and IL-6 levels were higher in OSA compared to controls (SMD\u2009=\u20091.56, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20091.18-1.95); however, no association was observed for the -572 G\/C allele (OR\u2009=\u20091.13, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.87-1.47) and OSA susceptibility and there was no significant change in IL-6 in pre- and post-CPAP therapy (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.24, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.73 to 0.26). In children, IL-6 levels were also higher in OSA (SMD\u2009=\u20091.27, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.29-2.26) and T&A treatment significantly decreased them (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.97, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u2009-1.72 to -0.22).\nThis meta-analysis indicates that the IL-6 gene polymorphism -174 G\/C, and not -572 G\/C, is associated with adult OSA risk. Although IL-6 levels increased in OSA, CPAP did not significantly suppress them in adults with OSA. In children with OSA, IL-6 levels also increased and T&A therapy significantly decreased them.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f61000894b","authors":["Anyuan Zhong","Xiaolu Xiong","Minhua Shi","Huajun Xu"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11325-015-1288-6","first_seen_on":"2015-11-13T16:10:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1522-1709","1520-9512"],"journal":"Sleep and Breathing","last_mentioned_on":1490875352,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11325-015-1288-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26564171?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26564171?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11325-015-1288-6.pdf","pmid":"26564171","pubdate":"2015-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pneumology\/Respiratory System","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Roles of interleukin (IL)-6 gene polymorphisms, serum IL-6 levels, and treatment in obstructive sleep apnea: a meta-analysis.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s11325-015-1288-6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-interleukin-il6-gene-polymorphisms-serum-il6-levels-treatment-obstructive-sleep-apnea-metaanal-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8435952,"mean":7.094002543155,"rank":6098121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2035180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8435952,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245221,"mean":9.6705396378761,"rank":151749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":77723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245221,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":2.6225931972789,"rank":273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.5051724137931,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Master":6},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/665200077636440064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4758894],"posted_on":"2015-11-13T16:10:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":982},"tweet_id":"665200077636440064"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/665548553452781569","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4758894],"posted_on":"2015-11-14T15:15:15+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":387},"tweet_id":"665548553452781569"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SleepResearch_\/statuses\/847418764089974787","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4758894],"posted_on":"2017-03-30T12:02:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Sleep Research","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sleep-Research\/105093012946768?ref=hl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2694954403\/9f320ff3ac0d13ed3582e204a8c1c768_normal.jpeg","description":"Highlights and news from the latest research on sleep","id_on_source":"SleepResearch_","tweeter_id":"868205960","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1623},"tweet_id":"847418764089974787"}]}}
