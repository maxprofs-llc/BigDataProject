Since the first outbreak of PDCoV in the United States in 2014, this novel porcine coronavirus has been detected in South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and China. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-2014, was isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea on a pig farm in Henan Province, China, and examined with a specific immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that CHN-HN-2014 shares 91.6%-99.4% nucleotide identity with other known PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of CHN-HN-2014 was further investigated in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets. Both kinds of piglets developed clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and severe diarrhea, by 2days postinoculation (DPI), and diarrhea persisted for about 5-6 days. Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in challenged 5-day-old pigs and until 18 DPI in challenged 21-day-old pigs. At necropsy at 4 DPI, macroscopic and microscopic lesions were observed and viral antigen was detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining. These data demonstrate that Chinese PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 shares high nucleotide identity with previously reported PDCoV strains and is pathogenic in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fb","authors":["Nan Dong","Liurong Fang","Hao Yang","Han Liu","Ting Du","Puxian Fang","Dang Wang","Huanchun Chen","Shaobo Xiao"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vetmic.2016.10.022","endpage":"106","first_seen_on":"2016-11-29T07:01:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03781135","1873-2542"],"journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1480406262,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0378113516305168"],"pmid":"27939164","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"98","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Isolation, genomic characterization, and pathogenicity of a Chinese porcine deltacoronavirus strain CHN-HN-2014","type":"article","volume":"196","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/isolation-genomic-characterization-pathogenicity-chinese-porcine-deltacoronavirus-strain-chnhn2014"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":4095503,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2179209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250499,"mean":12.182897771639,"rank":137527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250499,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1347,"mean":2.1627711738484,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1347,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":2.0393650793651,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
