Here, the stability of organic compounds on synthetic Mn oxides was analyzed using inlet electrochemical mass spectroscopy. Carboxyl groups, which are the most abundant residues around the Mn4 cluster, were found to stably facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Toru Hayashi","Akira Yamaguchi","Kazuhito Hashimoto","Ryuhei Nakamura"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cc07092b","endpage":"13763","first_seen_on":"2016-11-29T09:01:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-548X","1359-7345"],"issue":"95","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1489561064,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cc\/c6cc07092b#!divAbstract?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1039\/C6CC07092B","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/C6CC07092B"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cc\/c6cc07092b","pmid":"27805189","pubdate":"2016-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"13760","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Stability of organic compounds on the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II and manganese oxide water oxidation catalysts","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?DOI=C6CC07092B","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stability-organic-compounds-oxygenevolving-center-photosystem-ii-manganese-oxide-water-oxidation-cat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.6,"score_history":{"1y":10.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":810864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7547275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":280118,"mean":11.923013205196,"rank":40561,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":239429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":280118,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5978,"mean":3.0385624895432,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":5723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5978,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":3.8393205741627,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
