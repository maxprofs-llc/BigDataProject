Close family members were not allowed to provide medical follow-up, treatment, protection regarding his vulnerability, and preserve the dignity of their loved one. The issue was the court's prioritization of the autonomy of the individual over his mental health status. The purpose of this case study was to identify the pitfalls of a court case seeking medical follow-up and treatment for a family member with schizophrenia and anosognosia. The method was qualitative and the design was descriptive and instrumental, linking the law to the life experience resulting from the procedures for its implementation. This study examined the difference between clinical and medical-legal evaluation of the examinee. The application of the Therapeutic Jurisprudence principles to the high number of schizophrenia cases with anosognosia, the abandonment of the mentally ill, and family crisis call healthcare providers and the Judiciary for an improvement action of the process of guardianship.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b68","authors":["Kozlowski-Gibson, Maria","Maria Kozlowski-Gibson"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijlp.2016.08.005","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T10:08:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6386","01602527"],"journal":"International Journal of Law & Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1473847667,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27622655?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0160252716301844&_version=1&md5=61d4ea5e6ebca1689ecb533ef3ed613a"],"pmid":"27622655","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry","jurisprudence"],"title":"The struggle for schizophrenia treatment: A case study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/struggle-schizophrenia-treatment-case-study-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":6360136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1135806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251853,"mean":12.452842264504,"rank":177377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":42823,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251853,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":558,"mean":3.9304775583483,"rank":405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":558,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.45,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
