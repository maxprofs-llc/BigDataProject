Performance of 4-month-old infants tested with a forced-choice novelty-preference technique was consistent with predictions based on Wallach's ratio rule. This result suggests that the ability to extract and maintain information about local luminance ratios is present early in infancy. This ability is likely to contribute to the development of lightness constancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Sarina Hui-Lin Chien","John Palmer","Davida Y.
