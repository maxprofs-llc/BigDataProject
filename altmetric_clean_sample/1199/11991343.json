This study sought to determine the possibility of being able to distinguish between healthy and failing pregnancies by utilising patient-associated risk factors and daily urinary hCG levels.\nData were from a study that collected daily early morning urine samples from women trying to conceive (n=1,505); 250 of whom became pregnant. Data from 129 women who became pregnant (including 44 miscarriages) were included in these analyses. A longitudinal model was used to profile hCG, a Cox proportional hazards model to assess demographic\/menstrual history data on the time to failed pregnancy, and a two-stage model to combine these two models.\nThe profile for log hCG levels in women suffering miscarriage differs to that of viable pregnancies; rate of hCG rise is slower in those suffering a biochemical loss (loss of a pregnancy only diagnosed by a positive hCG serum\/urine test) and tends to plateau at a lower log hCG in women suffering an early miscarriage, compared with viable pregnancies. Maternal age, longest cycle length and time from luteinising hormone (LH) surge to hCG reaching 25 mIU\/mL were found to be significantly associated with miscarriage risk. The two-stage model found that for an increase of 1 day in the time from LH surge to hCG reaching 25 mIU\/mL, there is a 30% increase in miscarriage risk (hazard ratio: 1.30; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.62).\nRise of hCG in early pregnancy could be useful to predict pregnancy viability. Daily tracking of urinary hCG may enable early identification of some pregnancies at risk of miscarriage.
