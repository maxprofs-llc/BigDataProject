In normal cells, however, SPOP is located in the nucleus and induces apoptosis. Here we show that a structure-based design and subsequent hit optimization yield small molecules that can inhibit the SPOP-substrate protein interaction and can suppress oncogenic SPOP-signaling pathways. These inhibitors kill human ccRCC cells that are dependent on oncogenic cytoplasmic SPOP. Notably, these inhibitors minimally affect the viability of other cells in which SPOP is not accumulated in the cytoplasm. Our findings validate the SPOP-substrate protein interaction as an attractive target specific to ccRCC that may yield novel drug discovery efforts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002496","authors":["Guo, Zhong-Qiang","Zheng, Tong","Chen, Baoen","Luo, Cheng","Ouyang, Sisheng","Gong, Shouzhe","Li, Jiafei","Mao, Liu-Liang","Lian, Fulin","Yang, Yong","Huang, Yue","Li, Li","Lu, Jing","Zhang, Bidong","Zhou, Luming","Ding, Hong","Gao, Zhiwei","Zhou, Liqun","Li, Guoqiang","Zhou, Ran","Chen, Ke","Liu, Jingqiu","Wen, Yi","Gong, Likun","Ke, Yuwen","Yang, Shang-Dong","Qiu, Xiao-Bo","Zhang, Naixia","Ren, Jin","Zhong, Dafang","Yang, Cai-Guang","Liu, Jiang","Jiang, Hualiang","Zhong-Qiang Guo","Tong Zheng","Baoen Chen","Cheng Luo","Sisheng Ouyang","Shouzhe Gong","Jiafei Li","Liu-Liang Mao","Fulin Lian","Yong Yang","Yue Huang","Li Li","Jing Lu","Bidong Zhang","Luming Zhou","Hong Ding","Zhiwei Gao","Liqun Zhou","Guoqiang Li","Ran Zhou","Ke Chen","Jingqiu Liu","Yi Wen","Likun Gong","Yuwen Ke","Shang-Dong Yang","Xiao-Bo Qiu","Naixia Zhang","Jin Ren","Dafang Zhong","Cai-Guang Yang","Jiang Liu","Hualiang Jiang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ccell.2016.08.003","endpage":"484","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T10:21:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-3686","15356108"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cancer Cell","last_mentioned_on":1474132800,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27622336?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/fulltext\/S1535-6108(16)30386-5&rc=0&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.cell.com\/cancer-cell\/fulltext\/S1535-6108(16)30386-5"],"pmid":"27622336","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"474","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Small-Molecule Targeting of E3 Ligase Adaptor SPOP in Kidney Cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1535610816303865","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/smallmolecule-targeting-e3-ligase-adaptor-spop-kidney-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.904,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.904},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":467967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7924208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251994,"mean":12.452315183358,"rank":23743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":228251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251994,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1545,"mean":17.226006476684,"rank":308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1545,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":32.852577777778,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
