We examined the expression of chemokines, cytokines, and leukocyte markers on the mRNA levels and histopathologic changes in human skin biopsies of tick bites (n=37) compared to unaffected skin (n=9). Early tick bite skin lesions (<24 h of tick attachment) were characterized by a predominance of macrophages and dendritic cells, elevated mRNA levels of macrophage chemoattractants (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) and neutrophil chemoattractants (CXCL1, CXCL8), of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1\u03b2 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-5. In contrast, the numbers of lymphocytes and mRNA levels of lymphocyte cell markers (CD4, CD8, CD19), lymphocyte chemoattractants (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL13, CCL1, CCL22), dendritic cell chemoattractants (CCL20), and of other pro- (IL-6, IL-12p40, IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF\u03b2) did not differ from normal skin. With longer tick attachment (>24 h), the numbers of innate immune cells and mediators (not significantly) declined, whereas the numbers of lymphocytes (not significantly) increased. Natural tick bites by Ixodes ricinus ticks initially elicit a strong local innate immune response in human skin. Beyond 24h of tick attachment, this response usually becomes less, perhaps because of immunomodulation by tick saliva. This article is protected by copyright.
