Regulations governing the management of antibiotics in the nursing facility will likely be changing in the near future, which will put the pharmacist at the forefront of a clinical team that is dedicated to proper antibiotic utilization. Savvy pharmacists are embracing this opportunity to engage long-term care facility staff to improve the care of their residents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006fcf","authors":["Martin, Caren McHenry"],"doi":"10.4140\/tcp.n.2016.358","endpage":"364","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T10:16:55+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0888-5109","08885109"],"issue":"7","journal":"Consultant Pharmacist","last_mentioned_on":1473848200,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27412311?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27412311","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"358","subjects":["pharmacy"],"title":"Antibiotic Stewardship in Long-Term Care: A Call to Action","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibiotic-stewardship-longterm-care-call-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251854,"mean":12.452782893195,"rank":209026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251854,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":3.1472511848341,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
