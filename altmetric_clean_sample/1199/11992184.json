Previous studies report deficiency in virus-induction of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, -\u03b2 and -\u03bb in bronchial epithelial and bronchial lavage cells in atopic asthmatics. It is now recognized that asthma is a heterogeneous disease comprising different inflammatory phenotypes, some of which may involve innate immune activation in the absence of overt infection.\nThe aim of the study was investigate if the severity of asthma or a specific cellular sputum pattern may be linked to evidence of innate immune activation.\nHere we investigate the expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2\/3 (IL-28A\/B) and the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and viperin in unstimulated sputum cells in 57 asthmatics (including 16 mild, 19 moderate and 22 severe asthma patients) and compared them with 19 healthy subjects.\nWe observed increased expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1\/IL-29, OAS and viperin in asthmatic compared to healthy subjects while IL-28 was not expressed in any group. The overexpression was restricted to neutrophilic asthmatics (sputum neutrophils \u2265 76%) while eosinophilic asthmatics (sputum eosinophils \u2265 3%) did not differ from healthy subjects or even showed a lower expression of Mx1. No difference in interferon or ISG expression was seen according to clinical asthma severity.\nNeutrophilic, but not eosinophilic, asthmatics display overexpression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1\/IL-29 and ISGs in their sputum cells that may reflect ongoing innate immune activation.
