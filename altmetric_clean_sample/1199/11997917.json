The samples were stored in refrigeration condition for 15days and were analyzed for total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae count, lactic acid bacteria count, Pseudomonas spp. count, psychrotrophic count, and yeast and mold count, as well as fate of inoculated Listeria monocytogenes at 3-day intervals. Results indicated that values of tested microbial indicators in all samples increased during storage. Antimicrobial agents, when used in combination, had stronger effect in preserving the microbial quality of chicken meat samples rather than their individual use and the strongest effect was observed in samples coated with alginate solution containing both cinnamon and rosemary EOs (CEO+REO). However, all treatments significantly inhibited microbial growth when compared to the control (P<0.05). Therefore, based on the results of this study, application of alginate coating solutions containing nisin, cinnamon, and rosemary EOs as natural preservatives is recommended in meat products especially in chicken meats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Raeisi, Mojtaba","Tabaraei, Alijan","Hashemi, Mohammad","Behnampour, Nasser"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.08.042","endpage":"145","first_seen_on":"2016-09-14T13:50:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3460","01681605"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1477154242,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27620825?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27620825","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"139","subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effect of sodium alginate coating incorporated with nisin, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and rosemary essential oils on microbial quality of chicken meat and fate of Listeria monocytogenes during refrigeration","type":"article","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-sodium-alginate-coating-incorporated-nisin-cinnamomum-zeylanicum-rosemary-essential-oils-micr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7578098,"mean":6.5350293264878,"rank":3697091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3688479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7578098,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242547,"mean":12.171834926158,"rank":122928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":110333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242547,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1417,"mean":2.7860268361582,"rank":716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":663,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1417,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.5869387755102,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
