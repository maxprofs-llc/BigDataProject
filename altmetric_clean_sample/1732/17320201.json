Health promotion is a core function of comprehensive primary health care; however, little has been published on what enables or challenges health promotion practice in an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service. Apunipima Cape York Health Council (Apunipima) delivers primary health care to 11 remote north Queensland communities. The workforce includes medical, allied health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers and health practitioners and corporate support staff. This study aimed to identify current health promotion practices at Apunipima, and the enablers and challenges identified by the workforce, which support or hinder health promotion practice. Sixty-three staff from across this workforce completed an online survey in February 2015 (42% response rate). Key findings were: (1) health promotion is delivered across a continuum of one-on-one approaches through to population advocacy and policy change efforts; (2) the attitude towards health promotion was very positive; and (3) health promotion capacity can be enhanced at both individual and organisational levels. Workforce insights have identified areas for continued support and areas that, now identified, can be targeted to strengthen the health promotion capacity of Apunipima.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f610003984","authors":["Kathryn McFarlane","Sue Devine","Jenni Judd","Nina Nichols","Kerrianne Watt"],"doi":"10.1071\/py16033","first_seen_on":"2017-03-13T23:46:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1448-7527","1836-7399"],"journal":"Australian Journal of Primary Health","last_mentioned_on":1505186433,"links":["http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/py\/PY16033","http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/PY\/PY16033","http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/py\/PY16033#sthash.lHDzrcJG.uxfs"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/py\/pdf\/PY16033","pmid":"28162218","pubdate":"2017-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"CSIRO PUBLISHING","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Workforce insights on how health promotion is practised in an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.publish.csiro.au\/?paper=PY16033","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/workforce-insights-health-promotion-practised-aboriginal-community-controlled-health-service"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.9,"score_history":{"1y":7.9,"6m":4.2,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":1142478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7259476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243668,"mean":13.684937049333,"rank":50506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":193013,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243668,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":3.8468055555556,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.9583333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":7}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Franklin_R_C\/statuses\/841435340606918656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[17320201],"posted_on":"2017-03-13T23:46:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Richard C Franklin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1772391587\/Richard_Franklin_Head_Shot_small_normal.jpg","description":"Associate Professor @ James Cook University and Senior Research Fellow @ Royal Life Saving Society Australia.
