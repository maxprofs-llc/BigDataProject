The phenomenology of these patterns, and of the shapes of their constituent domains, is reviewed here from a point of view that interprets these patterns as a manifestation of modulated phases. These phases are stabilized by competing interactions and are characterized by periodic spatial variations of the pertinent order parameter, the corresponding modulation period generally displaying a dependence on temperature and other external fields. This simple picture provides a unifying framework to account for striking and substantial similarities revealed in the prevalent \"stripe\" and \"bubble\" morphologies as well as in commonly observed, characteristic domain-shape instabilities. Several areas of particular current interest are discussed.","ads_id":"1995Sci...267..476S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Michael Seul","David Andelman"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.267.5197.476","first_seen_on":"2017-03-14T05:19:57+00:00","issns":["0036-8075","1095-9203"],"issue":"5197","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1489459380,"links":["https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1126\/science.267.5197.476"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/sci\/267\/5197\/476.full.pdf","pmid":"17788780","pubdate":"1995-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Domain Shapes and Patterns: The Phenomenology of Modulated Phases","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.267.5197.476","volume":"267","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/domain-shapes-patterns-phenomenology-modulated-phases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.336,"score_history":{"1y":8.336,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.336},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":1067799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7286803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242966,"mean":13.633244738954,"rank":48050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":194909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242966,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41676,"mean":33.438600263947,"rank":16801,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":24863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41676,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1067,"mean":79.381142589118,"rank":505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1067,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":17,"Researcher":44,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
