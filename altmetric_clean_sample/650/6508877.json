We investigated the association of n-3 PUFAs levels with carotid atherosclerosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), who are at high risk for cardiovascular events.\nCarotid ultra-sound was performed in a total of 461 patients on HD (male 67%, age 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012years, diabetes rate 46%). Intima-media thickness (IMT) and the plaque score (PS) in carotid arteries were measured. Carotid atherosclerosis was defined as IMT >1.2\u00a0mm and\/or PS\u00a0>\u00a05.0. The levels of n-6 PUFAs [dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)] and n-3 PUFAs [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] were also measured prior to carotid ultra-sound.\nCarotid atherosclerosis was observed in 94 patients (20.4%). Individual PUFAs levels were comparable between patients with and without carotid atherosclerosis. However, the ratio of EPA\/AA and that of n-3\/n-6 PUFAs were significantly lower in patients with carotid atherosclerosis compared to those without (median 0.36 vs. 0.41, p\u00a0=\u00a00.031 and 0.85 vs. 0.93, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041, respectively]. After adjustment for other confounders, the ratio of EPA\/AA (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.70, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0055) and the ratio of n-3\/n-6 PUFAs (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.80, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0066) showed an independent reverse association with carotid atherosclerosis. In addition, the area under receiver-operating characteristic curves for carotid atherosclerosis was significantly greater in an established risk model with EPA\/AA and n-3\/n-6 ratios than in the established risk model alone.\nThese data suggest that low ratios of both EPA\/AA ratio and n-3\/n-6 PUFAs were closely associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients on HD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002346","authors":["Norio Umemoto","Hideki Ishii","Daisuke Kamoi","Toru Aoyama","Takashi Sakakibara","Hiroshi Takahashi","Akihito Tanaka","Yoshinari Yasuda","Susumu Suzuki","Tatsuaki Matsubara","Toyoaki Murohara","Umemoto, Norio","Ishii, Hideki","Kamoi, Daisuke","Aoyama, Toru","Sakakibara, Takashi","Takahashi, Hiroshi","Tanaka, Akihito","Yasuda, Yoshinari","Suzuki, Susumu","Matsubara, Tatsuaki","Murohara, Toyoaki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.atherosclerosis.2016.03.037","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T00:11:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1484","00219150"],"journal":"Atherosclerosis (00219150)","last_mentioned_on":1502069729,"links":["http:\/\/www.atherosclerosis-journal.com\/article\/S0021-9150(16)30111-3\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27065243","http:\/\/www.atherosclerosis-journal.com\/article\/S0021-9150%2816%2930111-3\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021915016301113"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.atherosclerosis-journal.com\/article\/S0021915016301113\/pdf","pmid":"27065243","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Reverse association of omega-3\/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratios with carotid atherosclerosis in patients on hemodialysis","type":"article","volume":"249","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reverse-association-omega3omega6-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-ratios-carotid-atherosclerosis-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":1.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":3373930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4936946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":277111,"mean":11.459197019234,"rank":99863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":175694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":277111,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1893,"mean":5.8059270613108,"rank":825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1893,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":7.0014545454545,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"FI":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Reverse association of omega-3\/omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratios with carotid...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1692851700995682&id=1447381608876027","license":"public","citation_ids":[6508877],"posted_on":"2016-04-06T05:33:55+00:00","summary":"Korkeampi omega3\/6-suhde yhdistyi v\u00e4hemp\u00e4\u00e4n valtimonkovettumatautiin (kaulavaltimosta mitattuna)\n\nSyy vai seuraus?\n\nItse muistelisin, ett\u00e4 omega3-rasvahapot ovat erityisen herkki\u00e4 hapettumiselle.
