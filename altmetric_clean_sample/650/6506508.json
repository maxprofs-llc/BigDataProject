The objective of this study was to observe possible changes in lung structure and explain their relationship with gas exchange abnormalities.\nCross-sectional analytical study with a control group, conducted at a university hospital.\nThe study included 36 patients with acromegaly and 24 controls who were all assessed through high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax (CT). Arterial blood gas, effort oximetry and serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) were also assessed in the patients with acromegaly.\nThe abnormalities found in the CT scan were not statistically different between the acromegaly and control groups: mild cylindrical bronchiectasis (P = 0.59), linear opacity (P = 0.29), nodular opacity (P = 0.28), increased attenuation (frosted glass; P = 0.48) and decreased attenuation (emphysema; P = 0.32). Radiographic abnormalities were not associated with serum GH and IGF-1. Hypoxemia was present in seven patients; however, in six of them, the hypoxemia could be explained by underlying clinical conditions other than acromegaly: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in two, obesity in two, bronchial infection in one and asthma in one.\nNo changes in lung structure were detected through thorax tomography in comparison with the control subjects. The functional respiratory alterations found were largely explained by alternative diagnoses or had subclinical manifestations, without any plausible relationship with lung structural factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6a13cf058f610009a14","authors":["Rodrigues, Marcelo Palmeira","Naves, Luciana Ansaneli","Viegas, Carlos Alberto","Melo-Silva, Cesar Augusto","Paula, Wagner Diniz de","Cabral, M\u00e1rcia Teixeira","Ara\u00fajo, Renata Rodrigues","Casulari, Luiz Augusto"],"doi":"10.1590\/1516-3180.2013.7640012","endpage":"400","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T21:25:51+00:00","issns":["1806-9460"],"issue":"5","journal":"Sao Paulo Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1459977933,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26648427?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26648427","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"394","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Prevalence of lung structure abnormalities in patients with acromegaly and their relationship with gas exchange: cross-sectional analytical study with a control group","type":"article","volume":"133","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-lung-structure-abnormalities-patients-acromegaly-relationship-gas-exchange-crosssectional"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":6502297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271021,"mean":11.223849140285,"rank":229038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271021,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":1.5550724637681,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/717825596298891264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6506508],"posted_on":"2016-04-06T21:25:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":409},"tweet_id":"717825596298891264"}]}}
