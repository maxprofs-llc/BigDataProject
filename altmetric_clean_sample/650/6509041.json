DSPD is characterized by sleep onset that occurs significantly later than desired bedtimes and societal norms. Individuals with DSPD exhibit long sleep latencies when attempting to sleep at conventional bedtimes. Circadian sleep disorders such as DSPD can occur when there is misalignment between sleep timing and societal norms. This review discusses studies using light therapy to advance the timing of sleep in adolescents and college students, in particular on those suffering from DSPD. A discussion on how to increase effectiveness of light therapy in the field will also be provided.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90e3cf058f61000cc0c","authors":["Mariana Figueiro","Mariana G Figueiro"],"doi":"10.2147\/nss.s85849","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T00:28:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-1608"],"journal":"Nature and science of sleep","last_mentioned_on":1481499036,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/delayed-sleep-phase-disorder-clinical-perspective-with-a-focus-on-ligh-peer-reviewed-article-NSS","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4830627\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4830627"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=29761","pmid":"27110143","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Delayed sleep phase disorder: clinical perspective with a focus on light therapy","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delayed-sleep-phase-disorder-clinical-perspective-focus-light-therapy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7876706,"mean":6.669712343671,"rank":726451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7143392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7876706,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":273990,"mean":11.284286653843,"rank":38204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":235301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":273990,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":6.0603243243243,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":94,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.3644444444444,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":13}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
