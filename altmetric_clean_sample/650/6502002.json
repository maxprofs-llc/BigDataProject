A total of 384 male broiler chickens were used to determine the influence of GPR (without addition or added at 0.04% of diet) and two levels of apparent metabolisable energy (AMEN) (according to standard requirements (Diets SE) or energy reduced by 0.4\u00a0MJ\/kg diet (Diets LE)) on birds' performance and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD). ATTD of ether extract (EE) and AMEN were measured on d 14 and 35, and ATTD of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was measured on d 35. All diets were based on wheat-maize-soybean meal with rapeseed oil and lard (blend of 50:50) as fat sources. During the grower period and the whole trial, birds fed Diets supplemented with GPR were characterised by higher body weight gain (BWG) and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to chicken receiving diets without GPR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). At the end of experiment, birds fed Diet LE without GPR were characterised by lower BWG and higher FCR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Supplementation with GPR caused a higher ATTD of EE for diets SE and LE at d 14 and 35 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the GPR addition to Diet LE improved ATTD of NDF at d 35 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, the findings suggest that GPR effects the digestion of a blend of animal fat\/rapeseed oil positively, even in a practical maize-wheat-based broiler diet with decreased AMEN level.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f6100011ba","authors":["Kaczmarek, Sebastian Andrzej","Bochenek, Maciej","Samuelsson, Anne-Cathrine","Rutkowski, Andrzej"],"doi":"10.1080\/1745039x.2015.1061722","endpage":"296","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T18:24:13+00:00","issns":["1477-2817","1745-039X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Archives of Animal Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1459960654,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26147512?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26147512","pubdate":"2015-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"285","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effects of glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate on nutrient utilisation and performance of broiler chickens","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-glyceryl-polyethylene-glycol-ricinoleate-nutrient-utilisation-performance-broiler-chickens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7506617,"mean":6.4985319251666,"rank":6502283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7506617,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271021,"mean":11.223910390377,"rank":229040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271021,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":2.0367469879518,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
