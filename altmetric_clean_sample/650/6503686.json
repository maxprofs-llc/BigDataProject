It was reported that 5-hmC levels were decreased in a variety of cancers and could be regarded as an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. In the present study, 5-hmC levels were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 173 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and 91 corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues; DNA dot blot assays were used to detect the 5-hmC level in another 50 pairs of ESCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues. In addition, the mRNA level of TET1, TET2 and TET3 in these 50 pairs of ESCC tissues was detected by real-time PCR. The IHC and DNA dot blot results showed that 5-hmC levels were significantly lower in ESCC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues (P = 0.029). TET2 and TET3 expression was also significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues (TET2, P < 0.0001; TET3, P = 0.009), and the decrease in 5-hmC was significantly associated with the downregulation of TET2 expression (r = 0.405, P = 0.004). Moreover, the loss of 5-hmC in ESCC tissues was significantly associated with poor overall survival among patients with ESCC (P = 0.043); multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the loss of 5-hmC in ESCC tissues was an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator for patients with ESCC (HR = 1.569, P = 0.029). In conclusion, 5-hmC levels were decreased in ESCC tissues, and the loss of 5-hmC in tumor tissues was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with ESCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Xuejiao Shi","Yue Yu","Mei Luo","Zhirong Zhang","Susheng Shi","Xiaoli Feng","Zhaoli Chen","Jie He","Shi, Xuejiao","Yu, Yue","Luo, Mei","Zhang, Zhirong","Shi, Susheng","Feng, Xiaoli","Chen, Zhaoli","He, Jie"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0153100","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T19:27:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1460043278,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0153100","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050164","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27050164?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0153100.PDF","pmid":"27050164","pubdate":"2016-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0153100","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Loss of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Is an Independent Unfavorable Prognostic Factor for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-5hydroxymethylcytosine-independent-unfavorable-prognostic-factor-esophageal-squamous-cell-carci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":3879005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2102664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271161,"mean":11.224529075084,"rank":147471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271161,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107295,"mean":10.191188640558,"rank":61909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":34261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107295,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5376,"mean":13.094485953488,"rank":3435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5376,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
