Strength\/power measures included back extensor muscle strength, standing long jump (SLJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), and 3-hop jump tests. Associations between balance with strength\/power variables were calculated according to peak-height-velocity (PHV).\nThere were significant medium-large sized correlations between all balance measures with back extensor strength (r=.486-.791) and large associations with power (r=.511-.827). These correlation coefficients were significantly different between pre-PHV and circa PHV as well as pre-PHV and post-PHV with larger associations in the more mature groups. Irrespective of maturity-status, SLJ was the best strength\/power predictor with the highest proportion of variance (12-47%) for balance (i.e., Stork eyes opened) and the YBT was the best balance predictor with the highest proportion of variance (43-78%) for all strength\/power variables.\nThe associations between balance and muscle strength\/power measures in youth athletes that increase with maturity may imply transfer effects from balance to strength\/power training and vice versa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d78","authors":["Hammami, Raouf","Chaouachi, Anis","Makhlouf, Issam","Granacher, Urs","Behm, David G"],"doi":"10.1123\/pes.2015-0231","first_seen_on":"2016-04-06T20:23:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1543-2920","0899-8493"],"journal":"Pediatric Exercise Science","last_mentioned_on":1463324121,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27046937","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27046937?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"27046937","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine","pediatrics"],"title":"Associations Between Balance and Muscle Strength, Power Performance in Male Youth Athletes of Different Maturity Status","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/associations-between-balance-muscle-strength-power-performance-male-youth-athletes-different-maturit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7980686,"mean":6.7340350122768,"rank":567660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7412741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7980686,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275189,"mean":11.292109968458,"rank":29908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":245243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275189,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":6.2525689655172,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.9166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":16,"researcher":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":14,"Scientists":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
