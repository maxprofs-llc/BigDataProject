Keytapping times and key-operating characteristics of a female subject typing on the Qwerty and Dvorak keyboards for six weeks each were collected and analyzed. The results showed that characteristics of the typed material and the movements of hands and fingers were significantly related to keytapping times. The most significant factors affecting keytapping times were association frequency between letters, consecutive use of the same hand or finger, and the finger used. A regression equation for relating keytapping times to ergonomic principles was fitted to the data. Finally, a protocol for design of computerized keyboard layout based on the regression equation was proposed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032c0","authors":["Shieh, K K","Lin, C C"],"doi":"10.2466\/pms.1999.88.1.113","endpage":"125","first_seen_on":"2016-04-07T01:06:41+00:00","issns":["0031-5125","1558-688X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Perceptual & Motor Skills","last_mentioned_on":1459991181,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/10214637\/?i=3&from=\/740482\/related"],"pmid":"10214637","pubdate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"113","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"A QUANTITATIVE MODEL FOR DESIGNING KEYBOARD LAYOUT","type":"article","volume":"88","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-model-designing-keyboard-layout"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7516464,"mean":6.5017388130518,"rank":3878928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2102643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7516464,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270838,"mean":11.237317272012,"rank":147269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270838,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1151,"mean":5.4115913043478,"rank":740,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":219,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1151,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":32.33975,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
