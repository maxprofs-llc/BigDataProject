In this study, we characterized \u03b2-lactam-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from six wastewater samples obtained from two pharmaceutical industries located in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. Bacteria were isolated by using MacConkey agar; species identification and antibacterial susceptibility testing were performed by Vitek 2. Etest was used for ESBL phenotype confirmation. The presence of \u03b2-lactamase genes was investigated by PCR and sequencing. Bacterial strain typing was done by XbaI-macrorestriction and subsequent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as well as multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Thirty-five bacterial species were isolated from the six samples; among them, we identified seven K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to \u03b2-lactams and co-resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and folate pathway inhibitors. The ESBL phenotype was confirmed in six K. pneumoniae isolates that harbored ESBL genes blaCTX-M-15 (n\u2009=\u20095), blaSHV-2 (n\u2009=\u20091), and blaSHV-12 (n\u2009=\u20091). PFGE and MLST analysis revealed five clones belonging to four sequence types (ST11, ST15, ST37, ST101), and clone K. pneumoniae-ST101 was present in the wastewater samples from two different pharmaceutical industries. Additionally performed conjugation assays confirmed the location of \u03b2-lactamase genes on conjugative plasmids. This is the first confirmation of K. pneumoniae isolates producing CTX-M-15-ESBL from pharmaceutical wastewaters in Nigeria. The co-resistance observed might be a reflection of the different drugs produced by these industries. Continuous surveillance of the environmental reservoirs of multidrug-resistant bacteria is necessary to prevent their further spread.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c2","authors":["Obasi, Avemaria","Nwachukwu, SimonCyril","Ugoji, Esther","Kohler, Christian","G\u00f6hler, Andr\u00e9","Balau, Veronica","Pfeifer, Yvonne","Steinmetz, Ivo"],"doi":"10.1089\/mdr.2016.0269","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T10:11:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1076-6294","1931-8448"],"journal":"Microbial Drug Resistance: Mechanism, Epidemiology, & Disease","last_mentioned_on":1491391652,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28375698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28375698","pubdate":"2017-04-05T22:02:27+00:00","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from Pharmaceutical Wastewaters in South-Western Nigeria","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6116458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2041295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251370,"mean":13.074879615227,"rank":164730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251370,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":412,"mean":2.0462919708029,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":412,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.97608695652174,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AntibioticResis\/statuses\/849564573506035712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18507094],"posted_on":"2017-04-05T10:09:13+00:00","author":{"name":"AntibioticResistance","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/551766191962746880\/GlO2QteM_normal.jpeg","description":"Keep abreast of the latest developments in the fight against Antibiotic Resistance #AMR with the latest publications curated from PubMed.
