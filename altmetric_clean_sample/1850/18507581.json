To date, human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) has been intensively studied but its diagnostic is controversial in EC. DJ-1 is an oncoprotein secreted by cancer cells, recently identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker for breast cancer, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performances of DJ-1 and HE4 measured in EC patients and healthy controls (HC).\nForty-five patients (63.9\u00b112.0\u00a0years) with EC and 29 (63.2\u00b113.3\u00a0years) HC were enrolled. Serum concentrations of DJ-1 and HE4 were measured using ELISA kits developed by R&D (Minneapolis, USA) and Fujirebio Diagnostic (Malvern, PA, USA), respectively. Differences between EC patients and HC were assessed by Mann-Whitney test and associations were tested by Spearman's correlation. The diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves analysis.\nSerum DJ-1 concentrations were found to be higher in EC patients than in HC (9533.6 vs 1988.5\u00a0pg\/mL; P<.0001). The area under the ROC curve (ROC-AUC) was 0.95 (P<.0001). At the cut-off of 3654\u00a0pg\/mL, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 and 0.90, respectively. HE4 serum levels were higher in EC patients than in HC (75.3 vs 56.2\u00a0pmol\/L; P=.019), with an AUC of 0.66 (P=.020). The AUC obtained by the combination of the two markers resulted 0.96 (P<.0001).\nThese results suggest that increased serum DJ-1 levels are associated with EC and that this biomarker may be potentially useful for diagnosing EC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a16","authors":["Benati, Marco","Montagnana, Martina","Danese, Elisa","Paviati, Elisa","Giudici, Silvia","Ruzzenente, Orazio","Franchi, Massimo","Lippi, Giuseppe"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcla.22223","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T10:28:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-2825"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Laboratory Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1491388087,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28374920?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28374920","pubdate":"2017-04-05T22:04:25+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"The clinical significance of DJ-1 and HE4 in patients with endometrial cancer.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251370,"mean":13.074886776014,"rank":207849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251370,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239,"mean":2.0205714285714,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":5.828,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/849569330048008192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18507581],"posted_on":"2017-04-05T10:28:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"849569330048008192"}]}}
