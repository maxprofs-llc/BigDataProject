However, its ability to predict response to chemotherapy is uncertain.\nPatients treated for primary breast cancer at the University Hospital of Cologne were identified. Immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 detection was performed according to standard protocols. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated and compared using the log-rank test.\nPatients with low Ki-67 index had a significantly better disease-free-survival (DFS) than patients with high Ki-67 index (hazard ratio=2.85; 95% confidence interval=1.45-5.59; p=0.002). A significant influence on DFS was demonstrated (hazard ratio(HR)=1.02; confidence interval(CI)=1.00-1.04; p=0.048) within the subgroup of hormone receptor-positive and HER2neu-negative patients, but not within the subgroup of those with luminal B\/HER2neu-negative tumors (DFS: p=0.801; overall-survival: p=0.379).\nThe Ki-67 index has a prognostic impact on DFS in patients with hormone receptor-positive and HER2neu-negative tumors. The strict cut-off value was not suitable for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients and their response to adjuvant chemotherapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Thangarajah, Fabinshy","Enninga, Insa","Malter, Wolfram","Hamacher, Stefanie","Markiefka, Birgid","Richters, Lisa","Kr\u00e4mer, Stefan","Mallmann, Peter","Kirn, Verena"],"doi":"10.21873\/anticanres.11536","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T10:27:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"4","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1491388028,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28373466?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28373466","pubdate":"2017-04-05T22:08:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"A Retrospective Analysis of Ki-67 Index and its Prognostic Significance in Over 800 Primary Breast Cancer Cases.","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-analysis-ki67-index-prognostic-significance-800-primary-breast-cancer-cases"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251370,"mean":13.074886776014,"rank":207849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251370,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1807,"mean":3.7424241417497,"rank":1169,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1807,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":7.6932203389831,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
