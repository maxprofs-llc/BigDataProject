The taxonomic community structures of the ectomycorrhizal assemblages in top soil were influenced by stand density and forest type, by biogeographic environmental factors (soil physical properties, temperature, and precipitation), and by nitrogen forms (amino acids, ammonium, and nitrate). While \u03b1-diversity did not differ between forest types, \u03b2-diversity increased, leading to higher \u03b3-diversity on the landscape level when both forest types were present. The highest taxonomic diversity of EM was found in forests in cool, moist climate on clay and silty soils and the lowest in the forests in warm, dry climate on sandy soils. In the region with higher taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic clustering was found, but not trait clustering. In the warm region, trait clustering occurred despite neutral phylogenetic effects. These results suggest that different forest types and favorable environmental conditions in forests promote high EM species richness in top soil presumably with both high functional diversity and phylogenetic redundancy, while stressful environmental conditions lead to lower species richness and functional redundancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000669d","authors":["Rodica Pena","Christa Lang","Gertrud Lohaus","Steffen Boch","Peter Schall","Ingo Sch\u00f6ning","Christian Ammer","Markus Fischer","Andrea Polle"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00572-016-0742-z","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T10:35:22+00:00","issns":["0940-6360","1432-1890"],"journal":"Mycorrhiza","last_mentioned_on":1491388776,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27885418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27885418","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agriculture","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forestry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["botany","microbiology"],"title":"Phylogenetic and functional traits of ectomycorrhizal assemblages in top soil from different biogeographic regions and forest types","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogenetic-functional-traits-ectomycorrhizal-assemblages-top-soil-different-biogeographic-regions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":6420463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1150487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251371,"mean":13.074832772407,"rank":179694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251371,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":2.4723006134969,"rank":204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.88,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
