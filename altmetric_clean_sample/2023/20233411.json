ETEC strains produce the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and\/or heat-stable enterotoxins (ST) and encode a diverse set of colonization factors used for adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. We previously found that ETEC secretes a heat-stable protein we designated as ETEC Secreted Factor (ESF) that inhibits the extent of NF-\u03baB activation normally induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). Here we fractionated ETEC supernatants using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and determined that ETEC flagellin was necessary and sufficient to protect I\u03baB\u03b1 from degradation in response to TNF stimulation. These data suggest a potentially novel mechanism by which ETEC may evade the host innate immune response by down-regulating NF-\u03baB-dependent host responses.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f1a","authors":["Gaochan Wang","Brian Geisbrecht","Christian Rueter","Philip Hardwidge"],"doi":"10.3390\/pathogens6020018","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T14:26:27+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"handles":[],"issns":["2076-0817"],"issue":"2","journal":"Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1495477760,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/6\/2\/18?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/6\/2\/18\/htm","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/pathogens6020018"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-0817\/6\/2\/18\/pdf","pmid":"28513540","pubdate":"2017-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Flagellin Inhibits TNF-Induced NF-\u03baB Activation in Intestinal Epithelial Cells","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enterotoxigenic-escherichia-coli-flagellin-inhibits-tnfinduced-nf%CE%BAb-activation-intestinal-epithelial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":5966055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1990608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238117,"mean":12.258847570092,"rank":153220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238117,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":2.9812906976744,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.7145454545455,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
