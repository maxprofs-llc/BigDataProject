Despite evidences indicate a close relationship between testosterone and glucose metabolism, the molecular mechanisms responsible for a possible testosterone-mediated insulin-like effects on skeletal muscle are still unknown.\nHere we used undifferentiated proliferating or differentiated human fetal skeletal muscle cells (Hfsmc) to investigate the short-term effects of testosterone on the insulin-mediated biomolecular metabolic machinery. GLUT4 cell expression, localization and the phosphorylation\/activation of AKT, ERK, mTOR and GSK3\u03b2 insulin-related pathways at different time points after treatment with testosterone were analyzed.\nIndependently from cells differentiation status, testosterone, with an insulin-like effect, induced Glut4-mRNA expression, GLUT4 protein translocation to the cytoplasmic membrane, while no effect was observed on GLUT4 protein expression levels. Furthermore, testosterone treatment modulated the insulin-dependent signal transduction pathways inducing a rapid and persistent activation of AKT, ERK and mTOR, and a transient inhibition of GSK3\u03b2. T-related effects were shown to be androgen receptor dependent.\nAll together our data indicate that testosterone through the activation of non-genomic pathways, participates in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism by inducing insulin-related effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c5b","authors":["C.
