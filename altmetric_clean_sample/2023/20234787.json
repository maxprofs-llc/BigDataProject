Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded efficiently onto DNA origami through base pair intercalation and surface-modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) were assembled onto the DNA origami through DNA hybridization. Due to the active targeting effect of the assembled aptamers, the multifunctional nanostructures achieved increased cellular internalization of DOX and AuNRs. Upon near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, the P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance pump) expression of multidrug resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7\/ADR) cells was down-regulated, achieving the synergistically chemotherapeutic (DOX) and photothermal (AuNRs) effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Linlin Song","Qiao Jiang","Jianbing Liu","Na Li","Qing Liu","Luru Dai","Yuan Gao","Wei-li Liu","Dongsheng Liu","Baoquan Ding"],"doi":"10.1039\/c7nr02222k","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T14:44:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2040-3364","2040-3372"],"journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1495296060,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2017\/NR\/C7NR02222K","http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/-\/content\/articlelanding\/2017\/nr\/c7nr02222k#!divAbstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2017\/nr\/c7nr02222k","pmid":"28581004","pubdate":"2017-05-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"DNA Origami\/Gold Nanorods Hybrid Nanostructures for the Circumvention of Drug Resistance","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-origamigold-nanorod-hybrid-nanostructures-circumvention-drug-resistance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":5962230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1988476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237456,"mean":12.265660221937,"rank":152889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":70711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237456,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2252,"mean":4.6969124833407,"rank":1276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2252,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":4.4067225806452,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
