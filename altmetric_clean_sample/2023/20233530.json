The work presented in this paper underlines gamification as a concept and uses VR as a new modality to study the human skeleton. The team proposes a mobile Android platform application based on Unity 5.4 editor and Google VR SDK. The results confirmed that the approach provides a more intuitive user experience during the learning process, concluding that the gamification of classical medical software provides an increased interactivity level for medical students during the study of the human skeleton.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67f3cf058f6100098a4","authors":["Nicola, Stelian","Virag, Ioan","Stoicu-Tivadar, L\u0103cr\u0103mioara"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T14:27:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0926-9630"],"journal":"Studies in Health Technology & Informatics","last_mentioned_on":1495055855,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28508784?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28508784?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pmid":"28508784","pubdate":"2017-05-17T22:05:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","medicalinformatics"],"title":"VR Medical Gamification for Training and Education.","type":"article","volume":"236","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vr-medical-gamification-training-education"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4132472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233549,"mean":12.370935002655,"rank":117881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":105735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233549,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1132,"mean":1.6911564986737,"rank":347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1132,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.2455882352941,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Computer Science":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"FI":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FamilyVGExperts\/statuses\/864849895659757569","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20233530],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T14:27:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Family Video Games","url":"http:\/\/www.FamilyVideoGameMonth.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1615765719\/Skylanders_Family_Playing-01_normal.jpg","description":"An alliance of experts from around the globe recommending video games for families.
