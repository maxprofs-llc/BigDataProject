Results were compared with commercial tests for the detection of IgG and IgM and their overall clinical final interpretation of a complete serological profile. The IgG and IgM test results on the platform were in agreement in, respectively, 95% and 93% with the commercial kits. When comparing with the overall clinical interpretation of the serological profile, the agreement reached 99.5% and 97.7% for IgG and IgM, respectively. This innovative pGOLD platform allows detection of both IgG and IgM simultaneously with only ~1 microliter of serum. The multiplexed IgG\/IgM test on pGOLD platform is a strong candidate for its use in the massive screening programs for toxoplasmosis during pregnancy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ff","authors":["Christelle Pomares","Bo Zhang","Shylaja Arulkumar","Geraldine Gonfrier","Pierre Marty","Su Zhao","Steven Cheng","Meijie Tang","Hongjie Dai","Jose G.
