For a comparison, a ZnO film layer with a thickness of 30 nm was also coated onto an ST-cut quartz SAW device using a sol-gel and spin-coating technique. The ammonia sensing results showed that the sensitivity, repeatability and stability of the ZnO NR-coated SAW device were superior to those of the ZnO film-coated SAW device due to the large surface-to-volume ratio of the ZnO NRs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Wei Li","Yuanjun Guo","Yongliang Tang","Xiaotao Zu","Jinyi Ma","Lu Wang","Yong Fu"],"doi":"10.3390\/s17051142","first_seen_on":"2017-05-17T14:26:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"5","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1495031176,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/5\/1142?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/17\/5\/1142\/pdf","pmid":"28513538","pubdate":"2017-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Room-Temperature Ammonia Sensor Based on ZnO Nanorods Deposited on ST-Cut Quartz Surface Acoustic Wave Devices","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roomtemperature-ammonia-sensor-based-zno-nanorods-deposited-stcut-quartz-surface-acoustic-wave-devic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":7112909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233549,"mean":12.370971183654,"rank":189891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233549,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3385,"mean":1.9440508274232,"rank":2365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":1.805261663286,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/864849555577118720","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20233416],"posted_on":"2017-05-17T14:26:16+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
