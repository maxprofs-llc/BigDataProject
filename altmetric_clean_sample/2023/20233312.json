These bis(trithio)phosphines and the related intermediate diphosphine species are characterized by X-ray diffraction and multinuclear NMR and a mechanism is proposed for the formation of these molecules. In contrast, the related reaction with diphenyldisulfide produces a mononuclear tris(phenylthio)phosphine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Stephanie C Kosnik","Maxemilian C.
