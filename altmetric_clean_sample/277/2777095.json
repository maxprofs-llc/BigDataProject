This antibiotic family, with more than 100 known members, is characterized by the presence of sulfur-containing heterocyclic rings and dehydrated residues within a macrocyclic peptide structure. Thiopeptides, including micrococcin P1, have garnered significant attention in recent years for their potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi and even protozoa. Micrococcin P1 is known to target the ribosome; however, like other thiopeptides, its biosynthesis and mechanisms of self-immunity are poorly characterized. We have discovered an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harboring the genes for thiopeptide production and self-protection on a 24-kb plasmid. Here we report the characterization of this plasmid, identify the antimicrobial peptide that it encodes, and provide evidence of a target replacement-mediated mechanism of self-immunity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["Philip R Bennallack","Scott R Burt","Michael J Heder","Richard A Robison","Joel S Griffitts"],"doi":"10.1128\/jb.02243-14","first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T10:27:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5530","0021-9193"],"journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1417003200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25313391?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/early\/2014\/10\/03\/JB.02243-14.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/JB.02243-14","http:\/\/jb.asm.org\/content\/196\/24\/4344.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25313391"],"pmid":"25313391","pubdate":"2014-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Characterization of a Novel Plasmid-Borne Thiopeptide Gene Cluster in Staphylococcus epidermidis Strain 115","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-novel-plasmidborne-thiopeptide-gene-cluster-staphylococcus-epidermidis-strain-115"},"altmetric_score":{"score":48.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":48.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4553834,"mean":5.3241366058634,"rank":73636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4480129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4553834,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121513,"mean":8.6005930607677,"rank":4186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":117325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121513,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3457,"mean":2.7655086805556,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":3449,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3457,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.1367647058824,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
