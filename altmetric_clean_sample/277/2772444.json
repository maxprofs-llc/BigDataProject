What is largely unknown is how these molecular influences shape neural activity in different brain areas. The clock gene Per2 is rhythmically expressed in the striatum and the cerebellum and its expression is linked with daily fluctuations in extracellular dopamine levels and D2 receptor activity. Electrophysiologically, dopamine depletion enhances striatal local field potential (LFP) oscillations. We investigated if LFP oscillations and synchrony were influenced by time of day, potentially via dopamine mechanisms. To assess the presence of a diurnal effect, oscillatory power and coherence were examined in the striatum and cerebellum of rats under urethane anesthesia at four different times of day zeitgeber time (ZT1, 7, 13 and 19-indicating number of hours after lights turned on in a 12:12 h light-dark cycle). We also investigated the diurnal response to systemic raclopride, a D2 receptor antagonist. Time of day affected the proportion of LFP oscillations within the 0-3 Hz band and the 3-8 Hz band. In both the striatum and the cerebellum, slow oscillations were strongest at ZT1 and weakest at ZT13. A 3-8 Hz oscillation was present when the slow oscillation was lowest, with peak 3-8 Hz activity occurring at ZT13. Raclopride enhanced the slow oscillations, and had the greatest effect at ZT13. Within the striatum and with the cerebellum, 0-3 Hz coherence was greatest at ZT1, when the slow oscillations were strongest. Coherence was also affected the most by raclopride at ZT13. Our results suggest that neural oscillations in the cerebellum and striatum, and the synchrony between these areas, are modulated by time of day, and that these changes are influenced by dopamine manipulation. This may provide insight into how circadian gene transcription patterns influence network electrophysiology. Future experiments will address how these network alterations are linked with behavior.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc1d","authors":["Ariana Frederick","Jonathan Bourget-Murray","C Andrew Chapman","Shimon Amir","Richard Courtemanche"],"doi":"10.3389\/fnsys.2014.00145","first_seen_on":"2014-10-14T10:18:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5137"],"journal":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1413282250,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25309348?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25309348","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Diurnal influences on electrophysiological oscillations and coupling in the dorsal striatum and cerebellar cortex of the anesthetized rat.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diurnal-influences-electrophysiological-oscillations-coupling-dorsal-striatum-cerebellar-cortex-anes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4366944,"mean":4.8710648140238,"rank":3180438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":954923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4366944,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117775,"mean":7.7194628186188,"rank":82128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":27838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117775,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":6.5251953578337,"rank":439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":63,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":8.1116862745098,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
