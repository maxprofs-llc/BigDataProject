The addition of telaprevir or boceprevir seems to increase this risk but there are no studies yet to compare the infection rate between both treatments. We aimed to assess the rate, type and predictive factors of infections in cirrhotic patients undergoing triple or double antiviral therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ddb","doi":"10.1016\/j.jhep.2014.09.025","first_seen_on":"2014-10-13T19:09:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0168-8278"],"journal":"Journal of Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1423073709,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journal-of-hepatology.eu%2Farticle%2FS0168-8278%252814%252900716-8%2Fabstract&code=jhepat-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journal-of-hepatology.eu\/article\/S0168827814007168\/pdf","pmid":"25281861","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"The Addition of a Protease Inhibitor Increases the Risk of Infections in Patients with Hepatitis C-Related Cirrhosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addition-protease-inhibitor-increases-risk-infections-patients-hepatitis-crelated-cirrhosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4715546,"mean":5.6954923819015,"rank":2343649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2229882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4715546,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127085,"mean":8.7270012275348,"rank":60132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":61464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127085,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1296,"mean":4.5575150579151,"rank":761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1296,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.6133333333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":51}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
