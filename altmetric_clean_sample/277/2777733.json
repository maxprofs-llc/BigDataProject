Here, we show robust transforming activity of sTAg in vivo in a panel of transgenic mouse models. Epithelia of pre-term sTAg-expressing embryos exhibited hyperplasia, impaired differentiation, increased proliferation and apoptosis, and activation of a DNA damage response. Epithelial transformation did not require sTAg interaction with the PP2A protein complex, a tumor suppressor in some other polyomavirus transformation models, but was strictly dependent on a recently-described sTAg domain that binds Fbxw7, the substrate-binding component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Postnatal induction of sTAg using a Cre-inducible transgene also led to epithelial transformation with development of lesions resembling squamous cell carcinoma in situ and elevated expression of Fbxw7 target proteins. Our data establish that expression of MCPyV sTAg alone is sufficient for rapid neoplastic transformation in vivo, implicating sTAg as an oncogenic driver in MCC and perhaps other human malignancies. Moreover, the loss of transforming activity following mutation of the sTAg LSD identifies this domain as crucial for in vivo transformation.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 14 October 2014. doi:10.1038\/jid.2014.446.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e0e","authors":["Monique E Verhaegen","Doris Mangelberger","Paul W Harms","Tracy D Vozheiko","Jack W Weick","Dawn M Wilbert","Thomas L Saunders","Alexandre N Ermilov","Christopher K Bichakjian","Timothy M Johnson","Michael J Imperiale","Andrzej A Dlugosz","Verhaegen ME","Mangelberger D","Harms PW","Vozheiko TD","Weick JW","Wilbert DM","Saunders TL","Ermilov AN","Bichakjian CK","Johnson TM","Imperiale MJ","Dlugosz AA","Monique E.
