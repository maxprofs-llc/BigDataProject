These parameters were measured after feeding the carp fry with the experimental diets for 7 weeks. Dietary FOS supplementation had no significant effects on the growth performance and food intake of carp fry compared with the control treatment. It also had no significant effects on the following haematological parameters: erythrocyte count; leucocyte counts (WBC); haematocrit; Hb; mean corpuscular volume; mean corpuscular Hb content; mean corpuscular Hb concentration. However, WBC and respiratory burst activity were significantly affected by dietary FOS supplementation. Evaluation of the cultivable autochthonous intestinal microbiota revealed a significant increase in the levels of total viable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in fish fed diets supplemented with 2 and 3\u00a0% FOS. Furthermore, dietary FOS supplementation significantly increased the survival rate and stress resistance of carp fry compared with the control treatment. These results encourage conducting further research on the administration of FOS and other prebiotics in carp fry studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Seyed Hossein Hoseinifar","Narges Soleimani","Einar Ring\u00f8"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007114514002037","first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T10:10:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2662"],"issue":"8","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1413367816,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25313574?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25313574","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Effects of dietary fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation on the growth performance, haemato-immunological parameters, gut microbiota and stress resistance of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fry.","type":"article","volume":"112","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-dietary-fructooligosaccharide-supplementation-growth-performance-haematoimmunological-parame-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508238,"mean":5.1674528195662,"rank":2278959,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":1654785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508238,"percentile":36},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120958,"mean":8.4426696263964,"rank":60806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":47564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120958,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2393,"mean":6.3648110367893,"rank":1546,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":647,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2393,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":6.9393103448276,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
