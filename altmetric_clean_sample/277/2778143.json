According to the findings, quercetin with the concentrations between 51.74 micromol x L(-1) and 827.81 micromol x L(-1) had no significant effect on the activity of cardiac fibroblasts. Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20.70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 36 h (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of IL-6 induced LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 36 h (P < 0.05), without any notable effect of quercetin with the concentration of 20.70 micromol x L(-1). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20. 70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the NF-kappaB p65 (S276) activation induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 15 min, with the most significant effect in 20.70 micromol x L(-1). Quercetin with the concentrations of 82.78, 41.39, 20.70 micromol x L(-1) could notably inhibit the increase of p-Akt(473) expression induced by LPS 100 microg x L(-1) for 3 h and then ATP 5 mmol x L(-1) for 240 min (P < 0.05). Therefore, this study believes that quercetin could attenuate the secretion of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 of cardiac fibroblasts by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB p65 (S276) and Akt (473).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc89","authors":["Tang XL","Liu JX","Dong W","Li P","Li L","Zheng YQ","Hou JC"],"first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T14:50:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"12","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi China journal of Chinese materia medica","last_mentioned_on":1413383463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25244766?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25244766","pubdate":"2014-09-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies","pharmacology"],"title":"[Intervention effect of quercetin on inflammatory secretion of cardiac fibroblasts].","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intervention-effect-quercetin-inflammatory-secretion-cardiac-fibroblasts"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139307,"mean":8.6168870974691,"rank":111858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139307,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":0.76767800453515,"rank":152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":0.47461538461538,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
