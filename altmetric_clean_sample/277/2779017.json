Nearly all female players playing in the highest Spanish volleyball league during season 2003\/2004 participated in this study (N=148 elite players, 92% of the total). Anthropometric, body composition and somatotype parameters according to performance and playing positions were analysed. The players' characteristics were as follows; body mass 72.3 \u00b1 8.4 kg; stature 179.8 \u00b1 7.1 cm; body fat 24.0 \u00b1 3.1% and skeletal muscle mass 27.3 \u00b1 2.9 kg. Mean somatotype was 3.1 \u00b1 0.7; 3.4 \u00b1 0.9; 3.1 \u00b1 0.9 characterised as central with a tendency to balanced mesomorph. Top level players (whose teams were better classified in the team performance ranking) were taller, had higher skeletal muscle mass and ectomorphy, and had a lower level of adiposity markers, compared with lower level players. Players selected for their respective National teams (individual performance) were taller, heavier, had higher muscle mass and lower endomorphy than non-selected players. Differences according to playing positions were found. This study provides a complete set of reference data on anthropometry, body composition and somatotype of elite female volleyball players. Morphological differences have been identified according to performance level and playing position.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150d","authors":["Mart\u00edn-Matillas M","Valad\u00e9s D","Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez E","Olea-Serrano F","Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m M","Delgado-Fern\u00e1ndez M","Ortega FB"],"doi":"10.1080\/02640414.2013.809472","first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T20:08:32+00:00","issns":["0264-0414"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Sports Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1413403701,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23879184?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23879184","pubdate":"2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Anthropometric, body composition and somatotype characteristics of elite female volleyball players from the highest Spanish league.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anthropometric-body-composition-somatotype-characteristics-elite-female-volleyball-players-highest-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6976109,"mean":6.2349396586154,"rank":5212113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":989878,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6976109,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191961,"mean":7.5642617732863,"rank":124120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":38911,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191961,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1986,"mean":11.917782367758,"rank":1788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1986,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":11.126857142857,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
