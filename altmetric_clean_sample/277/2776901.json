The completion of a screening tool is an important first step in improving responsiveness to cancer-related distress, but screening must be followed with skilled supportive care to make a difference in patient-reported outcomes. Our objective was to create a web-based education program to support nurses and other frontline staff in providing an initial response to screening results.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c08","authors":["McLeod DL","Morck AC","Curran JA"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1478951513000072","first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T10:03:41+00:00","issns":["1478-9515"],"issue":"","journal":"Palliative & Supportive Care","last_mentioned_on":1438087661,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23942172?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23942172","pubdate":"2013-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"A pan-Canadian web-based education program to support screening for distress: Evaluation of outcomes.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pancanadian-webbased-education-program-support-screening-distress-evaluation-outcomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5422669,"mean":6.3136254220255,"rank":2855284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2542951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5422669,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":147269,"mean":8.6344694706252,"rank":75235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":71251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":147269,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286,"mean":2.8804210526316,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":4.3863333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
