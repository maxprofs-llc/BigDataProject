Furthermore, MRSA-induced soft tissue infections can rapidly progress into life-threatening conditions, such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. The importance of neutrophils in these devastating soft tissue infections remains ambiguous, partly because of our incomplete understanding of their behaviour. Spinning disk confocal microscopy was used to visualize the behaviour of GR1-labelled neutrophils in subcutaneous tissue in response to GFP-expressing MRSA attached to a foreign particle (agarose bead). We observed significant directional neutrophil recruitment towards the S. aureus agarose bead but not a control agarose bead. A significant increase in neutrophil crawling within the capillaries surrounding the infectious nidus was noted, with impaired capillary perfusion in these vessels and increased parenchymal cell death. No neutrophils were able to emigrate from capillaries. The crawling within these capillaries was mediated by the \u03b22 and \u03b14 integrins and blocking these integrins 2 hours post infection eliminated neutrophil crawling, improved capillary perfusion, reduced cell death and reduced lesion size. Blocking prior to infection increased pathology. Neutrophil crawling within capillaries during MRSA soft tissue infections, while potentially contributing to walling off or preventing early dissemination of the pathogen, resulted in impaired perfusion and increased tissue injury with time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Mark Geoffrey Harding","Kunyan Zhang","John Conly","Paul Kubes"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1004379","first_seen_on":"2014-10-15T20:31:47+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"10","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1435184643,"links":["http:\/\/www.plospathogens.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1004379","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1004379","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004379"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1004379.pdf","pmid":"25299673","pubdate":"2014-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1004379","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Neutrophil Crawling in Capillaries; A Novel Immune Response to  Staphylococcus aureus ","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neutrophil-crawling-capillaries-novel-immune-response-staphylococcus-aureus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":1074971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6982260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197309,"mean":7.8798956960693,"rank":30763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":166479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197309,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4785,"mean":13.373091137124,"rank":1588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":3193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4785,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":12.131208053691,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
