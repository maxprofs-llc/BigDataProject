The ankle range of motion being relatively small, the use of preloading allows to measure maximal strength throughout the whole amplitude and therefore to better characterize ankle muscles weaknesses. This study aimed to assess muscle strength of the injured and uninjured ankles in subjects with a lateral ankle sprain, to document the timeline of strength recovery, and to determine the influence of sprain grade on strength loss.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377e","authors":["Perron M","Moffet H","Nadeau S","H\u00e9bert LJ","Belzile S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinbiomech.2014.09.010","first_seen_on":"2014-10-14T11:20:28+00:00","issns":["0268-0033"],"issue":"10","journal":"Clinical Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1450008205,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinbiomech.com%2Farticle%2FS0268-0033%252814%252900222-8%2Fabstract&code=jclb-site","http:\/\/www.clinbiomech.com\/article\/S0268-0033(14)00222-8\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25451862"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.clinbiomech.com\/article\/S0268003314002228\/pdf","pmid":"25451862","pubdate":"2014-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","physiology"],"title":"Persistence of long term isokinetic strength deficits in subjects with lateral ankle sprain as measured with a protocol including maximal preloading.","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/persistence-long-term-isokinetic-strength-deficits-subjects-lateral-ankle-sprain-measured-protocol-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":1304173,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5435529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191340,"mean":7.5261647337973,"rank":41812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":149391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191340,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":777,"mean":4.9869948453608,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":777,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.31875,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
