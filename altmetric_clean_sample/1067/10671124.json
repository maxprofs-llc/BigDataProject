However, tests for these biomarkers can vary in quality, and evidence of their clinical value may be lacking. A recently issued report from the Institute of Medicine outlines 10 interrelated recommendations to resolve these and other concerns about biomarker testing-and more fully implement personalized medicine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcb","doi":"10.1158\/2159-8290.cd-nd2016-003","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T08:30:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2159-8290"],"journal":"Cancer Discovery","last_mentioned_on":1471509008,"links":["http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/17\/2159-8290.CD-ND2016-003.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"27535105","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Ten Steps to Advance Biomarker Testing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ten-steps-advance-biomarker-testing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":4382040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2293875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253828,"mean":12.210471447088,"rank":139648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":88491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253828,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1509,"mean":7.8607824933687,"rank":710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":645,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1509,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":6.1686753246753,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/canceresaude\/statuses\/766190428886487040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10671124],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T08:30:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Geraldo - C&S","url":"http:\/\/www.canceresaude.com.br","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/817904130299752448\/-J4xkp-Z_normal.jpg","description":"Twitter do blog C\u00e2ncer e Sa\u00fade - Orientado para divulga\u00e7\u00e3o de noticias de c\u00e2ncer e sa\u00fade.","id_on_source":"canceresaude","tweeter_id":"998207239","geo":{"lt":-30.03306,"ln":-51.23,"country":"BR"},"followers":63},"tweet_id":"766190428886487040"}]}}
