Vaginal swabs were obtained at 1 and 3 months. All participants were notified of positive STIs at 1 and 3 months and treatment arranged. Data were analyzed with logistic regression for comparison of treatment status by number of nurse contacts. Results Over the 3-month period, 59 participants (38.6%) tested positive for one or more STIs and all received notification. Only 50% (19\/38) of participants with STI at 1 month and 43% (16\/37) at 3 months received treatment. Conclusions Despite the high notification rate of positive test results for young adults with recurrent STIs, many failed to seek treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002570","authors":["Butz, Arlene M","Gaydos, Charlotte","Chung, Shang-En","Johnson, Betty H","Huettner, Steven","Trent, Maria"],"doi":"10.1177\/0009922816662863","first_seen_on":"2016-08-18T10:01:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-2707","0009-9228"],"journal":"Clinical Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1473765599,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27507807"],"pmid":"27507807","pubdate":"2016-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Care-Seeking Behavior After Notification Among Young Women With Recurrent Sexually Transmitted Infections After Pelvic Inflammatory Disease","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/careseeking-behavior-after-notification-among-young-women-recurrent-sexually-transmitted-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":3393096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4953584,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255046,"mean":12.218231951224,"rank":92660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":161000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255046,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1006,"mean":5.546392039801,"rank":522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1006,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.78768,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sex_Worker_Hlth\/statuses\/766213207010775040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10673714],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T10:00:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Sex_Worker_Hlth","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781973423\/ruth-palmer-deep-purple-mist_normal.jpg","description":"Commercial Sex Worker Health Information.
