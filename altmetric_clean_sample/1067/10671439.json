The products [1-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-3-dppe-3,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (1), [2-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-4-dppe-4,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (2), [8-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-2-dmpe-2,1,8-closo-NiC2B9H10] (3), [1-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-3,3-(PMe3)2-3,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (4), [1-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-3,3-(PMe2Ph)2-3,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (6), [1-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-3,3-{P(OMe)3}2-3,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (9) and [1-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-2,2-{P(OMe)3}2-2,1,8-closo-NiC2B9H10] (10) were fully characterised spectroscopically and crystallographically, whilst [2-(1'-1',2'-closo-C2B10H11)-4,4-(PMePh2)2-4,1,2-closo-NiC2B9H10] (8) was characterised spectroscopically. Overall the results suggest that an important factor in a 3,1,2 to 4,1,2 isomerisation is the relief gained from steric crowding, whereas a 3,1,2 to 2,1,8 isomerisation appears to be favoured by strongly electron-donating ligands on the metal.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Dipendu Mandal","Wing Y Man","Georgina Rosair","Alan Jeffrey Welch","Wing.
