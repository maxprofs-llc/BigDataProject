However, the quality, quantity and confidence of summarized taxonomic abundances are in need of further scrutiny due to sample dependent and independent effects. In this article we introduce 'AVIT (Abundance and Variability In Taxonomy), an unbiased method to enrich for assigned members of microbial communities. As opposed to using a priori thresholds, 'AVIT uses inherent abundance and variability of taxa in a dataset to determine the inclusion or rejection of each taxa for further downstream analysis. Using in-vitro and in-vivo studies, we benchmarked performance and parameterized 'AVIT to establish a framework for investigating the dynamic range of microbial community membership in clinically relevant scenarios.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Chakrabarti, Anirikh","Siddharth, Jay","Lauber, Christian L","Membrez, Mathieu","Betrisey, Bertrand","Loyer, Carole","Chou, Chieh Jason","Pataky, Zoltan","Golay, Alain","Parkinson, Scott J","Anirikh Chakrabarti","Jay Siddharth","Christian L.
