After ignition of the plasma, a stable and continuous operation of the plasma is possible and the plasma torch can be used for many different applications. On one hand, the hot (3,600 K gas temperature) plasma can be used for chemical processes and on the other hand the cold afterglow (temperatures down to almost RT) can be applied for surface processes. For example chemical syntheses are interesting volume processes. Here the microwave plasma torch can be used for the decomposition of waste gases which are harmful and contribute to the global warming but are needed as etching gases in growing industry sectors like the semiconductor branch. Another application is the dissociation of CO2. Surplus electrical energy from renewable energy sources can be used to dissociate CO2 to CO and O2. The CO can be further processed to gaseous or liquid higher hydrocarbons thereby providing chemical storage of the energy, synthetic fuels or platform chemicals for the chemical industry. Applications of the afterglow of the plasma torch are the treatment of surfaces to increase the adhesion of lacquer, glue or paint, and the sterilization or decontamination of different kind of surfaces. The movie will explain how to ignite the plasma solely by microwave power without any additional igniters, e.g., electric sparks. The microwave plasma torch is based on a combination of two resonators - a coaxial one which provides the ignition of the plasma and a cylindrical one which guarantees a continuous and stable operation of the plasma after ignition. The plasma can be operated in a long microwave transparent tube for volume processes or shaped by orifices for surface treatment purposes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f23","authors":["Martina Leins","Sandra Gaiser","Andreas Schulz","Matthias Walker","Uwe Schumacher","Thomas Hirth"],"doi":"10.3791\/52816","first_seen_on":"2015-04-16T19:38:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1940-087X"],"issue":"98","journal":"Journal of Visualized Experiments","last_mentioned_on":1429213204,"links":["http:\/\/www.jove.com\/video\/52816\/how-to-ignite-an-atmospheric-pressure-microwave-plasma-torch-without"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jove.com\/pdf\/52816.pdf","pmid":"25938699","pubdate":"2015-05-06T22:03:08+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","biology"],"title":"How to Ignite an Atmospheric Pressure Microwave Plasma Torch without Any Additional Igniters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ignite-atmospheric-pressure-microwave-plasma-torch-without-additional-igniters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5421329,"mean":6.3116136326739,"rank":2879215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1842540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5421329,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150117,"mean":10.323409096965,"rank":87580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":47867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150117,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3495,"mean":3.0568792215226,"rank":1745,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3495,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":1.8348505747126,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
