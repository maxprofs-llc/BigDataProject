We tested the null hypothesis of (1) no significant abatement of the sealant after 26\u00a0weeks in fixed orthodontic treatment compared to baseline, and (2) no significant influence of the factor of brushing and oral hygiene (as screened by approximal plaque index, API) on the abatement of the sealant.\nIntegrity and abatement of OpalSeal applicated directly following bracketing was assessed in thirty-six consecutive patients (nteeth\u2009=\u2009796) undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances (male\/female12\/24; mean age\/SD 14.4\/1.33 Y). Assessment of the fluorescing sealant preservation was by a black-light lamp, using a classification that was concepted in analogy to the ARI index: (3, sealant completely preserved; 2=\u2009>\u200950% preserved; 1\u2009=\u2009<50%; 0\u2009=\u2009no sealant observable) immediately following application (Baseline, T0), after 2 (T1), 8 (T2), 14 (T3), 20 (T4) and 26\u00a0weeks (T5). API was assessed at T0 and T1. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA (\u03b1\u2009=\u20095%, power >80%).\nAt baseline, 43.4% of teeth had a positive API. Oral hygiene deteriorated after bracketing (T1, 53%) significantly. Null hypothesis (1) was rejected, while (2) was accepted: Mean values of both the well brushed and non-brushed anterior teeth undercut the score \"1\" at T3 (week 14). Despite a slightly better preservation of the sealer before and after T3 in not-sufficiently brushed (API-positive) teeth, this finding was statistically not significant.\nOne single application of OpalSeal is unlikely to last throughout the entire fixed appliance treatment stage. On average, re-application of the sealant can be expected to be necessary after 3.5\u00a0months (week 14) in treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000829","authors":["Michael Kn\u00f6sel","David Ellenberger","Yvonne G\u00f6ldner","Paulo Sandoval","Dirk Wiechmann"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13005-015-0069-6","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T12:26:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1746-160X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Head & Face Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429302607,"links":["http:\/\/www.head-face-med.com\/content\/11\/1\/11\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.head-face-med.com\/content\/pdf\/s13005-015-0069-6.pdf","pmid":"25890225","pubdate":"2015-04-19T22:00:14+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Otorhinolaryngology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","dentistry","orthopedics"],"title":"In-vivo durability of a fluoride-releasing sealant (OpalSeal) for protection against white-spot lesion formation in orthodontic patients","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invivo-durability-fluoridereleasing-sealant-opalseal-protection-against-whitespot-lesion-formation-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5005286,"mean":5.9289204970384,"rank":2482680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2370672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5005286,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153609,"mean":9.832494284152,"rank":81514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":65255,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153609,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":1.4828452380952,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.025,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":3,"Student  > Master":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Ph.
