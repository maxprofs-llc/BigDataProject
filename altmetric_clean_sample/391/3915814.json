This study investigated reliability and acceptability of the postgraduate admissions MMI with PBQ and SQ interview formats within MMI stations.\nTwenty-six Japanese medical graduates, first completed the two-year national obligatory initial postgraduate clinical training programme and then applied to three specialty training programmes - internal medicine, general surgery, and emergency medicine - in a Japanese teaching hospital, where they underwent the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-competency-based MMI. This MMI contained five stations, with two examiners per station. In each station, a PBQ, and then an SQ were asked consecutively. PBQ and SQ interview formats were not separated into two different stations, or the order of questioning of PBQs and SQs in individual stations was not changed due to lack of space and experienced examiners. Reliability was analysed for the scores of these two MMI question types. Candidates and examiners were surveyed on this experience.\nThe PBQ and SQ formats had generalisability coefficients of 0.822 and 0.821, respectively. With one examiner per station, seven stations could produce a reliability of more than 0.80 in both PBQ and SQ formats. More than 60% of both candidates and examiners felt positive about the overall candidates' ability. All participants liked the fairness of this MMI when compared with the previously experienced SSPI. SQs were perceived more favourable by candidates; in contrast, PBQs were perceived more relevant by examiners.\nBoth PBQs and SQs are equally reliable and acceptable as station interview formats in the postgraduate admissions MMI. However, the use of the two formats within the same station, and with a fixed order, is not the best to maximise its utility as an admission test. Future studies are required to evaluate how best the SQs and PBQs should be combined as station interview formats to enhance reliability, feasibility, acceptability and predictive validity of the MMI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bf","authors":["Hiroshi Yoshimura","Hidetaka Kitazono","Shigeki Fujitani","Junji Machi","Takuya Saiki","Yasuyuki Suzuki","Gominda Ponnamperuma"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12909-015-0361-y","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T00:34:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6920"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Medical Education","last_mentioned_on":1429624808,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/15\/75\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12909-015-0361-y.pdf","pmid":"25890189","pubdate":"2015-04-19T22:00:15+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education"],"title":"Past-behavioural versus situational questions in a postgraduate admissions multiple mini-interview: a reliability and acceptability comparison","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pastbehavioural-versus-situational-questions-postgraduate-admissions-multiple-miniinterview-reliabil"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5021506,"mean":5.947680814023,"rank":3552114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":823062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5021506,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153899,"mean":9.842597421669,"rank":113067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153899,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":920,"mean":4.5421741022851,"rank":767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":69,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":920,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":4.8428571428571,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
