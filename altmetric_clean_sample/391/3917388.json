After completion of therapy, many of these survivors will face a lifelong risk of endocrine late effects. We summarise the available evidence related to the prevalence and risk factors for endocrine late effects among adult survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer. Present screening, surveillance, and treatment recommendations differ by country and region, so we also highlight the continued effort to harmonise the international guidelines for this population.","altmetric_jid":"5225ed143cf058d06f000000","authors":["Tonorezos, Emily S","Hudson, Melissa M","Edgar, Angela B","Kremer, Leontien C","Sklar, Charles A","Wallace, W Hamish B","Oeffinger, Kevin C","Emily S Tonorezos","Melissa M Hudson","Angela B Edgar","Leontien C Kremer","Charles A Sklar","W Hamish B Wallace","Kevin C Oeffinger"],"doi":"10.1016\/s2213-8587(15)00038-8","endpage":"555","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T10:51:37+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2213-8595","2213-8587","22138587"],"issue":"7","journal":"The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1443705421,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25873569?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/landia\/article\/PIIS2213-8587%2815%2900038-8\/fulltext?elsca1=etoc&elsca2=email&elsca3=2213-8587_201507_3_7_&elsca4=Respiratory%2FPulmonary+Medicine%7CInternal%2FFamily+Medicine%7CAllergy+and+Clinical+Immunology%7CLancet","http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/landia\/article\/PIIS2213-8587(15)00038-8\/abstract"],"pmid":"25873569","pubdate":"2015-04-17T22:07:08+00:00","startpage":"545","title":"Screening and management of adverse endocrine outcomes in adult survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer ","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S2213858715000388","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-management-adverse-endocrine-outcomes-adult-survivors-childhood-adolescent-cancer-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6896042,"mean":6.1898417149761,"rank":3172174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3541099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6896042,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197629,"mean":8.8573061610705,"rank":96958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":92402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197629,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":41.835233802817,"rank":585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":49.434193548387,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
