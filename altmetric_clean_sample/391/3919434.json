The reaction of 3 with highly activated magnesium furnished the diborylated magnesium anthracene 4, which was quenched in situ with ethereal HCl to yield cis-9,10-(Bpin)2 -DHA (cis-5, DHA=9,10-dihydroanthracene). Compound cis-5, in turn, can be reduced with Li[AlH4 ] in THF to give its diborate Li2 [cis-9,10-(BH3 )2 -DHA] (Li2 [cis-6]). In the crystal lattice, the THF solvate Li2 [cis-6]\u22c53\u2009THF establishes a dimeric structure with Li-(\u03bc-H)-B coordination modes. Hydride abstraction from Li2 [cis-6] with Me3 SiCl yields the B\uf8ffH\uf8ffB-bridged DHA Li[7]. This product can also be viewed as a unique cyclic B2 H7 (-) derivative with a hydrocarbon backbone. Treatment of Li2 [cis-6] with the stronger hydride abstracting agent Me3 SiOTf (HOTf=trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) in THF affords the THF diadduct of cis-9,10-(BH(OTf))2 -DHA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Pospiech, Steffen","Bolte, Michael","Lerner, Hans\u2010Wolfram","Wagner, Matthias"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201500541","endpage":"8236","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T23:40:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"22","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1429314027,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500541\/abstract;jsessionid=43370B3B09F9CC0631201794AF84A6CF.f02t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201500541\/pdf","pmid":"25892077","pubdate":"2015-04-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"8229","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Diborylated Magnesium Anthracene as Precursor for B2H5\u2212\u2010Bridged 9,10\u2010Dihydroanthracene","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diborylated-magnesium-anthracene-precursor-binf2infhinf5infsupsupbridged-910dihydroanthracene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6363217,"mean":5.9834796354552,"rank":5419609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6363217,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163448,"mean":9.7928554454961,"rank":134700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163448,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2806,"mean":3.6698709447415,"rank":1910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2806,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":3.3403037974684,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
