Our aim was to investigate the association between self-reported psychological distress and risk of dementia-related mortality.\nWe included 31,043 eligible individuals between the ages of 60 and 80 years, at time of examination, from the CONOR (Cohort of Norway) database. They were followed for a period of 17.4 years (mean 11.5 years). The CONOR Mental Health Index, a seven-item self-report scale was used. A cut-off score equal to or above 2.15 on the scale denoted psychological distress. Cox regression was used to assess the association between psychological distress and risk of dementia-related mortality.\nTotal number of registered deaths was 11,762 and 1118 (9.5%) were classified as cases of dementia-related mortality. We found that 2501 individuals (8.1%) had psychological distress, of these, 119 (10.6%) had concomitant dementia-related mortality. Individuals with psychological distress had an increased risk of dementia-related mortality HR = 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.85) after adjusting for age, gender and education. The association remained significant although attenuated when implemented in a full adjusted model, including general health status, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease; hazard ratio, HR = 1.30 (95% CI 1.06-1.59).\nOur results indicate that psychological distress in elderly individuals is associated with increased risk of dementia-related mortality. Individuals at increased risk of dementia may benefit from treatments or interventions that lessen psychological distress, but this needs to be confirmed in future clinical studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f610001785","authors":["Rosness, Tor Atle","Strand, Bj\u00f8rn Heine","Bergem, Astrid Liv Mina","Nafstad, Per","Langballe, Ellen Melbye","Engedal, Knut","Tambs, Kristian","Bjertness, Espen"],"doi":"10.1080\/13607863.2015.1031639","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T15:51:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-6915"],"journal":"Aging &amp; Mental Health","last_mentioned_on":1429228800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25871314"],"pmid":"25871314","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["geriatrics","psychology"],"title":"Association of psychological distress late in life and dementia-related mortality.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-psychological-distress-late-life-dementiarelated-mortality"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5002950,"mean":5.926907258501,"rank":697555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4268166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5002950,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153583,"mean":9.8313221341044,"rank":32044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":120073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153583,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":472,"mean":3.7164755838641,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":472,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":8.9303529411765,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
