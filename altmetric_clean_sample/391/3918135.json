New modelling study"],"citation":{"abstract":"Early life stages of fish are particularly vulnerable to oil spills. Simulations of overlap of fish eggs and larvae with oil from different oil-spill scenarios, both without and with the dispersant Corexit 9500, enable quantitative comparisons of dispersants as a mitigation alternative. We have used model simulations of a blow out of 4500 m3 crude oil per day (Statfjord light crude) for 30 days at three locations along the Norwegian coast. Eggs were released from 9 different known SGs, in the period from March 1st till end of April, and all spawning products were followed for 90 days from the spill start at April 1st independent of time for spawning. We have modelled overlap between spawning products and oil concentrations giving a total polycyclic hydrocarbon (TPAH) concentration of more than 1.0 or 0.1 ppb (\u00b5g\/l). At these orders of magnitude we expect acute mortality or sublethal effects, respectively. In general, adding dispersants results in higher concentrations of TPAHs in a reduced volume of water compared to not adding dispersants. Also, the TPAHs are displaced deeper in the water column. Model simulations of the spill scenarios showed that addition of chemical dispersant in general moderately decreased the fraction of eggs and larvae that were exposed above the selected threshold values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Frode B.
