Health damages can outweigh savings."],"citation":{"abstract":"We develop a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to estimate the operation costs and the air emissions externality costs attributable to new electric vehicle electricity demand under controlled vs. uncontrolled charging schemes. We focus our analysis on the PJM Interconnection and use scenarios that characterize (1) the most recent power plant fleet for which sufficient data are available, (2) a hypothetical 2018 power plant fleet that reflects upcoming plant retirements, and (3) the 2018 fleet with increased wind capacity. We find that controlled electric vehicle charging can reduce associated generation costs by 23%-34% in part by shifting loads to lower-cost, higher-emitting coal plants. This shift results in increased externality costs of health and environmental damages from increased air pollution. On balance, we find that controlled charging of electric vehicles produces negative net social benefits in the recent PJM grid but could have positive net social benefits in a future grid with sufficient coal retirements and wind penetration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Allison Weis","Weis, Allison","Michalek, Jeremy J","Jaramillo, Paulina","Lueken, Roger"],"doi":"10.1021\/es505822f","endpage":"5819","first_seen_on":"2015-04-15T18:11:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5851","0013-936X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1456157134,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/full\/10.1021\/es505822f","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/es505822f","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/es505822f"],"pmid":"25830471","pubdate":"2015-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5813","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Emissions and Cost Implications of Controlled Electric Vehicle Charging in the U.S. PJM Interconnection","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/emissions-cost-implications-controlled-electric-vehicle-charging-pjm-interconnection"},"altmetric_score":{"score":25.688,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":25.688},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7229418,"mean":6.3648808956484,"rank":270771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":6958816,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7229418,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197506,"mean":8.9998280752387,"rank":12038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":185468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197506,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7555,"mean":10.048998146677,"rank":508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7555,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149,"mean":11.522864864865,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":4,"Members of the public":13}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
