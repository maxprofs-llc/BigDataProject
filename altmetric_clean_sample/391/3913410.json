Infantogram showed dextrocardia, hemivertebrae in the thoracic region and cervical spina bifida occulta. The newborn was operated on for the imperforate anus and was discharged in good condition.\nThis case revealed that IM is not safe for the fetus and leads to teratogenicity. Hence, we recommend that pregnant women should not be treated with IM. \u00a9 2015 S.
