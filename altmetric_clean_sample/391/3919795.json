Differentiation of POPH from other causes of pulmonary hypertension, such as volume overload or a hyperdynamic high flow state, is critical because a diagnosis of POPH has significant implications for liver transplant risk stratification, Model for End Stage Liver Disease exception points, and the use of pulmonary arterial hypertension-(PAH) specific therapy. Currently, there are 12 approved medications for the treatment of PAH in the US, and three of these were approved in 2013. This review will discuss the diagnosis, evaluation and management of POPH and the role of recently approved PAH therapies in the treatment of POPH.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d1","authors":["Hilary M DuBrock","Richard N Channick","Michael J Krowka","DuBrock, Hilary M","Channick, Richard N","Krowka, Michael J"],"doi":"10.1586\/17474124.2015.1035647","endpage":"10","first_seen_on":"2015-04-18T04:36:46+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1747-4124","1747-4132"],"issue":"7","journal":"Expert Review of Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1460658038,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/17474124.2015.1035647?ai=9b1e&mi=4ca1o4&af=R&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25882070?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25882070"],"pmid":"25882070","pubdate":"2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"What's new in the treatment of portopulmonary hypertension?","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whats-new-treatment-portopulmonary-hypertension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":3346423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4130522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201585,"mean":8.908222487896,"rank":86426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":111558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201585,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":460,"mean":1.5818169934641,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":460,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ERJournals\/status\/589286336101683202","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3919795],"posted_on":"2015-04-18T04:36:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Expert Reviews","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/page\/ExpertReviews","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000496751182\/2258702d67dd42cedd317fb79fc5212a_normal.jpeg","description":"Expert Reviews is a leading series of 16 journals providing commentary and analysis on modern healthcare","id_on_source":"ERJournals","tweeter_id":"1886949961","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1279},"tweet_id":"589286336101683202"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PH_Papers\/status\/589421265963782144","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3919795],"posted_on":"2015-04-18T13:32:35+00:00","author":{"name":"PHpapers","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamKieff","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/580912794058428416\/h4SJZnKv_normal.jpg","description":"Twitterbot posting PubMeb #pulmonaryhypertension papers https:\/\/github.com\/roblanf\/phypapers #PH","id_on_source":"PH_Papers","tweeter_id":"3116709759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":443},"tweet_id":"589421265963782144"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/712951897703866368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3919795],"posted_on":"2016-03-24T10:39:13+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"712951897703866368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PHAssociation\/statuses\/720678164343742465","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[3919795],"posted_on":"2016-04-14T18:20:38+00:00","author":{"name":"PH Association","url":"http:\/\/www.PHAssociation.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/871822689769406464\/sKh-x6HA_normal.jpg","description":"Pulmonary hypertension is a rare, incurable lung disease affecting people of all ages, races and genders. #PHAssociation #Heart2CurePH","id_on_source":"PHAssociation","tweeter_id":"75315097","geo":{"lt":38.99067,"ln":-77.02609,"country":"US"},"followers":4729},"tweet_id":"720678164343742465"}]}}
