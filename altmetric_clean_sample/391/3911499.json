Our microfluidics based approach did not require special skills or experience in handling protein crystals. We also investigated the effect of stepwise cryoprotection on the quality of protein crystals. Protein crystals with cryoprotection via on-chip manipulation did not show deterioration of crystallographic quality of the protein crystal. The complete diffraction data set of a protein crystal, to determine three-dimensional structure, is obtainable by simple manipulation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Masatoshi Maeki"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00151","first_seen_on":"2015-04-15T19:31:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1429283634,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00151?hootPostID=88d379a9b612df4d61b657039cb98634&","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.5b00151"],"pmid":"25834918","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A Method of Cryoprotection for Protein Crystallography by Using a Microfluidic Chip and Its Application for in Situ X-ray Diffraction Measurements","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/method-cryoprotection-protein-crystallography-using-microfluidic-chip-application-situ-xray-diffract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5005300,"mean":5.928903969976,"rank":2482700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2370672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5005300,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151934,"mean":9.9629164960872,"rank":80669,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":64531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151934,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5388,"mean":2.9091405234825,"rank":2205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5388,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":2.7511494252874,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
