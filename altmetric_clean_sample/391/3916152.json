A signi\ufb01cance level of 0.05 was used for statistical estimations.\nFour hundred and sixty-two responded to at least one moral claim. Two hundred and fifty-eight responded to all four claims without using the option 'neither agree nor disagree' and were classified as 'morally engaged responders'. A majority of these had a pro-abortion moral. The general relationship between moral beliefs and attitudes towards abortion was morally sound. Being 'morally engaged' did not increase the likelihood of reaching moral judgement on whether requests for abortion should be permitted. Education, religion and parenthood were statistically associated with the investigated issues.\nThe direction of causality is discussed with reference to both moral reasoning and moral intuitions. The relationship between normative social behaviour and abortion attitudes is considered.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e41","authors":["Sigurd Wiingaard Uldall"],"doi":"10.1136\/medethics-2014-102102","first_seen_on":"2015-04-17T01:41:50+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-4257"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1435294124,"links":["http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/14\/medethics-2014-102102.long","http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/41\/7\/570.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jme.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/04\/14\/medethics-2014-102102.full.pdf","pmid":"25881577","pubdate":"2015-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd and Institute of Medical Ethics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"medethics-2014-102102","subjects":["ethics"],"title":"How Danes evaluate moral claims related to abortion: a questionnaire survey","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/danes-evaluate-moral-claims-related-abortion-questionnaire-survey"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279668,"mean":6.2126101187845,"rank":3717775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":883025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279668,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158093,"mean":9.9197511955066,"rank":114703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158093,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1504,"mean":10.943186959415,"rank":1271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":117,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1504,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":12.0371875,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
