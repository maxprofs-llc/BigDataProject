However, the incidence of Zika and Zika-related neurological complications in Asia is not well known. The few studies of Zika in Asia have been inconsistent in pointing to likely transmission levels, with some studies suggesting substantial transmission and others not. Interpretation of existing epidemiological and public health data from Asia is constrained by the non-specific symptomatology of Zika, the high proportion of subclinical ZIKV infections, relatively low viremia, and the lack of accurate serological assays. Here, we update the status of Zika cases from countries in Asia, and highlight some key knowledge gaps. In particular, accurate determinations of the incidence of Zika-related congenital Zika syndrome should be a priority for Zika research in Asia. Additional information will be critical to make informed strategies for the prevention and control of this global public health threat.","authors":["Lim, Sl-Ki","Lim, Jacqueline Kyungah","Yoon, In-Kyu","Sl-Ki Lim","Jacqueline Kyungah Lim","In-Kyu Yoon"],"doi":"10.3947\/ic.2017.49.2.91","first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T10:02:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2093-2340","2092-6448"],"issue":"2","journal":"Infection & chemotherapy","last_mentioned_on":1501545600,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28681575?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28681575"],"pmid":"28681575","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society of Infectious Diseases and Korean Society for Chemotherapy (KAMJE)","title":"An Update on Zika Virus in Asia","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/update-zika-virus-asia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3.25,"6m":3.25,"3m":3.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
