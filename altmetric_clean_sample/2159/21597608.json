Here we show that a normal adult tissue-specific stem cell molecular phenotype is commonly activated in epithelial cancer stem cells and for the first time provide evidence that enrichment in cancer stem cells-specific molecular signatures are correlated to highly aggressive tumor phenotypes in human epithelial cancers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e17","authors":["Thomas Hussenet","Doulaye Demb\u00e9l\u00e9","Nadine Martinet","Jean-Michel Vignaud","Stanislas du Manoir"],"doi":"10.4161\/cc.9.2.10421","first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T10:58:43+00:00","issns":["1538-4101","1551-4005"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cell Cycle","last_mentioned_on":1265831292,"links":["http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/cc\/article\/10421"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.landesbioscience.com\/journals\/cc\/23HussenetCC9-2.pdf","pmid":"20023397","pubdate":"2010-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Landes Bioscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"An adult tissue-specific stem cell molecular phenotype is activated in epithelial cancer stem cells and correlated to patient outcome","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adult-tissuespecific-stem-cell-molecular-phenotype-activated-epithelial-cancer-stem-cells-correlated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.088,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.088},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8009718,"mean":6.7647711196241,"rank":1489233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6519809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8009718,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105150,"mean":10.755127637923,"rank":23827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":81323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105150,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2128,"mean":2.5148396803009,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2128,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.4184210526316,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
