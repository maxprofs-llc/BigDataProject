The phenomena are discussed as a \"selective switch\" into partly manic symptomatology or an induction of mixed states with prevailing sexual symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Greil, W","Horvath, A","Sassim, N","Erazo, N","Grohmann, R"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T11:49:36+00:00","issns":["0165-0327"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1499428162,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11223111"],"pmid":"11223111","pubdate":"2001-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Disinhibition of libido: an adverse effect of SSRI?","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disinhibition-libido-adverse-effect-ssri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":4331117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2269350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176220,"mean":11.48719695379,"rank":95616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":63312,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176220,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4269,"mean":6.1908612933458,"rank":2734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":1169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4269,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":3.9785815602837,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
