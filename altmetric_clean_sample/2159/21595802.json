The time horizon was 24 months of treatment. Cost was defined as direct medical costs (drugs, diagnostic and\/or laboratory tests, treatment of adverse effects) and indirect medical costs (productivity losses). All data are presented as euro(2005). Sensitivity analysis was 1-factor threshold, adjustment of ex-factory cost, only direct costs, and applying discount rate in the study. The results are presented as incremental costs, success rates, and cost per patient with undetectable viral load or additional success.\nThe expected 48-week cost of the regimen that includes TVD + EFV was euro46,464, and for the regimen that included COMB + EFV, euro56,198. Therefore, savings of euro9734 were achieved for each patient treated with TVD + EFV, as well as a gain of 13% of patients with undetectable viral load after 24 months of treatment. Consequently, treatment with TVD + EFV combination would be dominant in therapy for antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients. Sensitivity tests supported the stability of the base-case analysis. The cost-effectiveness ratios were euro619.52 for the TVD + EFV regimen versus euro906.41 for the COMB + EFV regimen.\nBased on the results of this analysis, patients who started treatment of HIV-1 infection with combination TVD + EFV had significantly lower health care resource utilization and overall treatment costs compared with the COMB + EFV combination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000257d","authors":["Rainel S\u00e1nchez-de la Rosa","Luis Herrera","Santiago Moreno"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinthera.2008.02.009","first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T10:12:49+00:00","issns":["01492918"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1293840000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.clinthera.2008.02.009"],"pmid":"18343275","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"Cost-effectiveness analysis of emtricitabine\/tenofovir versus lamivudine\/zidovudine, in combination with efavirenz, in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected patients","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/costeffectiveness-analysis-emtricitabinetenofovir-versus-lamivudinezidovudine-combination-efavirenz"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":2035474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4956724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148577,"mean":11.234062338467,"rank":46894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":100193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148577,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1815,"mean":3.9379547960309,"rank":324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1815,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"mean":0.82238805970149,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":135,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
