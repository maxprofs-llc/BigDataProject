This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various local anesthetic techniques in reducing pain during injection.\nA systematic review was conducted based on searches of Cochrane, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the gray literature (Google Scholar). The end search date was February 19, 2016, across all databases. We classified pain by converting visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0-100\u00a0mm) into Jensen's classification levels: 0-4, no pain; 5-44, mild pain; 45-74, moderate pain; and 75-100, severe pain. An intervention was considered clinically significant when pain score change was >12\u00a0mm on a 100-mm scale.\nEight studies out of 23 met the eligibility criteria. The total number of patients was 847. Most studies (5\/8 [62.5%]) were at unclear risk of bias because of unclear randomization, thus providing only moderate evidence to this review. The anesthetic techniques included eye drops with proparacaine, tetracaine or cocaine, a lidocaine pledget or gel, and subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine or 0.75% levobupivacaine. No study comprised all of the techniques. Pain was mild (VAS scores, 5-44\u00a0mm) regardless of anesthetic technique. A clinically significant intervention (pain score change >12\u00a0mm) was found for only one study comparing proparacaine drops, lidocaine gel, and subconjunctival lidocaine; in that study, a subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine provided the greatest pain reduction. A meta-analysis was not possible due to study heterogeneity.\nPatient pain during IVI under topical anesthesia is mild regardless of anesthetic technique. A subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine could be an option for highly sensitive patients. However, with moderate level of evidence, no single anesthetic technique could be defined as the best option for IVI.","altmetric_jid":"56b367fb2a83eea9718b4968","authors":["Helio Francisco Shiroma","Augusto Key Karazawa Takaschima","Michel Eid Farah","Ana Luisa H\u00f6fling-Lima","Graziela de Luca Canto","Roberto Henrique Benedetti","Eduardo Buchele Rodrigues"],"doi":"10.1186\/s40942-017-0076-9","first_seen_on":"2017-07-07T10:01:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2056-9920"],"journal":"International Journal of Retina and Vitreous ","last_mentioned_on":1499421696,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28680703?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC5494853","pmid":"28680703","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Patient pain during intravitreal injections under topical anesthesia: a systematic review","type":"article","volume":"3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172783,"mean":6.915960179526,"rank":7072731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172783,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176219,"mean":11.487222417687,"rank":142813,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176219,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.94558823529412,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/883264728646254592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21595161],"posted_on":"2017-07-07T10:01:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
