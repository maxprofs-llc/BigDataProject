The well-known (C6H5CH2NH3)2PbI4 phase is obtained in the form of bright orange platelets, with a structure comprised of single \u27e8100\u27e9-terminated sheets of corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra separated by bilayers of the organic cations. The presence of water during synthesis leads to formation of a novel minority phase that crystallizes in the form of nearly transparent, light yellow bar-shaped crystals. This phase adopts the monoclinic space group P21\/n and incorporates water molecules, with structural formula (C6H5CH2NH3)4Pb5I14\u00b72H2O. The crystal structure consists of ribbons of edge-sharing PbI6 octahedra separated by the organic cations. Density functional theory calculations including spin-orbit coupling show that these edge-sharing PbI6 octahedra cause the band gap to increase with respect to corner-sharing PbI6 octahedra in (C6H5CH2NH3)2PbI4. To gain systematic insight, we model the effect of the connectivity of PbI6 octahedra on the band gap in idealized lead iodide perovskite-derived compounds. We find that increasing the connectivity from corner-, via edge-, to face-sharing causes a significant increase in the band gap. This provides a new mechanism to tailor the optical properties in organic\/inorganic hybrid compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Machteld E.
