We used a correlative light and cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy method to quantify water and ion\/element contents simultaneously at a nanoscale resolution in the various compartments of cells, from the onset to the end of apoptosis. We used stably transfected HeLa cells producing H2B-GFP to identify the stages of apoptosis in cells and for a targeted elemental analysis within condensed chromatin, nucleoplasm, mitochondria and the cytosol. We found that the compartments of apoptotic cells contained, on average, 10% more water than control cells. During mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, we observed a strong increase in the Na+ and Cl- contents of the mitochondria and a strong decrease in mitochondrial K+ content. During the first step in apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), Na+ and Cl- levels decreased in all cell compartments, but remained higher than those in control cells. Conversely, during the second step of AVD, Na+ and Cl- levels increased considerably in the nucleus and mitochondria. During these two steps of AVD, K+ content decreased steadily in all cell compartments. We also determined in vivo ion status during caspase-3 activity and chromatin condensation. Finally, we found that actinomycin D-tolerant cells had water and K+ contents similar to those of cells entering apoptosis but lower Na+ and Cl- contents than both cells entering apoptosis and control cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Nolin","Jean Michel","Laurence Wortham","Pavel Tchelidze","Vincent Banchet","Nathalie Lalun","Christine Terryn","Dominique Ploton","Nolin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","Michel, Jean","Wortham, Laurence","Tchelidze, Pavel","Banchet, Vincent","Lalun, Nathalie","Terryn, Christine","Ploton, Dominique"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0148727","first_seen_on":"2016-02-11T21:28:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"2","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1455384128,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148727","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26866363?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0148727.PDF","pmid":"26866363","pubdate":"2016-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0148727","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Stage-Specific Changes in the Water, Na + , Cl - and K + Contents of Organelles during Apoptosis, Demonstrated by a Targeted Cryo Correlative Analytical Approach","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stagespecific-changes-water-na-cl-k-contents-organelles-during-apoptosis-demonstrated-targeted-cryo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7187728,"mean":6.3185455827659,"rank":5153789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1779432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7187728,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320195,"mean":9.5790874719698,"rank":203823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":98038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320195,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104199,"mean":10.063964356322,"rank":71520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":27774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104199,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5373,"mean":11.924372300819,"rank":3890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5373,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
