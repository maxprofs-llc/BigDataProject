Different classes of sequence-specific DNA-binding agents have been developed, including triplex-forming molecules, synthetic polyamides and designer zinc finger proteins. These different types of designer molecules with their different principles of engineered sequence specificity are reviewed in this paper. Furthermore, we explore and discuss the potential of these molecules as therapeutic modulators of endogenous gene function, focusing on modulation by stable gene modification and by regulation of gene transcription.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Taco G.
