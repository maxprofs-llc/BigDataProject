Despite their popularity, information about their diseases is scarce. Within skin diseases of hedgehogs, mange caused by Caparinia spp. is a common diagnosis in other countries. Two adult African hedgehogs, one male and one female, were brought to a private clinic in Heredia, Costa Rica, with chronic pruritic dermatitis, scabs, nearly complete loss of spines, lethargy, dehydration, and weight loss. During physical exam, deposits of dry seborrhea were taken and processed for diagnosis. Microscopic examination revealed psoroptid mites identified as Caparinia tripilis. This is the first report of the presence of Caparinia tripilis in Costa Rica and, to the authors' knowledge, the rest of Central America.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Moreira A","Troyo A","Calder\u00f3n-Arguedas O"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T08:48:15+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Meteorological Research","last_mentioned_on":1423016289,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24252963?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24252963","pubdate":"2013-11-22T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"First report of acariasis by Caparinia tripilis in African hedgehogs, (Atelerix albiventris), in Costa Rica.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-report-acariasis-caparinia-tripilis-african-hedgehogs-atelerix-albiventris-costa-rica"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
