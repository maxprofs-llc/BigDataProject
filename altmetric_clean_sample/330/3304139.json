In a cell, Cu-ATPases maintain the intracellular concentration of copper by transporting copper into intracellular exocytic vesicles. In addition, these P-type ATPases mediate delivery of copper to copper-dependent enzymes in the secretory pathway and in specialized cell compartments such as secretory granules or melanosomes. The multiple functions of human Cu-ATPase necessitate complex regulation of these transporters that is mediated through the presence of regulatory domains in their structure, posttranslational modification and intracellular trafficking, as well as interactions with the copper chaperone Atox1 and other regulatory molecules. In this review, we summarize the current information on the function and regulatory mechanisms acting on human Cu-ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B. Brief comparison with the Cu-ATPase orthologs from other species is included.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022ff","authors":["Lutsenko S","Gupta A","Burkhead JL","Zuzel V"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.abb.2008.05.005","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T08:30:20+00:00","issns":["0003-9861"],"issue":"1","journal":"Archives of Biochemistry & Biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1438504973,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.abb.2008.05.005","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18534184","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2556376"],"pmcid":"PMC2556376","pmid":"18534184","pubdate":"2008-06-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"CELLULAR MULTITASKING: THE DUAL ROLE OF HUMAN CU-ATPASES IN COFACTOR DELIVERY AND INTRACELLULAR COPPER BALANCE","type":"article","volume":"476","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-multitasking-dual-role-human-cuatpases-cofactor-delivery-intracellular-copper-balance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5436183,"mean":6.3250884403785,"rank":1373423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3441543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5436183,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188112,"mean":8.7143837202504,"rank":55983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":129442,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188112,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1685,"mean":2.9220047505938,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1685,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.8578918918919,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
