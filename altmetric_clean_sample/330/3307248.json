All the 6400-ppm-exposed males and females died during the first week. Terminal body weight decreased, and relative weights of liver, kidney, and lung increased. AST increased in the 200 ppm-and 3200-ppm-exposed females, and ALT increased in the 3200-ppm-exposed males and females. Nuclear enlargement of nasal respiratory epithelial cells occurring in the 100-ppm-exposed males and females was the most sensitive, followed by the enlarged nuclei in the olfactory, tracheal, and bronchial epithelia. 1,4-Dioxane-induced liver lesions occurred at higher exposure concentrations than the nasal lesions did, and were characterized by single-cell necrosis and centrilobular swelling of hepatocytes in males and females. Glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive liver foci were observed in the 1600-ppm-exposed females and 3200-ppm-exposed males and females, which are known as a preneoplastic lesion in rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Plasma levels of 1,4-dioxane increased linearly with an increase in the concentrations of exposure to 400 ppm and above. The enlarged nuclei in the nasal epithelia and the GST-P-positive liver foci were discussed in light of the possible development of nasal and hepatic tumors by long-term inhalation exposure to 1,4-dioxane. A lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) was determined at 100 ppm for the nasal endpoint in both male and female rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5273cf058f610003db6","authors":["Tatsuya Kasai","Kasai T","Saito M","Senoh H","Umeda Y","Aiso S","Ohbayashi H","Nishizawa T","Nagano K","Fukushima S"],"doi":"10.1080\/08958370802105397","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T09:32:54+00:00","issns":["0895-8378"],"issue":"10","journal":"Inhalation Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/08958370802105397","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18668411"],"pmid":"18668411","pubdate":"2008-08-01T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Thirteen-week inhalation toxicity of 1,4-dioxane in rats.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/thirteenweek-inhalation-toxicity-14dioxane-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7627836,"mean":6.5633335207133,"rank":1850653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4761439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7627836,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235873,"mean":8.06650657984,"rank":66306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":164963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235873,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":4.1148413547237,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.55,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
