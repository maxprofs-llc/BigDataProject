Failure of the interactions between the 2 cell types, as seen in numerous genetic mouse models, results in severe and often lethal cardiovascular defects. Abnormal interactions between the 2 cell types are also implicated in a number of human pathological conditions, including tumor angiogenesis, diabetic microangiopathy, ectopic tissue calcification, and stroke and dementia syndrome CADASIL. In the present review, we summarize current knowledge concerning the identity, characteristics, diversity, ontogeny, and plasticity of pericytes. We focus on the advancement in recent years of the understanding of intercellular communication between endothelial and mural cells with a focus on transforming growth factor beta, angiopoietins, platelet-derived growth factor, spingosine-1-phosphate, and Notch ligands and their respective receptors. We finally highlight recent important data contributing to the understanding of the role of pericytes in tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, and hereditary lymphedema.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ec9","authors":["Annika Armulik","Alexandra Abramsson","Christer Betsholtz"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.res.0000182903.16652.d7","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T10:23:54+00:00","issns":["1524-4571"],"journal":"Circulation Research (Highwire)","last_mentioned_on":1320228379,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1161\/01.RES.0000182903.16652.d7","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16166562"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circres.ahajournals.org\/content\/97\/6\/512.full.pdf","pmid":"16166562","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Endothelial\/pericyte interactions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endothelialpericyte-interactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":816231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94198,"mean":8.0944411393146,"rank":24418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94198,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1785,"mean":2.7306905829596,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1785,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.5204545454545,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":31,"Researcher":123,"Student  > Doctoral Student":34,"Student  > Ph.
