These are achieved through a series of light-induced multi-electron-transfer reactions involving chlorophylls in a special arrangement and several other species including specific enzymes. Artificial photosynthesis attempts to reconstruct these key processes in simpler model systems such that solar energy and abundant natural resources can be used to generate high energy fuels and restrict the amount of CO(2) in the atmosphere. Details of few model catalytic systems that lead to clean oxidation of water to H(2) and O(2), photoelectrochemical solar cells for the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity, solar cells for total decomposition of water and catalytic systems for fixation of CO(2) to fuels such as methanol and methane are reviewed here.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269f","doi":"10.1016\/j.copbio.2010.03.021","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T08:59:11+00:00","issns":["09581669"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1327593396,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0958166910000649","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.copbio.2010.03.021","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20439158"],"pmid":"20439158","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Artificial photosynthesis: biomimetic approaches to solar energy conversion and storage.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artificial-photosynthesis-biomimetic-approaches-solar-energy-conversion-storage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":817848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93561,"mean":8.007763766567,"rank":24153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93561,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":2.3798823529412,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.609375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":65,"Student  > Doctoral Student":13,"Student  > Ph.
