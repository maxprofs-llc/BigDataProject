We describe the results of a clinical study characterising an A\/H1N1 influenza challenge virus in humans.MethodsThe challenge agent, influenza A\/California\/2009 (H1N1), was manufactured under cGMP conditions and characterised in accordance with regulatory guidelines. A dose-ascending open-label clinical study was conducted in 29 healthy young adults screened sero-negative to the challenge strain. Subjects were intranasally inoculated with three increasing doses of virus and physician-reported signs, subjected-reported symptoms, viral shedding and immunological responses were monitored.ResultsA dose-dependent increase in clinical signs and symptoms was observed with 75% of subjects developing laboratory-confirmed illness at the highest inoculum (3.5 x 106 TCID50). At the highest dose, physician or subject-reported signs of infection were classified as mild (all subjects), moderate (50%) and severe (16%) with peak symptoms recorded four days after infection. Clinical signs were correlated with nasal mucus weight (P\u00bf<\u00bf.001) and subject-reported symptoms (P\u00bf<\u00bf.001). Geometric mean peak viral shedding was log10 5.16 TCID50 and occurred three days after inoculation with a median duration of five days. The safety profile was such that physiological responses to viral infection were mainly restricted to the upper airways but were not of such severity to be of clinical concern.ConclusionsA highly characterised wild-type Influenza A\/California\/2009 (H1N1) virus manufactured for clinical use was shown to induce a good infectivity profile in human volunteers. This clinical challenge model can be used for evaluating potential efficacy of vaccines and anti-viral therapeutics.Trial registration NCT02014870.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a9","authors":["Jeannette M Watson","James N Francis","Sofie Mesens","Gabriel A Faiman","Jill Makin","Peter Patriarca","John J Treanor","Bertrand Georges","Campbell J Bunce"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12985-015-0240-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T09:51:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-422X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Virology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1423585090,"links":["http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/12\/1\/13\/abstract","http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/12\/1\/13","http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/12\/1\/13?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/pdf\/s12985-015-0240-5.pdf","pmid":"25645025","pubdate":"2015-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"13","title":"Characterisation of a wild-type influenza (A\/H1N1) virus strain as an experimental challenge agent in humans","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterisation-wildtype-influenza-ah1n1-virus-strain-experimental-challenge-agent-humans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":1874159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3146256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178856,"mean":8.6402818372424,"rank":56529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":121295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178856,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1363,"mean":3.345966226138,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1363,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":4.0517692307692,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
