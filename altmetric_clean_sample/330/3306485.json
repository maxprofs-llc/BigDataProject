The study of this fascinating form of chromosome-wide gene regulation has yielded surprising insights into early development and cellular memory. In the past few months, three papers reported unexpected findings about the paternal X chromosome (X(p)). All three studies agree that the X(p) is imprinted to become inactive earlier than ever suspected during embryonic development. Although apparently incomplete, this early form of inactivation insures dosage compensation throughout development. Silencing of the X(p) persists in cells of extraembryonic tissues, but it is erased and followed by random X inactivation in cells of the embryo proper. These findings challenge several aspects of the current view of X inactivation during early development and may have profound impact on studies of pluripotency and epigenetics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023cb","authors":["Cheng MK","Disteche CM"],"doi":"10.1002\/bies.20082","endpage":"824","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T09:16:43+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-1878","0265-9247"],"issue":"8","journal":"BioEssays","last_mentioned_on":1189447969,"links":["http:\/\/www3.interscience.wiley.com\/cgi-bin\/fulltext\/109565168\/PDFSTART","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/bies.20082","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15273983"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/bies.20082\/pdf","pmid":"15273983","pubdate":"2004-08-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"821","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biology"],"title":"Silence of the fathers: early X inactivation.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silence-fathers-early-x-inactivation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616025,"mean":4.9319901986302,"rank":815329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2276966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616025,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92083,"mean":7.108510262592,"rank":23307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92083,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":963,"mean":4.867422037422,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":963,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.2416666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
