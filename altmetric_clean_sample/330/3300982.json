Characteristics of babbling and first words in 12 Italian children with slow expressive development (late talkers; LT) were compared with those of 12 typically developing (TD) peers. Syllable structure and phonetic characteristics of babbling and first words produced by both groups of children at 20 months were analysed during mother-child play sessions. Results indicated that phonetic complexity and number of consonantal types were lower in the LT group. The two groups also differed in their use of sound classes and their syllable structure. Overall, it can be said that LTs development is similar to (but slower than) TDs, as opposed to having an atypical pattern of phonological development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002562","authors":["Mirco Fasolo"],"doi":"10.1080\/02699200701600015","first_seen_on":"2015-02-04T07:06:26+00:00","issns":["0269-9206"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Linguistics & Phonetics","last_mentioned_on":1334036716,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/02699200701600015"],"pmid":"17896213","pubdate":"2007-09-26T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Babbling and first words in children with slow expressive development.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/babbling-first-words-children-slow-expressive-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":817374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93818,"mean":8.0464605775074,"rank":24260,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93818,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":1.8950470588235,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
