Experimental pentane elimination capacity (EC) of approximately 12 g m(-3) h(-1) was obtained for an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 1.1 h and inlet concentration of 18.6 g m(-3). For these experimental conditions, EC of MTBE between 0.3 and 1.8 g m(-3) h(-1) were measured with inlet MTBE concentration ranging from 1.1 to 12.3 g m(-3). The process was modeled with general mass balance equations that consider a kinetic model describing cross-competitive inhibition between MTBE (cosubstrate) and pentane (substrate). The experimental data of pentane and MTBE removal efficiencies were compared to the theoretical predictions of the model. The predicted pentane and MTBE concentration profiles agreed with the experimental data for steady-state operation. Inhibition by MTBE of the pentane EC was demonstrated. Increasing the inlet pentane concentration improved the EC of MTBE but did not significantly change the EC of pentane. MTBE degradation rates obtained in this study were much lower than those using consortia or pure strains that can mineralize MTBE. Nevertheless, the system can be improved by increasing the active biomass.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027ef","authors":["Dupasquier, David","Revah, Sergio","Auria, Richard"],"first_seen_on":"2012-11-03T16:00:46+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0013-936X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Environmental Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1351935091,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11827059"],"pmid":"11827059","pubdate":"2002-01-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Biofiltration of methyl tert-butyl ether vapors by cometabolism with pentane: modeling and experimental approach.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biofiltration-methyl-tertbutyl-ether-vapors-cometabolism-pentane-modeling-experimental-approach"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635050,"mean":4.9227315329755,"rank":2900917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":78376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635050,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78720,"mean":5.1479511172652,"rank":58685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78720,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3911,"mean":7.8215856777494,"rank":3317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3911,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":5.6444525547445,"rank":106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Associate Professor":1,"Post Doc":1,"Ph.D. Student":1,"Other Professional":1,"Lecturer":1,"Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":3,"Engineering":1,"Environmental Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Biofiltration of methyl tert-butyl ether...
