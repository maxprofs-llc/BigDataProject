So far, the number of polymorphisms in SLC22A1, SLC22A2, and SLC47A1 genes coding for organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), OCT2, and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) metformin transporters have been described in association with the efficacy of metformin. However, there is no information on the influence of genetic variations within these genes on the side effects of metformin. In this study, we assessed whether five single-nucleotide polymorphisms and two indel polymorphisms are associated with the side effects of metformin in patients with T2D.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100084d9","doi":"10.1097\/fpc.0b013e3283561666","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T04:36:16+00:00","issns":["1744-6872"],"issue":"9","journal":"Pharmacogenetics and Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1351830971,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/Abstract\/2012\/09000\/Association_of_genetic_variation_in_the_organic.2.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jpharmacogenetics\/2012\/09000\/Association_of_genetic_variation_in_the_organic.2.pdf","pmid":"22735389","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"659","subjects":["geneticsmedical","pharmacology"],"title":"Association of genetic variation in the organic cation transporters OCT1, OCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 transporter protein genes with the gastrointestinal side effects and lower BMI in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-genetic-variation-organic-cation-transporters-oct1-oct2-multidrug-toxin-extrusion-1-tran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":965016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82416,"mean":5.4216129830735,"rank":53980,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82416,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":523,"mean":1.545398467433,"rank":343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":523,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":0.94791666666667,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
