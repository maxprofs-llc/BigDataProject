We show that the classical experimental environment fits within a parameter regime which is qualitatively distinct from conditions one expects to find in living cells. Through an asymptotic analysis of our system of SDEs, we develop a means for applying in vitro observations of the nonlinear response by motors to forces induced on the attached cargo to make analytical predictions for two parameter regimes that have thus far eluded direct experimental observation: (1) highly viscous in vivo transport and (2) dynamics when multiple identical motors are attached to the cargo and microtubule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["McKinley SA","Athreya A","Fricks J","Kramer PR"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2012.03.035","first_seen_on":"2012-11-01T17:01:24+00:00","issns":["0022-5193","00225193"],"journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1351789277,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022519312001671"],"pmid":"22575549","pubdate":"2012-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Asymptotic analysis of microtubule-based transport by multiple identical molecular motors ","type":"article","volume":"305C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/asymptotic-analysis-microtubulebased-transport-multiple-identical-molecular-motors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7388480,"mean":6.4192165805667,"rank":6393582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7388480,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104161,"mean":5.6488786290323,"rank":84044,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104161,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1939,"mean":3.60073374613,"rank":1741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1939,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.6838235294118,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
