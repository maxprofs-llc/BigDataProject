Among others, genetic factors can influence the outcome of critically ill patients. HLA-G is a non-classical class Ib molecule that has limited protein variability, presenting seven isoforms generated by alternative splicing, and presents immunomodulatory properties. Polymorphisms at the 3'UTR are thought to influence HLA-G gene expression. It was previously observed that increased sHLA-G5 levels were predictive of survival among septic shock patients. We assessed the frequencies of 7 polymorphisms in exon 8 at the 3' UTR of HLA-G and associated these variants with different clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: Exon 8 at the 3' UTR of the HLA-G gene from 638 critically ill subjects was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Genotypes were identified using FinchTV software v.1.4.0 and the most probable haplotype constitution of each sample was determined by PHASE software v.2.1. Haplotype frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, heterozygosity test and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium were estimated using ARLEQUIN software v.3.5. RESULTS: Among all critically ill patients, an association between carriers of the +2960IN_+3142 G_+3187A haplotype and septic shock (P = 0.047) was observed. Septic patients who carried the +2960IN_+3142G_+3187A haplotype presented an increased risk for septic shock (P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed, for the first time, an association between polymorphisms in exon 8 at the 3 'UTR of HLA-G gene and outcomes of critically ill patients. These results may be important for understanding the mechanisms involved in evolution to septic shock in critically ill patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000805","doi":"10.1186\/cc11845","first_seen_on":"2012-10-30T09:25:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1354094449,"links":["http:\/\/ccforum.com\/content\/16\/5\/R211\/abstract"],"pmid":"23107167","pubdate":"2012-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"R211","title":"Polymorphic variants in exon 8 at the 3' UTR of the HLA-G gene are associated with septic shock in critically ill patients","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polymorphic-variants-exon-8-3-utr-hlag-gene-associated-septic-shock-critically-ill-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4786552,"mean":5.7300452919041,"rank":829501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3952629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4786552,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83888,"mean":5.6983826099396,"rank":14450,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":69345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83888,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2618,"mean":6.6471501719526,"rank":770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":1842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2618,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138,"mean":4.0682481751825,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
