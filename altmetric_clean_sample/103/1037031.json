There were multiple well-defined echogenic nodular lesions within the spleen parenchyma, and these lesions were surrounded by ring-like blood flow on color Doppler imaging. Most of the patients with Niemann-Pick disease type B are children and they undergo repeated imaging studies. Therefore, familiarity with sonographic findings of the disease is required.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bf3","authors":["Adin, Mehmet Emin","\u00d6nder, Hakan","Alabal\u0131k, Ula\u015f"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcu.22009","endpage":"34","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T10:45:45+00:00","issns":["1097-0096","0091-2751"],"issue":"S1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Ultrasound","last_mentioned_on":1351853140,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcu.22009\/abstract;jsessionid=CD5E1824970BCEF2EF85FC47F5A9451E.d02t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcu.22009\/pdf","pmid":"23124800","pubdate":"2012-11-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"32","subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Echogenic splenic lesions in a child with type B NiemannPick disease","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/echogenic-splenic-lesions-child-type-b-niemannpick-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6326345,"mean":5.9762354083184,"rank":4675493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":942741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6326345,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90765,"mean":5.8224727645322,"rank":59544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90765,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":294,"mean":2.291433447099,"rank":214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":294,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.94285714285714,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UltrasoundSuply\/statuses\/264317345604976640","license":"public","citation_ids":[1037031],"posted_on":"2012-11-02T10:45:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Smart Ultrasound","url":"http:\/\/www.drsmart.com","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_2_normal.png","description":"same day shipping on ultrasound gel, paper, biopsy needles and surgical headlights.
