Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is part of the biofilm matrix and serves as a structural component. Human \u03b2-defensin-3 (hBD-3) is a cationic antimicrobial host defense protein (AMP) critical to the protection of the middle ear. We hypothesized that anionic eDNA could interact with and bind hBD-3 and thus shield NTHI in biofilms from its antimicrobial activity. We demonstrated that recombinant hBD-3 [(r)hBD-3] bound eDNA in vitro and that eDNA in biofilms produced by NTHI in the chinchilla middle ear co-localized with the orthologue of this AMP. Incubation of physiological concentrations of (r)hBD-3 with NTHI genomic DNA abrogated the ability of this innate immune effector to prevent NTHI from forming robust biofilms in vitro. Establishment of NTHI biofilms in the presence of both DNase I and (r)hBD-3 resulted in a marked reduction in the overall height and thickness of the biofilms and rescued the antimicrobial activity of the AMP. Our results demonstrated that eDNA in NTHI biofilms sequestered hBD-3 and thus diminished the biological activity of an important effector of innate immunity. Our observations have important implications for chronicity of NTHI-induced diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cdb","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T21:14:48+00:00","issns":["1662-811X"],"journal":"Journal of Innate Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1351897180,"links":["http:\/\/content.Karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/Produkte.asp?doi=000339961&ref=tw"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.Karger.com\/ProdukteDB\/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF\r\n\t\t\tdocument.images[button].src = oldSrc.substring(0, oldSrc.length - 5) + state + ","pmid":"22922323","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Karger Publishers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Extracellular DNA within a Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae-Induced Biofilm Binds Human Beta Defensin-3 and Reduces Its Antimicrobial Activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extracellular-dna-within-nontypeable-haemophilus-influenzaeinduced-biofilm-binds-human-beta-defensin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4786970,"mean":2.9800711631003e+18,"rank":4226977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4786970,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74188,"mean":3.1052811851236e+18,"rank":65007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74188,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":3.509826197194e+18,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":10,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
