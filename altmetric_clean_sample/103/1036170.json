While associative learning - the ability to detect correlated features of the environment - has been studied extensively in nervous systems, where the underlying mechanisms are reasonably well understood, mechanisms within single cells that could allow associative learning have received little attention. Here, using in silico evolution of chemical networks, we show that there exists a diversity of remarkably simple and plausible chemical solutions to the associative learning problem, the simplest of which uses only one core chemical reaction. We then asked to what extent a linear combination of chemical concentrations in the network could approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior of an environment given the stimulus history so far? This Bayesian analysis revealed the 'memory traces' of the chemical network. The implication of this paper is that there is little reason to believe that a lack of suitable phenotypic variation would prevent associative learning from evolving in cell signalling, metabolic, gene regulatory, or a mixture of these networks in cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003349","authors":["Simon McGregor","Vera Vasas","Phil Husbands","Chrisantha Fernando"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002739","first_seen_on":"2012-11-01T23:14:58+00:00","issns":["1553-7358"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","last_mentioned_on":1354511272,"links":["http:\/\/www.ploscompbiol.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002739","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002739"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1002739.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3486861","pmid":"23133353","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Mathematics","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"e1002739","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Evolution of Associative Learning in Chemical Networks","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-associative-learning-chemical-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":695350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4031779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83328,"mean":5.7436886483373,"rank":12830,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":70456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83328,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3014,"mean":13.104159309658,"rank":1039,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3014,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":8.7327956989247,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":75,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
