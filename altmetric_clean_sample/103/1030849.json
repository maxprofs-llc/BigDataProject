The present study was designed to examine whether this impaired acquisition was attributable to a lack of automatization, and whether the reported preserved consolidation was attributable to the use of DDs' conscious compensation strategies. These aims were implemented by testing a skill-learning task in dyslexics and normal readers using a dual task paradigm. The impact of dual task costs on participants' performance was used as an indication for automaticity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f61000983f","authors":["Gabay Y","Schiff R","Vakil E"],"doi":"10.1037\/a0030235","endpage":"757","first_seen_on":"2012-10-30T12:36:22+00:00","issns":["0894-4105 (Print)","0894-4105","1931-1559"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuropsychology","last_mentioned_on":1473804298,"links":["http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/neu\/26\/6\/744?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+apa-journals-neu+(Neuropsychology)","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/a0030235"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/journals\/neu\/26\/6\/744.pdf","pmid":"23106118","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"744","subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Attentional requirements during acquisition and consolidation of a skill in normal readers and developmental dyslexics.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attentional-requirements-during-acquisition-consolidation-skill-normal-readers-developmental-dyslexi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":4222841,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3934499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":108378,"mean":5.9283865026713,"rank":50146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":55074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":108378,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1443,"mean":3.2182746185853,"rank":404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":999,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1443,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.3214285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
