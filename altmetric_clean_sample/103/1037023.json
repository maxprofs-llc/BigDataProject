The isolates were identified as C. mycophilum from Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus eryngii, C. varium from Flammulina velutipes and Hypsizygus marmoreus. The cultural characteristics of the four isolates were investigated using potato dextrose agar (PDA) media under nine different temperatures ranging from 5~32\u2103. Rapid growth of the isolates to colony diameters of 47~82 mm was observed at conditions of 18~22\u2103. No growth was observed at 32\u2103. C. mycophilum produced a yellowish red pigment while C. varium produced a cream colored pigment after cultivation for 25 days on PDA. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region and partial 28S rDNA from the four isolates confirmed they were C. mycophilum and C. varium. Cross pathogenicity tests revealed that the two isolates of C. mycophilum were highly pathogenic toward three mushroom types, but not toward H. marmoreus. The two isolates of C. varium were less pathogenic than those of C. mycophilum, but were pathogenic toward all mushroom types evaluated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000424c","doi":"10.5941\/myco.2012.40.3.189","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T10:41:46+00:00","issns":["2092-9323"],"issue":"3","journal":"Mycobiology","last_mentioned_on":1351852900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23115512?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23115512","pubdate":"2012-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Characterization of Species of Cladobotryum which Cause Cobweb Disease in Edible Mushrooms Grown in Korea.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-species-cladobotryum-cause-cobweb-disease-edible-mushrooms-grown-korea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82416,"mean":5.428143032215,"rank":53905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82416,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":1.2192857142857,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
