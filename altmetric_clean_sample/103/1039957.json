Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) are autoimmune demyelinating disorders of Central and Peripheral Nervous system, respectively. The coexistence of these two syndromes in an individual's life span is rare. Objectives. To inspect throughout Isfahan MS society (IMSS) records for MS cases who had history of documented GBS whether before the onset of MS or after it. Methods. This retrospective survey was carried out by analyzing the clinical records of 3,522 MS patients who were registered with IMSS, from April 2003 to July 2010. Eligible cases were requested to attend to IMSS for final clinical\/paraclinical examinations. Results. Among 3,522 (2,716 women and 806 men) MS subjects, we could identify seven patients (six females and one male) with documented diagnosis of GBS. Six patients (five women and one man) had developed MS within 6.5 \u00b1 7.0 (range: 1-16) years after being diagnosed with GBS and one (a woman) had developed GBS three years after the diagnosis of MS. Conclusion. It seems that the development of MS in individuals with history of GBS is more than a simple incidental event.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51e3cf058f610003990","authors":["Akbari, Mojtaba"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/232139","first_seen_on":"2012-11-04T12:44:40+00:00","issns":["2090-0422"],"journal":"Autoimmune Diseases (2090-0422)","last_mentioned_on":1361680862,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ad\/2012\/232139\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ad\/2012\/232139.pdf","pmid":"23198139","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Linkage of Multiple Sclerosis and Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Population-Based Survey in Isfahan, Iran","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/linkage-multiple-sclerosis-guillainbarre-syndrome-populationbased-survey-isfahan-iran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":2694641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":894094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78426,"mean":5.1514579024546,"rank":51429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":25265,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78426,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.5089512195122,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
