We investigated associations between offspring birth weight and paternal and maternal cardiovascular mortality and offspring birth weight and cardiovascular mortality among all four grandparents, and further assessed the mediating role of maternal smoking during pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007331","authors":["George Davey Smith"],"doi":"10.1093\/eurheartj\/ehs298","first_seen_on":"2012-10-30T03:11:36+00:00","funders":["mrc"],"issns":["1522-9645"],"journal":"European Heart Journal","last_mentioned_on":1351704353,"links":["http:\/\/eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/29\/eurheartj.ehs298.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/29\/eurheartj.ehs298.full.pdf","pmid":"22977224","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Cardiovascular mortality in relation to birth weight of children and grandchildren in 500 000 Norwegian families","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiovascular-mortality-relation-birth-weight-children-grandchildren-500-000-norwegian-families"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2318536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85434,"mean":5.7472501960601,"rank":33713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":48962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85434,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2703,"mean":9.1059496669134,"rank":1484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2703,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.896347826087,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
