BACE1 is an attractive therapeutic target for AD treatment, but it exhibits other physiological activities and has many other substrates besides APP. Thus, inhibition of BACE1 function may cause adverse side effects. Here, we present a peptide, S1, isolated from a peptide library that selectively inhibits BACE1 hydrolytic activity by binding to the \u03b2-proteolytic site on APP and A\u03b2 N-terminal. The S1 peptide significantly reduced A\u03b2 levels in vitro and in vivo and inhibited A\u03b2 cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. When applied to APPswe\/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice by intracerebroventricular injection, S1 significantly improved the spatial memory as determined by the Morris Water Maze, and also attenuated their A\u03b2 burden. These results indicate that the dual-functional peptide S1 may have therapeutic potential for AD by both reducing A\u03b2 generation and inhibiting A\u03b2 cytotoxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Shi-gao Yang","Shao-wei Wang","Min Zhao","Ran Zhang","Wei-wei Zhou","Ya-nan Li","Ya-jing Su","He Zhang","Xiao-lin Yu","Rui-tian Liu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0048540","first_seen_on":"2012-11-01T22:07:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1352373092,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0048540"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0048540.pdf","pmid":"23133641","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e48540","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A Peptide Binding to the \u03b2-Site of APP Improves Spatial Memory and Attenuates A\u03b2 Burden in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Transgenic Mice","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peptide-binding-%CE%B2site-app-improves-spatial-memory-attenuates-a%CE%B2-burden-alzheimers-disease-transgenic-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1785875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2639641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82513,"mean":5.4911226730658,"rank":27487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":53447,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82513,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":29954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":48037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4198,"mean":6.5159366213962,"rank":1386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4198,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"EG":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/librarian123456\/statuses\/266498180567420928","license":"public","citation_ids":[1036078],"posted_on":"2012-11-08T11:11:32+00:00","author":{"name":"urmyuniverse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"librarian123456","tweeter_id":"285939976","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"266498180567420928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aghoury79\/statuses\/264126596284293120","license":"public","citation_ids":[1036078],"posted_on":"2012-11-01T22:07:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Ahmed Elaghoury","url":"http:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/aghoury","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/749706574990573568\/1hdbWkTG_normal.jpg","description":"Physician specialized & blogging in psychiatry, sleep medicine & related neurology.","id_on_source":"aghoury79","tweeter_id":"55548061","geo":{"lt":31.21564,"ln":29.95527,"country":"EG"},"followers":2030},"tweet_id":"264126596284293120"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NatRevNeurol\/statuses\/264311566411894784","license":"public","citation_ids":[1036078],"posted_on":"2012-11-02T10:22:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Nat Rev Neurology","url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nrneurol\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1629167444\/nrneurol_Twitter_logo_normal.jpg","description":"Nature Reviews Neurology is a clinical review journal from Nature Publishing Group.
