Some studies have suggested the coarse fraction, particles between 2.5 and 10 microm (PM(10-2.5)), may also be important. With respect to mortality and cardiovascular events, questions remain regarding the relative strength of effect sizes for chronic exposure to fine and coarse particles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027e9","authors":["Puett RC","Hart JE","Yanosky JD","Paciorek C","Schwartz J","Suh H","Speizer FE","Laden F"],"doi":"10.1289\/ehp.0900572","endpage":"1701","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T15:56:57+00:00","issns":["0091-6765"],"issue":"11","journal":"Environmental Health Perspectives","last_mentioned_on":1351861920,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20049120"],"pmcid":"PMC2801178","pmid":"20049120","pubdate":"2010-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1697","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Chronic fine and coarse particulate exposure, mortality, and coronary heart disease in the Nurses' Health Study.","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chronic-fine-coarse-particulate-exposure-mortality-coronary-heart-disease-nurses-health-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.888,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.888},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":410814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3274914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78968,"mean":5.1385861182519,"rank":9256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":69711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78968,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2273,"mean":7.8762623239437,"rank":500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1771,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2273,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":7.0725,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
