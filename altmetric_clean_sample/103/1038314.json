The rate of aging in these rats seems inversely related to both their early growth rates and the accessibility of brain tryptophan. The subsequent age retardation may depend on a reduction in both early cell loss and rate of brain maturation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5973cf058f6100050b3","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T22:43:28+00:00","issns":["0047-6374"],"issue":"3-4","journal":"Mechanisms of Ageing & Development","last_mentioned_on":1351895694,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6656308"],"pmid":"6656308","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Low tryptophan diets delay reproductive aging.","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/low-tryptophan-diets-delay-reproductive-aging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78725,"mean":5.1707500635131,"rank":58853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78725,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278,"mean":3.7825703971119,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
