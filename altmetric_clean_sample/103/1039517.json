Measurement methods are proposed for in situ exposure assessment of these ATC systems. In total, 50 sites are investigated at 1,073 locations in the frequency range of 255 kHz to 24 GHz. For all installations, typical and maximal exposure values for workers and the general public are provided. Two of the 14 types of systems, Non-Directional Beacons (NDB) (up to 881.6 V m) and Doppler Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-directional Range (DVOR) (up to 92.3 V m), exhibited levels requiring recommended minimum distances such that the ICNIRP reference levels are not exceeded. Cumulative exposure of all present radiofrequency (RF) sources is investigated, and it is concluded that the ATC source dominates the total exposure in its neighborhood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f6100065f3","authors":["Joseph W","Goeminne F","Vermeeren G","Verloock L","Martens L","Wout Joseph","Francis Goeminne","G\u00fcnter Vermeeren","Leen Verloock","Luc Martens"],"doi":"10.1097\/hp.0b013e31825f78d5","endpage":"762","first_seen_on":"2012-11-03T22:07:25+00:00","handle":"1854\/LU-4229367","handles":["1854\/LU-4229367"],"issns":["0017-9078"],"issue":"6","journal":"Health Physics","last_mentioned_on":1352005324,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23111522","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1097\/HP.0b013e31825f78d5"],"pmid":"23111522","pubdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"750","subjects":["environmentalhealth","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Occupational and public field exposure from communication, navigation, and radar systems used for air traffic control.","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/occupational-public-field-exposure-communication-navigation-radar-systems-used-air-traffic-control"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082727,"mean":6.8629605662661,"rank":3333388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4705683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082727,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107640,"mean":5.8528553405365,"rank":38034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":68933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107640,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1619,"mean":4.407065512979,"rank":1408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1619,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.3727272727273,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
