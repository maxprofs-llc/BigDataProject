Here, transcriptome profiling and differentiation assay revealed a requirement of PARG for retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcription. Mechanistically, PARG accumulates early at promoters of RAR-responsive genes upon retinoic acid treatment to promote the formation of an appropriate chromatin environment suitable for transcription. Silencing of PARG or knockout of its enzymatic activity maintains the H3K9me2 mark at the promoter of the RAR-dependent genes, leading to the absence of preinitiation complex formation. In the absence of PARG, we found that the H3K9 demethylase KDM4D\/JMJD2D became PARsylated. Mutation of two glutamic acids located in the Jumonji N domain of KDM4D inhibited PARsylation. PARG becomes dispensable for ligand-dependent transcription when either a PARP inhibitor or a non-PARsylable KDM4D\/JMJD2D mutant is used. Our results define PARG as a coactivator regulating chromatin remodeling during RA-dependent gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Nicolas Le\u00a0May","Izarn Iltis","Jean-Christophe Am\u00e9","Alexander Zhovmer","Denis Biard","Jean-Marc Egly","Val\u00e9rie Schreiber","Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Coin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2012.09.021","first_seen_on":"2012-10-30T15:21:09+00:00","issns":["10972765"],"journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1351610451,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1097276512008210"],"pmid":"23102699","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Poly (ADP-Ribose) Glycohydrolase Regulates Retinoic Acid Receptor-Mediated Gene Expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/poly-adpribose-glycohydrolase-regulates-retinoic-acid-receptormediated-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82373,"mean":5.4419933229738,"rank":53853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82373,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3351,"mean":4.4717826865672,"rank":2760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3351,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.0535675675676,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
