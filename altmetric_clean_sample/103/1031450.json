Most cancers are believed to be initiated from and maintained by a small population of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC) that are responsible for tumor relapse and chemotherapeutic resistance. Although epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, has been reported to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in some cancer cells, its effect on CSC is undefined. In this study, we enriched CSC by the sphere formation, and provided an efficient model for further experiments. Using this method, we examined the effects of EGCG regulating the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) CSC and attempted to elucidate the possible mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b0","authors":["Chien-Hung Lin","Chien-Hung Lin","Yao-An Shen","Peir-Haur Hung","Yuan-Bin Yu","Yann-Jang Chen"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6882-12-201","first_seen_on":"2012-10-30T17:02:23+00:00","issns":["","1472-6882"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1351647655,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6882\/12\/201\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6882-12-201.pdf"],"pmid":"23110507","pubdate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"201","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Epigallocathechin gallate, polyphenol present in green tea, inhibits stem-like characteristics and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigallocathechin-gallate-polyphenol-present-green-tea-inhibits-stemlike-characteristics-epithelialm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1786106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2639247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82375,"mean":5.4707549955083,"rank":27394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":53398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82375,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1452,"mean":4.8322343211578,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1452,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":7.1488860759494,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
