ROS also help to monitor different cell fates, suggesting that a 'ROS rheostat' exists in cells. It is well established that ROS are crucial for stem cell biology; in this review, we discuss how mitochondrial ROS influence hematopoietic cell fates. We also examine the importance in this process of BID and other BCL-2 family members, many of which have been implicated in regulating cell fates by modulating mitochondrial integrity\/activity and cell cycle progression in the hematopoietic lineage. Based on this knowledge, we propose that selected BCL-2 proteins coordinate mitochondria and nuclear activities via ROS to enable 'synchronized' cell fate decisions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036a7","authors":["Atan Gross"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tcb.2012.09.007","first_seen_on":"2012-10-31T08:58:46+00:00","issns":["0962-8924"],"journal":"Trends in Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1375871531,"links":["http:\/\/www.cell.com\/trends\/cell-biology\/abstract\/S0962-8924(12)00178-X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/download.cell.com\/trends\/cell-biology\/pdf\/PIIS096289241200178X.pdf","pmid":"23117019","pubdate":"2012-10-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"A ROS rheostat for cell fate regulation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ros-rheostat-cell-fate-regulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":1726695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1835907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79142,"mean":5.1882803603695,"rank":29963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":47122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79142,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":551,"mean":3.03892,"rank":341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":551,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":2.98824,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
