The normal and pathological growth of the prostate are both dependent on stimulation by dihydrotestosterone, which is synthesized from circulating testosterone by two 5\u03b1-reductase (5\u03b1-R) isozymes, 5\u03b1-reductase type 1 (5\u03b1-R1) and 5\u03b1-reductase type 2 (5\u03b1-R2). Both isozymes have been implicated in prostate disease. We used quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, to quantify mRNA and protein levels of 5\u03b1-R isozymes in the ventral prostate of adult rats under environmental stress conditions analogous to those found in some common workplace situations, i.e. artificial light, excessive heat, and the sensation of immobility in a small space. Transcription and expression levels of both 5\u03b1-R isozymes were significantly higher in environmentally stressed rats than in unstressed rats. Increased 5\u03b1-R isozyme levels may play a role in the development or maintenance of prostate disease. Further research is warranted to explore these effects of environmental stress on human health and their implications for environmental and occupational health policies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b6","authors":["S\u00e1nchez, Pilar","Torres, Jes\u00fas M.","Castro, Beatriz","Olmo, Asunci\u00f3n","del Moral, Raimundo G.","Ortega, Esperanza"],"doi":"10.1111\/febs.12052","endpage":"101","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T09:23:50+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1742-4658","1742-464X"],"issue":"1","journal":"FEBS Journal","last_mentioned_on":1351848226,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12052\/abstract;jsessionid=9EB7BE1171749E647CF31A8AC9BC9C5E.d02t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/febs.12052\/pdf","pmid":"23122426","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"93","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Expression of steroid 5\u00ce\u00b1\u00e2\u0080\u0090reductase isozymes in prostate of adult rats after environmental stress","type":"article","volume":"280","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-steroid-5alphareductase-isozymes-prostate-adult-rats-after-environmental-stress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6411338,"mean":5.9879951133434,"rank":4739301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":949106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6411338,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91365,"mean":5.8053341359835,"rank":59893,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91365,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1900,"mean":1.6514723538705,"rank":1010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1900,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
