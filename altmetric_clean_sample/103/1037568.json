Size was found to increase as the visible scene extended farther into the distance and to decrease as the moon rose above the vista of surface texture. In the second experiment, the observers' eye accommodation distances to various scenes were also measured with a laser optometer, and after appropriate transformations, size judgments were found to correlate 0.89 with measured accommodation values, thereby suggesting the hypothesis that the fabled moon illusion is mediated by the oculomotor adjustments of visual accommodation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005765","first_seen_on":"2012-11-02T15:34:07+00:00","issns":["0095-6562"],"issue":"1","journal":"Aviation, Space & Environmental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1351870429,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6830556"],"pmid":"6830556","pubdate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","aerospacemedicine"],"title":"The moon illusion revisited.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/moon-illusion-revisited"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":2018174,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78721,"mean":5.1750779979675,"rank":38398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27125,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78721,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":421,"mean":3.0020571428571,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":421,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.25,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":{"Medicine":1,"Psychology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/markhurst\/statuses\/264389861027491840","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1037568],"posted_on":"2012-11-02T15:33:49+00:00","author":{"name":"Mark Hurst","url":"http:\/\/creativegood.com","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1792702504\/markhurst1-cropped_normal.jpg","description":"Founder & CEO, Creative Good: http:\/\/creativegood.com.
