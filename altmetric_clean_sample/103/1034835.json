Caloric prescriptions (P), effective intake (I), and caloric needs (N), calculated with modified Harris-Benedict formulas, were recorded during seven consecutive days in ventilated patients. Adequacy of prescription was estimated by P\/N ratio. I\/P ratio assessed accuracy of translating a prescription into administered feeding. I\/N ratio compared delivered calories with theoretical caloric needs. Fifty patients were prospectively studied in a mixed medicosurgical ICU in a teaching hospital. Basal and total energy expenditure were, respectively, 1361 \u00b1 171 kcal\/d and 1649 \u00b1 233 kcal\/d. P and I attained 1536 \u00b1 602 kcal\/d and 1424 \u00b1 572 kcal\/d, respectively. 24.6% prescriptions were accurate, and 24.3% calories were correctly administered. Excessive calories were prescribed in 35.4% of patients, 27.4% being overfed. Caloric needs were underestimated in 40% prescriptions, with 48.3% patients underfed. Calculating caloric requirements by a modified standard formula covered energy needs in only 25% of long-term mechanically ventilated patients, leaving many over- or underfed. Nutritional imbalance mainly resulted from incorrect prescription. Failure of \"simple\" calculations to direct caloric prescription in these patients suggests systematic use of more reliable methods, for example, indirect calorimetry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088c9","authors":["De Waele E","Spapen H","Honor\u00e9 PM","Mattens S","Rose T","Huyghens L"],"doi":"10.1100\/2012\/909564","first_seen_on":"2012-11-01T10:06:24+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"The Scientific World Journal","last_mentioned_on":1351764979,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22675272?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22675272","pubdate":"2012-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Bedside calculation of energy expenditure does not guarantee adequate caloric prescription in long-term mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: a quality control study.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bedside-calculation-energy-expenditure-not-guarantee-adequate-caloric-prescription-longterm-mechanic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631265,"mean":4.9266893682253,"rank":2898509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631265,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78823,"mean":5.1719222044607,"rank":58751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78823,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1128,"mean":1.817636202307,"rank":733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.275,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":4},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/263944982363250688","license":"public","citation_ids":[1034835],"posted_on":"2012-11-01T10:06:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"263944982363250688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/263947570596950016","license":"public","citation_ids":[1034835],"posted_on":"2012-11-01T10:16:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"263947570596950016"}]}}
