We report 2 years activity of the geriatric assessment consultation of our institution, and its impact on therapeutic decision Methods: Since January 2007, we propose a geriatric consultation for elderly cancer patients for whom therapeutic decision appears complex to oncologists. This consultation included a CGA, with focuses on items like comorbidity, dependance, cognitive impairment, depression and malnutrition using international well known scales.\n161 patients (57 men, 104 women) (median age 82,4 years, extremes 73 -97) were seen at the geriatric consultation. Most of the patients (134\/161) were in fist line treatment for colorectal (54), other digestive (28), breast (30) and pulmonary (14) cancers. Cancer was metastatic in 86 patients (53 %). Geriatric assessment found: severe comorbidity (grade 3 or 4 in CIRS-G scale) in 75 patients, dependance for at least one activity of daily living (ADL) in 52 patients, cognitive impairment in 42 patients, including 13 patients with already diagnosed Alzheimer disease, malnutrition in 104 patients (65 %), depression in 39 patients. According to prior oncologist decision, there have been no change in therapeutic decision in 29 patients only. Geriatric interventional treatment was delivered to 122 patients (76 %). Anticancer treatment was changed in 79 patients (49 %), including delayed therapy in 5 patients, less intensive therapy in 29 patients and more intensive therapy in 45 patients. Patients for whom final decision was delayed or less intensive therapy had significantly more frequent severe comorbidity (23\/34, p < 0.01) and dependance for at least one ADL (19\/34, p < 0.01). Patients for whom final decision was more intensive therapy had significantly more frequent metastatic disease (33\/45, p < 0.01) Conclusions: Geriatric evaluation did influence therapeutic decision in 82 % of the patients. Follow up data will be presented to evaluate quality of final therapeutic decision, especially data concerning dose intensity and toxicity for patients with a more intensive therapy final decision.
