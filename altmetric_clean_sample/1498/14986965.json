This catalytic activity appears to be unique to living systems. Its applicability requires very few assumptions concerning the chemical nature of \"life.\" Data obtained so far indicate that the experiment is sound and technically feasible.","ads_id":"1967Sci...155.1110K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Bessel Kok","Joseph E.
