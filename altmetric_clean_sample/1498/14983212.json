It produces blood nicotine concentrations similar to tobacco smoking and so relieves symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Owing partly to the slower rate of absorption of nicotine through the buccal mucosa, however, it does not reproduce the pleasure of cigarette smoking. Indeed, in the early stages it is usually slightly aversive. Optimal use in a skill requiring practice and careful instruction. Since it is an aid rather than easy cure, its use is limited to smokers who want to stop. Earlier trials showed modest advantages over placebo, but improvements in the gum and more experience in its use suggest that long-term success rates of 40% or more can be obtained. It required little time to administer and is therefore a feasible method for busy doctors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["M A Russell","M Raw","M J Jarvis"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmj.280.6231.1599","endpage":"1602","first_seen_on":"2016-12-23T21:22:22+00:00","issns":["0007-1447","1468-5833"],"issue":"6231","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":504921600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmj.280.6231.1599"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/bmj\/280\/6231\/1599.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1601895","pmid":"7000247","pubdate":"1980-06-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1599","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Clinical use of nicotine chewing-gum.","type":"article","volume":"280","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-nicotine-chewinggum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6832606,"mean":6.1894962021047,"rank":1591814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4510378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6832606,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96928,"mean":11.121941791245,"rank":28804,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":66767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96928,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29002,"mean":21.921030929968,"rank":16563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":9591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29002,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":407,"mean":46.642147783251,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":407,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Environmental Tobacco Smoke: Measuring Exposures and Assessing Health Effects","url":"https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/download\/943","license":"public","citation_ids":[14983129,14583942,14983130,782232,4607616,14983131,2251669,14983136,3605905,16921818,14983137,14983138,14983142,14983144,3211364,14983145,16668399,14983147,14716380,14983148,1116815,14983149,3125970,14983155,14983162,14983176,14983177,14583202,18252992,16702559,936478,16680422,14589860,14983178,14983180,14983181,14983157,14983182,14983184,14983186,14983187,5859662,14983189,14983190,14983191,14983165,14983192,14983193,14590051,14983194,14983195,16702486,14983196,14983197,14983198,14983199,18252994,14983200,14983201,14983202,14983159,14983204,14584192,14983208,14983209,14983210,14983211,2073889,14983212,14983216,14983218,14983219,14983160,14983223,14592071,14983224,14983225,14983226,14983227,14983228,14983229,14983230,14983231,14983233,14983235,14983236,14983237,14983240,14983241,14983243,14983244,14983245,14983246,14983247,18253002,18253003,18253004,18253006,18253007,16610218,18253009,14983250,18253010,14983251,14482227,14482229,14478622,14983253,14983255,2743593,14983256,14983257,14983258,18253011,14983260,14983262,14983265,14983158,14983164,14983166,16673430,14983168,14983169,14983170,14572300,18252990,2404513,18252991,1532710,14983172,14983173,14983175,14983267,14983273,6670292,14983277,14590846,14592168,14983278,14983281,14983283,398861,14983284,14983285,14983289,14983290,14983291,176502,14983292,14983295,14983297,14983299,14983300,8252974,14983310,14580799,14510106,14983313,14983314,14983315,3170328,3115136],"posted_on":"1986-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Academies Press","description":"The US National Academies Press (NAP) was created by the National Academy of Sciences to publish the reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, operating under a charter granted by the Congress of the United States.
