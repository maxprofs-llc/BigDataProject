BACE1 (\u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the \u03b2-cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to A\u03b2 peptides. In this study, endogenous A\u03b2 and C99 accumulation was explored in N2a Swe cells exposed to 1% FBS medium. Increased A\u03b2 and C99 levels were significantly attenuated by taxifolin alone and in combination with cilostazol. Increased phosphorylated JAK2 at Tyr1007\/1008 (P-JAK), phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr 705 (P-STAT3) expressions and increased expressions of BACE1 mRNA and protein in the activated N2a Swe cells were significantly attenuated by taxifolin (10~50 \u03bcM), cilostazol (10~50 \u03bcM) alone and in combination at minimum concentrations. In these cells, decreased cytosol I\u03baB\u03b1 expression was elevated, and increased nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 level and nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 DNA binding activity were significantly reduced by taxifolin and cilostazol in a similar manner. Following STAT3 gene (~70% reduction) knockdown in N2a cells, A\u03b2-induced nuclear NF-\u03baB and BACE1 expressions were not observed. Taxifolin, cilostazol, or resveratrol significantly stimulated SIRT1 protein expression. In SIRT1 gene-silenced (~50%) N2a cells, taxifolin, cilostazol, and resveratrol all failed to suppress A\u03b21-42-stimulated P-STAT3 and BACE1 expression. Consequently, taxifolin and cilostazol were found to significantly decrease lipopolysaccharide (1-10 \u03bcg\/ml)-induced iNOS and COX-2 expressions, and nitrite production in cultured BV-2 microglia cells and to increase N2a cell viability. In conclusion, taxifolin and cilostazol strongly inhibited amyloidogenesis in a synergistic manner by suppressing P-JAK2\/P-STAT3-coupled NF-\u03baB-linked BACE1 expression via the up-regulation of SIRT1.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Park, So Youn","Kim, Hae Young","Park, Hee Jeong","Shin, Hwa Kyoung","Hong, Ki Whan","Kim, Chi Dae"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0168286","first_seen_on":"2016-12-24T01:00:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1482534783,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27977755"],"pmcid":"PMC5158044","pmid":"27977755","pubdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0168286","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Concurrent Treatment with Taxifolin and Cilostazol on the Lowering of \u03b2-Amyloid Accumulation and Neurotoxicity via the Suppression of P-JAK2\/P-STAT3\/NF-\u03baB\/BACE1 Signaling Pathways","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/concurrent-treatment-taxifolin-cilostazol-lowering-%CE%B2amyloid-accumulation-neurotoxicity-via-suppressi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":1103253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6752071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251718,"mean":12.47769723936,"rank":52860,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":195411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251718,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111378,"mean":10.339613439041,"rank":22365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":88410,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111378,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3876,"mean":12.788266322581,"rank":906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":2926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3876,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
