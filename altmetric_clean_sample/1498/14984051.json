The toxicity of vanadium (as it is measured by growth depression and mortality) was much greater when vanadium was added to a semipurified diet than when it was added to a practical diet containing natural ingredients. When EDTA was added to diets containing 50 to 200 p.p.m. vanadium, the growth depression was reduced from 22.1% and 75.9% to 8.4% and 36.7% respectively, and the mortality was reduced from 80% to 20% among chicks fed 200 p.p.m. vanadium. The addition of 10% lactose to a diet containing 100 p.p.m. vanadium increased the growth depression from 41% to 76.2% and caused 80% mortality. Chromium added to diets containing 100 and 200 p.p.m. vanadium improved the growth and reduced the mortality.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003375","authors":["Youssef S. M. Hafez","F. H.
