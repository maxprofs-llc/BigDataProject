A total of 3399 women who completed psychosocial questionnaires at recruitment were invited to complete questionnaires at 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. Linear mixed models were used to investigate differences between arms in the two psychosocial outcomes. Each outcome had a maximum score of 100, and higher scores represented higher psychosocial morbidity.\nOn average, over 30 months, women randomised to colposcopy scored 2.5 points (95%CI -3.6 to -1.3) lower for follow-up related worries than women randomised to cytological surveillance. Women in the colposcopy arm also scored significantly lower for follow-up related satisfaction with information and support (-2.4; -3.3 to -1.4) over 30 months. For both outcomes, the average difference between arms was greatest at 12th- and 18th-month time points. These differences remained when the analysis was stratified by post-school education.\nWomen with low-grade cytology, irrespective of their management, have substantial initial psychosocial morbidity that reduces over time. Implementation of newer screening strategies, which include surveillance, such as primary HPV screening, need to consider the information and support provided to women. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.
