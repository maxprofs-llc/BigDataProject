This project investigated metal plaque content(s) and metal uptake in reeds grown in an AMD field in winter and spring. The results indicated that the level of Fe plaque was much higher than Mn and Al plaque as the soil contained more Fe than Al and Mn. The amounts of Mn and Al plaque formed on reeds in spring were not significantly different from that in winter (p\u2009>\u2009.05). However, more Fe plaque was formed on reeds collected in spring. The concentrations of metals in underground organs were positively related to the metal levels in soils. More Mn and Al transferred to the aboveground tissues of reeds during the spring while the Fe levels in reeds did not significantly vary with seasons. Roots and rhizomes were the main organs for Fe sequestration (16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.15\u2005mg\/g in roots in spring) while most Al was sequestered in the shoots of reeds (2.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2005mg\/g in shoots in spring). Further research may be needed to enhance the translocation of metals in reeds and increase the phytoremediation efficiency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f61000114d","authors":["Lin Guo"],"doi":"10.1080\/09593330.2015.1133716","endpage":"1828","first_seen_on":"2016-12-23T22:40:40+00:00","issns":["0959-3330","1479-487X"],"issue":"14","journal":"Environmental Technology","last_mentioned_on":1482510000,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09593330.2015.1133716"],"pmid":"26789500","pubdate":"2016-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1821","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Bioaccumulation of metals in reeds collected from an acid mine drainage contaminated site in winter and spring","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioaccumulation-metals-reeds-collected-acid-mine-drainage-contaminated-site-winter-spring"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7926939,"mean":6.7044594278339,"rank":1462157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6446481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7926939,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251631,"mean":12.435289925684,"rank":65334,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":184205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251631,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":1.8455860215054,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4833333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
