In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["S D Elliott","M McCarty","R C Lancefield"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.145.3.490","endpage":"499","first_seen_on":"2016-12-23T22:58:41+00:00","issns":["0022-1007","1540-9538"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":536457600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1084\/jem.145.3.490"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/jem\/145\/3\/490.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2180704","pmid":"45589","pubdate":"1977-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"490","subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis)","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/teichoic-acids-group-d-streptococci-special-reference-strains-pig-meningitis-streptococcus-suis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6835504,"mean":6.1886420744723,"rank":1592243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4510240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6835504,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97073,"mean":11.122604808802,"rank":28881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":66827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97073,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3266,"mean":6.1124765696784,"rank":866,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3266,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":48.865806451613,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Biographical Memoirs V.57","url":"https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/download\/1000","license":"public","citation_ids":[18197096,14986827,14986832,14986837,14986841,14986848,14986851,14986856,14986859,14986863,14986867,14986871,14986875,14986882,14986893,14986894,14986898,16589216,14986900,14986903,14986906,16589218,14986910,14986912,14986915,14986919,14986922,14986925,16589221,16589222,16589223,16589224,14986926,14986931,14986933,14986936,14986938,14986941,3175177,14986943,14986944,14986947,14986949,14986951,14986957,14986959,14986960,14986962,3291260,14986963,14986965,14986966,14986967,14986968,14986971,14986972,14986973,14986976,3162942,14986978,14986980,14986982],"posted_on":"1987-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Academies Press","description":"The US National Academies Press (NAP) was created by the National Academy of Sciences to publish the reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, operating under a charter granted by the Congress of the United States.
