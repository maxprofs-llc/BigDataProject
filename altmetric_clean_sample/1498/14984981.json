Data were obtained from chart abstraction. Patients not confirmed for unstable angina by a clinical algorithm were eliminated.\nFor 1997-1998, 1116 (87.7%) of all identified cases were clinically confirmed for unstable angina, and 1176 (90.3%) were confirmed for 1999. In 1997-1998, 235 (21%) of unstable angina patients had troponin measured, compared to 822 (70%) in 1999. From 1999, patients with troponin measurement, vs. those without, more likely had typical angina (50.9%, 37.4%), chest pain on arrival (72.8%, 57.1%), and chest pain at rest (45.4%, 37.2%) and more often received EKG within 20 min of presentation (46.3%, 27.9%) (P<.0005 for all). Patients with abnormal troponin levels more often received angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (54.6%, 18.3%), cardiac catheterization (45.4%, 31.2%), and percutaneous coronary intervention (18.6%, 4.8%) (P<.05 for all). These associations remained significant after multivariable adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics.\nThis study demonstrates increasing and appropriate use of troponin before guideline release. Our findings suggest that guidelines may codify currently accepted practice rather than always disseminate new knowledge. The same forces that lead to guideline development and release may also lead to changes in clinical practice before guideline release.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Centor, Robert M","Allison, Jeroan J","Weissman, Norman W","Canto, John","Heudebert, Gustavo","Juarez, Lucia","Kiefe, Catarina I","R Centor"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0895-4356(03)00200-2","endpage":"1243","first_seen_on":"2016-12-23T21:58:20+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["0895-4356","08954356"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Clinical Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1136073600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0895-4356(03)00200-2"],"pmid":"14680675","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1236","subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Diffusion of troponin testing in unstable angina patients: adoption prior to guideline release","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0895435603002002","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/diffusion-troponin-testing-unstable-angina-patients-adoption-prior-guideline-release"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6833989,"mean":6.1891118392338,"rank":1592029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4510309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6833989,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96959,"mean":11.123406856577,"rank":28822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":66774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96959,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1193,"mean":6.3953003355705,"rank":405,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1193,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.1142857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
