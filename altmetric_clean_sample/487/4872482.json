As an important benchmark system, we report on the measurements of the absorption and refractive index for liquid water in the frequency range from 5 GHz to 1.12 THz (0.17-37.36 cm(-1) or 0.268-60 mm). The system provides a coherent radiation source with power up to 20 mW in the gigahertz-to-terahertz region. The dynamic range of our instrument reaches 10(12) and the system achieves a spectral resolution of less than 100 Hz. The temperature of samples can be controlled precisely with error bars of \u00b10.02\u2009\u00b0C from 0\u2009\u00b0C to 90\u2009\u00b0C. Given these attributes, our spectrometer provides unique capabilities for the accurate measurement of even very strongly absorbing materials such as aqueous solutions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003488","authors":["Deepu K.
