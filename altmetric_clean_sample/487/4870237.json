This involves the interaction of unphosphorylated EIIA(Glc) , a component of the glucose-specific PTS, with the CsrD protein, which accelerates the decay of the CsrB and CsrC small RNAs via RNase E in Escherichia coli. Since unphosphorylated EIIA(Glc) is generated in the presence of glucose, the PTS thus acts as a sensor of glucose for the Csr system. Interestingly, another pathway can operate for communication between the Csr system and the glucose-specific PTS. The absence of glucose generates phosphorylated EIIA(Glc) , which activates the enzyme adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP that, in turn, binds to the regulator CRP. Leng et al. show that the complex cAMP-CRP modestly reduces CsrB decay independently of CsrD. On the other hand, a previous study indicates that the complex cAMP-CRP positively regulates the transcription of CsrB and CsrC in Salmonella enterica. Therefore, EIIA(Glc) could work as a molecular switch that regulates the activity of the Csr system, in response to its phosphorylation state determined by the presence or absence of glucose, in order to control gene expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["P\u00e9rez\u2010Morales, Deyanira","Bustamante, V\u00edctor H."],"doi":"10.1111\/mmi.13285","first_seen_on":"2015-12-12T12:20:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2958"],"journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1450142840,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/mmi.13285","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26593223"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/mmi.13285\/pdf","pmid":"26593223","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"The global regulatory system Csr senses glucose through the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-regulatory-system-csr-senses-glucose-through-phosphoenolpyruvate-carbohydrate-phosphotransfer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3065984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3524241,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285268,"mean":8.6343586955378,"rank":130868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":142236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285268,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2358,"mean":3.0148383538396,"rank":1394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2358,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.1436438356164,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
