Sample Prep"],"citation":{"abstract":"In the six decades since its discovery, phosphorylase kinase (PhK) from rabbit skeletal muscle has usually been studied at 30 \u00b0C; in fact, not a single study has examined functions of PhK at a rabbit's body temperature, which is nearly 10 \u00b0C greater. Thus, we have examined aspects of the activity, regulation and structure of PhK at temperatures between 0 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C. Between 0 and 30 \u00b0C, the activity at pH 6.8 of nonphosphorylated PhK predictably increased; however, between 30 and 40 \u00b0C there was a dramatic jump in its activity, resulting in the non-activated enzyme having a far greater activity at body temperature than was previously realized. This anomalous change in properties between 30 and 40 \u00b0C was observed for multiple functions, and both stimulation (by ADP and phosphorylation) and inhibition (by orthophosphate) were considerably less pronounced at 40 versus 30 \u00b0C. In general, the allosteric control of PhK's activity is definitely more subtle at body temperature. Changes in behavior related to activity at 40 \u00b0C and its control can be explained by the near disappearance of hysteresis at physiological temperature. In important ways, the picture of PhK that has emerged from six decades of study at temperatures \u2264 30 \u00b0C does not coincide with that of the enzyme studied at physiological temperature. The probable underlying mechanism for the dramatic increase in PhK's activity between 30 and 40 \u00b0C is an abrupt change in the conformations of the regulatory \u03b2 and catalytic \u03b3 subunits between these two temperatures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c7","authors":["Julio E.
