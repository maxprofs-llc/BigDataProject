Study 1 confirmed significantly poorer passage-reading comprehension than the typically developing group. In an experimental task, readers with Down syndrome understood fewer written sentences than the typical group and, contrary to prediction, received no advantage from printed sentences compared to spoken sentences, despite the lower memory load. Reading comprehension was associated with listening comprehension, word reading and phonological awareness in DS. Vocabulary knowledge was also associated with reading comprehension, mediated by word reading and nonverbal cognitive abilities. Study 2 investigated the longitudinal relationships between reading and language measures in the readers with DS over around 22\u00a0months. Time 1 listening comprehension and phonological awareness predicted Time 2 reading comprehension but there was no evidence that reading or reading comprehension predicted Time 2 language scores or phonological awareness, and no evidence that readers had acquired greater depth of vocabulary.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6023cf058f6100063c8","authors":["Glynis Laws","Heather Brown","Elizabeth Main"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11145-015-9578-8","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T13:21:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0905","0922-4777"],"journal":"Reading & Writing","last_mentioned_on":1450187859,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11145-015-9578-8","http:\/\/download.springer.com\/static\/pdf\/79\/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11145-015-9578-8.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11145-015-9578-8&token2=exp=1447757684~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F79%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11145-015-9578-8.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11145-015-9578-8*~hmac=011fe6f876bf630a102967fd4df65aa3765d3cc6952e75b7bf841dc28ebb4da9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11145-015-9578-8.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4712222","pmid":"26798203","pubdate":"2015-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education (general)","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Interdisciplinary Studies","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Languages and Literature","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psycholinguistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Reading comprehension in children with Down syndrome","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reading-comprehension-children-down-syndrome-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":3008758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":3705957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287506,"mean":8.67128842281,"rank":128882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":155591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287506,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236,"mean":2.9565191489362,"rank":127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.095652173913,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
