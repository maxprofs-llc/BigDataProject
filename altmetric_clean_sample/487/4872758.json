The ability to observe molecular properties at the single-molecule level allows characterization of subpopulations and acquisition of detailed kinetic information that would otherwise be hidden in the averaging over an ensemble of molecules. In this Perspective, we discuss how such approaches have successfully been applied to in vitro-reconstituted systems of increasing complexity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Antoine M van Oijen","Nicholas E Dixon"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsmb.3119","endpage":"952","first_seen_on":"2015-12-13T22:14:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1545-9985","1545-9993"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1450044864,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v22\/n12\/full\/nsmb.3119.html"],"pmid":"26643847","pubdate":"2015-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Single-molecule biophysics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular biophysics","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"948","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Probing molecular choreography through single-molecule biochemistry","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probing-molecular-choreography-through-singlemolecule-biochemistry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":3247390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1997236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285528,"mean":8.6625778087536,"rank":144670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":109995,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285528,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1811,"mean":8.1096287292818,"rank":1210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1811,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":23.565288888889,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
