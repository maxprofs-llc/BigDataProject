We present an easily applicable approach for the guidance of transseptal puncture that uses the combination of a 3D mapping system and CT- derived 3D-overlayed anatomy.\nA computer tomographic (CT) LA-angiography was performed in n = 65 patients prior to a scheduled atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. The CARTO3\u00ae (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, USA) segmentation tool was used to create a 3D reconstruction of cardiac anatomy and the spine. The CARTO UNIVU\u00ae module was then used to overlay and register the segmented 3D-anatomy onto fluoroscopy. The 3D-reconstructed spine and cardiac anatomy were congruently aligned to their fluoroscopic counterparts in fluoroscopic views. The feasibility of the technique, its safety and accuracy (assessed as contour offsets between 3D-overlay and angiographic LA anatomy) were evaluated. Overlay registration accuracy was analyzed by CARTO3\u00ae registration matrices. Transseptal puncture was feasible without complications in all 65 patients using the new 3D overlay technique. 3D-overlay contour offsets were 1.6 \u00b1 1.2 mm in left PV, 1.7 \u00b1 1.2 mm in right PV, and 1.3 \u00b1 1.0 mm in LA roof region. Overlay registration accuracy was 4.9 \u00b1 2.7 mm. Average time needed for anatomy segmentation was 204 \u00b1 61 sec, time needed for overlay registration was 18 \u00b1 8 sec.\n3D-augmented fluoroscopy is feasible, safe and easy to apply as guidance for transseptal puncture and demonstrates a high level of accuracy.
