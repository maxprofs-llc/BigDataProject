All patients were followed-up for the mean duration of 126 months.\nOn admission cranial nerve symptoms predominated. Total tumor removal was achieved in 5 patients, and incomplete removal (with small tumor remnants left on vessels, nerves, or brainstem) in 12 patients. Postoperatively, preoperative deficits worsened in 2 and new postoperative deficits occurred in 10 patients. The extent of tumor expansion had no effect on postoperative morbidity and risk of recurrence. During long-term follow-up, improvement or resolution of preoperative deficits was seen in 11 of 17 patients, and new postoperative deficits in 8 of 10 patients. Symptomatic recurrences after an average of more than 9 years were noted in 5 patients, 3 of whom were reoperated. Recurrences occurred in some younger patients and always in area of primary tumor. No effect of extent of tumor removal on risk of recurrence was found.\nThe extent of tumor removal had no effect on the risk of recurrence, and thus it may be acceptable to leave tumor capsule fragments adhering closely to nerves, vessels, or brainstem. During long-term follow-up, resolution or improvement of present preoperatively and new postoperative neurological deficits may be expected in most patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cf55","authors":["Czernicki, Tomasz","Kunert, Przemys\u0142aw","Nowak, Arkadiusz","Wojciechowski, Jakub","Marchel, Andrzej"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pjnns.2015.11.008","first_seen_on":"2015-12-12T20:46:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00283843","0028-3843"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska","last_mentioned_on":1466158238,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0028384315002005&_version=1&md5=b45814249435d139c453aa7f40e4d37a","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26969562?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26969562","pubdate":"2016-03-13T22:00:30+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery","neurology"],"title":"Epidermoid cysts of the cerebellopontine angle: Clinical features and treatment outcomes ","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidermoid-cysts-cerebellopontine-angle-clinical-features-treatment-outcomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7909849,"mean":6.6937446400934,"rank":5998439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1061381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7909849,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299743,"mean":8.8625423530901,"rank":206165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":50774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299743,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":1.5214932126697,"rank":101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":82,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.7263157894737,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/675777027899723778","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4871098],"posted_on":"2015-12-12T20:39:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":983},"tweet_id":"675777027899723778"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/braintumor_UL\/statuses\/743747674826956802","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4871098],"posted_on":"2016-06-17T10:10:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain tumor ULisboa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/687579003163643904\/d5iTojK9_normal.jpg","description":"Follow for the latest updates on Brain tumors.
