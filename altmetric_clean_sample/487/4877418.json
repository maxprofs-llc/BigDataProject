Four different virtual tumors were placed at separate locations. The transducer arrays were modeled to mimic the TTFields-delivering commercial device. For each tumor location, varying array layouts were tested. The finite element method was used to calculate the electric field distribution, taking into account tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy.\nIn all tumors, the average electric field induced by either of the 2 perpendicular array layouts exceeded the 1-V\/cm therapeutic threshold value for TTFields effectiveness. Field strength within a tumor did not correlate with its size and shape but was higher in more superficial tumors. Additionally, it always increased when the array was adapted to the tumor's location. Compared with a default layout, the largest increase in field strength was 184%, and the highest average field strength induced in a tumor was 2.21\u00a0V\/cm.\nThese results suggest that adapting array layouts to specific tumor locations can significantly increase field strength within the tumor. Our findings support the idea of personalized treatment planning to increase TTFields efficacy for patients with GBM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Wenger, Cornelia","Salvador, Ricardo","Basser, Peter J","Miranda, Pedro C","Cornelia Wenger","Ricardo Salvador","Peter J.
