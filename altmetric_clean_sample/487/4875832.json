Randomly selected subjects aged 65 and older without hip fracture were enrolled as controls (n\u00a0=\u00a09,081). Case and control groups were matched according to sex, comorbidities, and index year of hip fracture diagnosis.\nCurrent users of zopiclone were defined as those whose last remaining tablet of zopiclone was detected within 7\u00a0days or less before the date of hip fracture diagnosis. Late users of zopiclone were defined as those whose last remaining tablet of zopiclone was detected more than 7\u00a0days before the date of hip fracture diagnosis. Subjects who never received a prescription of zopiclone were defined as nonusers of zopiclone. A multivariable unconditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to investigate the correlation between zopiclone use and risk of hip fracture.\nAfter adjusting for confounders, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that current users of zopiclone were three and a half times as likely as nonusers to experience a hip fracture (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a03.56, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.33-4.84), whereas late users were essentially equally as likely as nonusers to experience a hip fracture (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.94-1.18).\nCurrent use of zopiclone was associated with greater risk of hip fracture in the elderly adults studied. Clinicians should alert elderly people to the risk of hip fracture when prescribing zopiclone.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f5a","authors":["Lai, Shih\u2010Wei","Lin, Cheng\u2010Li","Chen, Wen\u2010Chi","Liao, Kuan\u2010Fu","Shih-Wei Lai","Cheng-Li Lin","Wen-Chi Chen","Kuan-Fu Liao"],"doi":"10.1111\/jgs.13823","endpage":"2537","first_seen_on":"2015-12-14T21:05:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1532-5415"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","last_mentioned_on":1450155103,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13823\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jgs.13823\/pdf","pmid":"26662510","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2534","subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Correlation Between Use of Zopiclone and Risk of Hip Fracture in Elderly Adults: A Case\u2013Control Study in Taiwan","type":"article","volume":"63","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correlation-between-zopiclone-risk-hip-fracture-elderly-adults-casecontrol-study-taiwan-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":2289397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4452386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286991,"mean":8.6672536952506,"rank":85297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":199839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286991,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2542,"mean":11.895960645415,"rank":1415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2542,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":21.5316,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dtmaust\/statuses\/676508356534603777","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4875832],"posted_on":"2015-12-14T21:05:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Donovan Maust","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451826068568035328\/09p8mRpd_normal.jpeg","description":"Geriatric psychiatrist & health services researcher interested in #aging #dementia #benzodiazepines #deprescribing. #GoBlue.","id_on_source":"dtmaust","tweeter_id":"2426155513","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":506},"tweet_id":"676508356534603777"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/edudelgad\/statuses\/676516120828973056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4875832],"posted_on":"2015-12-14T21:36:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Edu Delgado","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/456820369031057409\/PGbDRNqw_normal.jpeg","description":"Antes geriatra, ahora tambi\u00e9n psiquiatra...\u00bfpsicogeriatra?","id_on_source":"edudelgad","tweeter_id":"503075526","geo":{"lt":40.42526,"ln":-3.69063,"country":"ES"},"followers":793},"tweet_id":"676516120828973056"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IlseWiechers\/statuses\/676581328712634368","license":"gnip","rt":["dtmaust"],"citation_ids":[4875832],"posted_on":"2015-12-15T01:55:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Ilse Wiechers","url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1PkqNgW","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/869996997020979201\/S_naRYY__normal.jpg","description":"Geropsychiatrist, policy enthusiast, data & tech geek, runner, coffee lover, improving healthcare for people with mental health problems","id_on_source":"IlseWiechers","tweeter_id":"893264544","geo":{"lt":37.45383,"ln":-122.18219,"country":"US"},"followers":468},"tweet_id":"676581328712634368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ConstanceFungMD\/statuses\/676625662703087616","license":"gnip","rt":["dtmaust"],"citation_ids":[4875832],"posted_on":"2015-12-15T04:51:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Constance Fung","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731337541484318720\/DvkBWNY4_normal.jpg","description":"Geriatrics and sleep medicine physician and health services researcher","id_on_source":"ConstanceFungMD","tweeter_id":"4025112592","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":53},"tweet_id":"676625662703087616"}]}}
