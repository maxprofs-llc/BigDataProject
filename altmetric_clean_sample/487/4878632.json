The greatest increase in new cases occurs between 15-18 years. Indian empirical studies have reported a prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the range between 14.4% and 31.7%; thus, affecting psychosocial functioning.\nThe objectives of the current study were to (i) examine the psychometric properties of the DASS and SDQ on Indian adolescents, (ii) explore the role of socio- demographic variablesand (iii) examine if there was any difference between school going and school dropouts.\nData from 1812 students, aged 12-19 years was collected with mean age = 15.67 years (SD =1.41 years). The participants were administered a booklet containing demographic questionnaire and psychometric scales such as DASS-21 (Henry & Crawford, 2005; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1999) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997).\nStructure validation, correlational analysis and multivariate analysis.\nThe results of validation indicated that English and Hindi version of 3 factor model of DASS and 2 factor model of SDQ was an acceptable model fit. It was noted that early adolescents were high on prosocial behaviour whereas late adolescents were high on difficulties score. Females were higher than males on prosocial behaviour. Adolescents residing in rural areas differed from their urban counterparts on prosocial behaviour and anxiety. Government school going adolescents differed from private school going adolescents on prosocial behaviour, stress and anxiety. Negative perception of relationship with family affected adolescents difficulties score, depression and stress. Similarly, negative perception of self-concept leads to higher difficulties score and lower prosocial behaviour score. The school going adolescents differed from non-school going adolescents on stress, depression and anxiety.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5263cf058f610003d93","authors":["Singh","Kamlesh Singh","Mohita Junnarkar","Soumya Sharma"],"doi":"10.4103\/0019-5545.171841","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T12:58:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0019-5545"],"issue":"4","journal":"Indian Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1450184320,"links":["http:\/\/www.indianjpsychiatry.org\/text.asp?2015\/57\/4\/367\/171841"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.indianjpsychiatry.org\/article.asp?issn=0019-5545;year=2015;volume=57;issue=4;spage=367;epage=374;aulast=Singh;type=2","pmcid":"PMC4711236","pmid":"26813517","pubdate":"2015-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","title":"Anxiety, stress, depression, and psychosocial functioning of Indian adolescents","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anxiety-stress-depression-psychosocial-functioning-indian-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":5027825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":981546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287506,"mean":8.6712905097302,"rank":194481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287506,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":567,"mean":4.4890247349823,"rank":349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":567,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.72,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
