ICG-001 is a small-molecule inhibitor that specifically inhibits the CBP\/catenin interaction. Importantly, ICG-001 does not inhibit the p300\/catenin interaction. We demonstrate that specifically inhibiting the interaction between CBP and catenin with ICG-001 results in the differentiation of quiescent drug-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia-initiating cells (CML LICs), thereby sensitizing them to BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for example, Imatinib. Using ICG-001 in a NOD\/SCID\/IL2R\u03b3(-\/-) mouse model of engrafted human chronic myelogenous leukemia, we now demonstrate the complete elimination of engrafted leukemia after only one course of combined chemotherapy. Combination-treated animals live as long as their non-engrafted littermates. Results from these studies demonstrate that specifically antagonizing the CBP\/catenin interaction with ICG-001 can eliminate drug-resistant CML LICs without deleterious effects to the normal endogenous hematopoietic stem cell population.Oncogene advance online publication, 14 December 2015; doi:10.1038\/onc.2015.438.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Y Zhao","D Masiello","M McMillian","C Nguyen","Y Wu","E Melendez","G Smbatyan","A Kida","Y He","J-L Teo","M Kahn"],"doi":"10.1038\/onc.2015.438","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T04:30:28+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci","nhlbi"],"issns":["0950-9232","1476-5594"],"issue":"28","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1505383685,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/onc2015438a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/onc2015438a.html?elq=0f47896dace84ec5befb5bc5944c4352&elqCampaignId=3&elqaid=14364&elqat=1&elqTrackId=e70bf664b8134f75b54aa81a48863868","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/onc2015438a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/onc\/journal\/v35\/n28\/full\/onc2015438a.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26657156?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26657156","pubdate":"2015-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chronic myeloid leukaemia","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"CBP|[sol]|catenin antagonist safely eliminates drug-resistant leukemia-initiating cells","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cbpcatenin-antagonist-safely-eliminates-drugresistant-leukemiainitiating-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.35,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414430,"mean":7.0825007427048,"rank":652854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7759703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414430,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":308818,"mean":9.0158809391967,"rank":30637,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":278063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":308818,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4344,"mean":4.7168431959475,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4344,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":3.4101777777778,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
