Data from the 2003-2006 NHANES were used (20\u00a0+ years; N\u00a0=\u00a05530). Participants wore an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer over a period of up to 7\u00a0days to assess accumulation in bouted and non-bouted MVPA. From 4 self-reported items, HRQOL was assessed using the CDC HRQOL-4 questionnaire, with a higher HRQOL-4 score indicating worse HRQOL. In a single multivariable ordinal regression analysis, both non-bout (\u03b2adjusted\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.01; 95% CI: -\u00a00.01 to -\u00a00.003; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and bouted (\u03b2adjusted\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.08; 95% CI: -\u00a00.15 to -\u00a00.01; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) MVPA were associated with HRQOL. Greater accumulation in both bouted and non-bouted MVPA was associated with better perceived HRQOL.","altmetric_jid":"537f30872a83eeb45a8b4648","authors":["Loprinzi, Paul D","Davis, Robert E"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pmedr.2015.12.005","first_seen_on":"2015-12-13T14:32:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["22113355","2211-3355"],"journal":"Preventive Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1450574680,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2211335515001771","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2211335515001771?via%3Dihub"],"pmcid":"PMC4733098","pmid":"26844186","pubdate":"2016-02-05T22:00:45+00:00","title":"Bouted and non-bouted moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with health-related quality of life ","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bouted-nonbouted-moderatetovigorous-physical-activity-healthrelated-quality-life-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6797067,"mean":6.1791144149531,"rank":2871761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3770368,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6797067,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":286499,"mean":8.6847387835167,"rank":119191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":157857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":286499,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":11.815981132075,"rank":134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.9090909090909,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
