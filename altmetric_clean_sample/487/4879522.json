While it is believed that spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and truly pluripotent ESC-like cells can be isolated from adult mice, it remained unknown if the spontaneous conversion of SSCs to ESC-like cells fails at some age. Similarly, there have been differences in the literature about the duration of cultures during which ESC-like cells may appear. We demonstrate the possibility to derive ESC-like cells from SSC cultures until they reach adolescence or up to 7 weeks of age, but we point out the impossibility to derive these cells from older, mature adult mice. The inability of real adult SSCs to shift to a pluripotent state coincides with a decline in expression of the core pluripotency genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in SSCs with age. At the same time genes of the spermatogonial differentiation pathway increase. The generated ESC-like cells were similar to ESCs and express pluripotency markers. In vitro they differentiate into all three germ lineages; they form complex teratomas after transplantation in SCID mice and produce chimeric mice.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5363cf058f61000460b","authors":["Azizi, Hossein","Conrad, Sabine","Hinz, Ursula","Asgari, Behrouz","Nanus, Daniel","Peterziel, Heike","Hajizadeh Moghaddam, Akbar","Baharvand, Hossein","Skutella, Thomas"],"doi":"10.1155\/2016\/8216312","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T16:55:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1687-966X"],"journal":"Stem Cells International","last_mentioned_on":1450751911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26664410?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4655302","pmid":"26664410","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Derivation of Pluripotent Cells from Mouse SSCs Seems to Be Age Dependent.","type":"article","volume":"2016","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/derivation-pluripotent-cells-mouse-sscs-seems-age-dependent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6810016,"mean":6.1874355128406,"rank":2879673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3775016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6810016,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288441,"mean":8.6956297670224,"rank":120076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":158858,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288441,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":2.081873015873,"rank":110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":1.9318023255814,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
