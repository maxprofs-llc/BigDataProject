Here we report a high-efficient self-charging power system for sustainable operation of mobile electronics exploiting exclusively human biomechanical energy, which consists of a high-output triboelectric nanogenerator, a power management circuit to convert the random a.c. energy to d.c. electricity at 60% efficiency, and an energy storage device. With palm tapping as the only energy source, this power unit provides a continuous d.c. electricity of 1.044\u2009mW (7.34\u2009W\u2009m(-3)) in a regulated and managed manner. This self-charging unit can be universally applied as a standard 'infinite-lifetime' power source for continuously driving numerous conventional electronics, such as thermometers, electrocardiograph system, pedometers, wearable watches, scientific calculators and wireless radio-frequency communication system, which indicates the immediate and broad applications in personal sensor systems and internet of things.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008259","authors":["Simiao Niu","Xiaofeng Wang","Fang Yi","Yu Sheng Zhou","Zhong Lin Wang"],"doi":"10.1038\/ncomms9975","first_seen_on":"2015-12-12T12:16:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2041-1733","2041-1723"],"journal":"Nature Communications","last_mentioned_on":1453469216,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151123\/ncomms9975\/full\/ncomms9975.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms9975.epdf?shared_access_token=ovZ7pUzNNOplgwC2cxUBQNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NN_XHMQNklpjT9AwpCywWowHIkZAgq5Bo2cyxR_CxoytLHOdkwGb0x-e7TKX6lPwkIMHnk4Cdpzp34O7h3FiKbM8nB1NQoKBcC1B99r2Ob-3Sw3Qs39pIj8HqvMpRLMlY%3D","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ncomms\/2015\/151123\/\/ncomms9975\/pdf\/ncomms9975.pdf","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ncomms9975","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1038\/ncomms9975","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/ncomms9975.epdf?shared_access_token=fJVJWNOpeAW_z2uMvBO6VtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NN_XHMQNklpjT9AwpCywWowHIkZAgq5Bo2cyxR_CxoyodxTbGcp1d_VI1POin7jcuKScZPHLdScyxUL2EILd8XUcwnnXAlA8Z5Tr4_-9r6I0s7ymDdCJ4haCJxVQoy6qY%3D"],"pmcid":"PMC4682168","pmid":"26656252","pubdate":"2015-12-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"title":"A universal self-charging system driven by random biomechanical energy for sustainable operation of mobile electronics","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/universal-selfcharging-system-driven-random-biomechanical-energy-sustainable-operation-mobile-electr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":101.848,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":101.848},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7007649,"mean":6.258769735863,"rank":60082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":6947759,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7007649,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288989,"mean":8.7245454828573,"rank":4516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":284473,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288989,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10648,"mean":39.800064055602,"rank":1060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":9588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10648,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":46.887311004785,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":540,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
