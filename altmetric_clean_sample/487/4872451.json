The family consists of Y-linked DAZ, and autosomal homologs Boule and Dazl. All three genes encode RNA-binding proteins that are nearly exclusively expressed in germ cells. The DAZ family is highly conserved, with ancestral Boule present in sea anemones through humans, Dazl conserved among vertebrates, and DAZ present only in higher primates. Here we review studies on DAZ family genes from multiple organisms, and summarize the common features of each DAZ gene and their roles during spermatogenesis in animals. DAZ family proteins are thought to activate the translation of RNA targets, but recent work has uncovered additional functions. Boule, Dazl, and DAZ likely function through similar mechanisms, and we present known functions of the DAZ family in spermatogenesis, and discuss possible mechanisms in addition to translation activation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc82","authors":["Vangompel, Michael J W","Xu, Eugene Y"],"doi":"10.4161\/spmg.1.1.14659","first_seen_on":"2015-12-13T18:27:39+00:00","issns":["2156-5554"],"issue":"1","journal":"Spermatogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1450031252,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22523742","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4161\/spmg.1.1.14659","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3329454"],"pmcid":"PMC3329454","pmid":"22523742","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The roles of the DAZ family in spermatogenesis: More than just translation?","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/roles-daz-family-spermatogenesis-roles-daz-family-spermatogenesis-more-just-translation-n-d-e-s-i-o"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":1568691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4488776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285529,"mean":8.6625271567061,"rank":80225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":201515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285529,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.9893684210526,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"BOLL","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=695090137#altmetric_citation_6b310618-b078-4d62-8bc6-cddbde0d058e","license":"public","citation_ids":[4872451],"posted_on":"2015-12-13T18:27:32+00:00","summary":"Protein boule-like is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BOLL gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14881630","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Njboule","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Njboule"}}]}}
