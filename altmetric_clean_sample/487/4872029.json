Levels of 25OHD and GA in maternal and cord blood were measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme assay, respectively. Using cord serum, 12 diabetes-related hormones were assayed. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to quantify the strength of association between biomarkers.\nA prominent association between maternal and cord 25OHD levels (r = 0.76, 95% CIs: 0.73-0.79, p < 0.0001), and weak association between maternal and cord GA (r = 0.22, 95% CIs: 0.14-0.30, p < 0.0001) were shown. Among the 12 diabetes-related hormones, both maternal and cord 25OHD levels showed prominent negative associations with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).\nThese results suggest that decreased maternal 25OHD may be associated with decreased cord 25OHD and increased cord GLP-1 and GIP levels, which may be involved with the transfer of maternal glucose to the fetus.Pediatric Research (2015); doi:10.1038\/pr.2015.253.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f61000848b","authors":["Shimpei Niwa","Hidetoshi Mezawa","Naoaki Kobayashi","Hiroyuki Ida","Mitsuyoshi Urashima"],"doi":"10.1038\/pr.2015.253","first_seen_on":"2015-12-13T12:24:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1530-0447","0031-3998"],"journal":"Pediatric Research","last_mentioned_on":1450008628,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/pr\/journal\/vaop\/naam\/abs\/pr2015253a.html"],"pmid":"26650343","pubdate":"2015-12-13T22:00:19+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Endocrine system and metabolic diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Hormones","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Inverse association between maternal 25OHD level and cord GLP-1 \/ GIP concentrations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inverse-association-between-maternal-25ohd-level-cord-glp1-gip-concentrations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6743544,"mean":6.1672983391654,"rank":5001161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":980681,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6743544,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285528,"mean":8.6625583710121,"rank":193132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":54772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285528,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1099,"mean":4.5521839708561,"rank":800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1099,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":8.6541025641026,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Cord_Blood_News\/statuses\/676011299009118208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4872029],"posted_on":"2015-12-13T12:10:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Cord Blood News","url":"http:\/\/www.cordbloodresearchnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748299655331491840\/GQ_DrX5u_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the cord blood community.
