Thus, the intracellular ATP supply is required to maintain cellular homeostasis. The dependence on the intracellular ATP supply is a critical factor in bioproduction by cell factories. Recent studies have shown that changing the ATP supply is critical for improving product yields. In this review, we summarize the recent challenges faced by researchers engaged in the development of engineered cell factories, including the maintenance of a large ATP supply and the production of cell factories. The strategies used to enhance ATP supply are categorized as follows: addition of energy substrates, controlling pH, metabolic engineering of ATP-generating or ATP-consuming pathways, and controlling reactions of the respiratory chain. An enhanced ATP supply generated using these strategies improves target production through increases in resource uptake, cell growth, biosynthesis, export of products, and tolerance to toxic compounds.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086e","authors":["Kiyotaka Y Hara","Akihiko Kondo"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12934-015-0390-6","first_seen_on":"2015-12-15T11:50:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1475-2859"],"issue":"1","journal":"Microbial Cell Factories","last_mentioned_on":1450180176,"links":["http:\/\/www.microbialcellfactories.com\/content\/14\/1\/198\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.microbialcellfactories.com\/content\/pdf\/s12934-015-0390-6.pdf","pmcid":"PMC4676173","pmid":"26655598","pubdate":"2015-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"198","subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology"],"title":"ATP regulation in bioproduction","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atp-regulation-bioproduction-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6771968,"mean":6.1646290473641,"rank":5027821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":981551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6771968,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287505,"mean":8.6713151051811,"rank":194481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":55239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287505,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":468,"mean":2.7058244111349,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":468,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.0264117647059,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
