Quercetin, a bioactive flavonoid, is shown to exhibit anticarcinogenic effects against various cancers including breast cancer. Hence, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of gold nanoparticles-conjugated quercetin (AuNPs-Qu-5) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Borohydride reduced AuNPs were synthesized and conjugated with quercetin to yield AuNPs-Qu-5. Both were thoroughly characterized by several physicochemical techniques, and their cytotoxic effects were assessed by MTT assay. Apoptotic studies such as DAPI, AO\/EtBr dual staining, and annexin V-FITC staining were performed. AuNPs and AuNPs-Qu-5 were spherical with crystalline nature, and the size of particles range from 3.0 to 4.5 nm. AuNPs-Qu-5 exhibited lower IC50 value compared to free Qu. There was a considerable increase in apoptotic population with increased nuclear condensation seen upon treatment with AuNPs-Qu-5. To delineate the molecular mechanism behind its apoptotic role, we analysed the proteins involved in apoptosis and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated PI3K\/Akt\/GSK-3\u03b2 signalling by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. The pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Caspase-3) were found to be up regulated and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) was down regulated on treatment with AuNPs-Qu-5. Additionally, AuNPs-Qu-5 treatment inhibited the EGFR and its downstream signalling molecules PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR\/GSK-3\u03b2. In conclusion, administration of AuNPs-Qu-5 in breast cancer cell lines curtails cell proliferation through induction of apoptosis and also suppresses EGFR signalling. AuNPs-Qu-5 is more potent than free quercetin in causing cancer cell death, and hence, this could be a potential drug delivery system in breast cancer therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e13","authors":["Balakrishnan, Solaimuthu","Mukherjee, Sudip","Das, Sourav","Bhat, Firdous Ahmad","Raja Singh, Paulraj","Patra, Chitta Ranjan","Arunakaran, Jagadeesan"],"doi":"10.1002\/cbf.3266","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T10:13:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0263-6484","1099-0844"],"journal":"Cell Biochemistry and Function","last_mentioned_on":1494670356,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28498520?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28498520","pubdate":"2017-05-13T22:02:18+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Gold nanoparticles-conjugated quercetin induces apoptosis via inhibition of EGFR\/PI3K\/Akt-mediated pathway in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gold-nanoparticlesconjugated-quercetin-induces-apoptosis-via-inhibition-egfrpi3kaktmediated-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":7096936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237983,"mean":12.377652561958,"rank":193689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237983,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":1.7705141509434,"rank":393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.85,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
