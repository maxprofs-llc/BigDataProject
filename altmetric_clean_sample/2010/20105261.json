A differential expression of microRNAs in the endometriotic tissues from women with endometriosis with pain compared to those without suggested a plausible role for miRNA or epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of endometriotic pain. The peritoneal milieu is involved in maintenance of endometriotic lesion and nociception. We recently showed the mechanistic role for oxidized-lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) present in peritoneal fluid (PF) in endometriosis and pain. We explored the possibility of ox-LDLs modulating the expression of miRNAs in a manner similar to PF from women with endometriosis. Expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted nociceptive and inflammatory targets were determined in PF and ox-LDL treated human endometrial cell-lines. Samples from IRB-approved and consented patients with and without endometriosis or pain were used. These were compared to endometrial cell-lines treated with various forms of oxidized-lipoproteins. RNA (including miRNAs) were isolated from treated endometrial cells and expression levels were determined using commercial miRNome arrays. Cell lysates were used in immunoblotting for inflammatory proteins using a protein array. Twenty miRNAs including isoforms of miR-29, miR-181 and let-7 were mutually differentially expressed in cells treated with PF from endometriosis patients with pain and those treated with ox-LDL components. The ox-LDLs and endo-PF treatment also produced significant overexpression of microRNA predicted target genes nerve growth factor, interleukin-6 and prostaglandin E synthase and overexpression of their downstream protein targets Mip1\u03b1 and MCP1. This study showed similarities between miRNA regulation in PF from endometriotic women and ox-LDLs present in abundance in the PF of these women. Key miRNAs responsible for targeting nociceptive and inflammatory molecules were downregulated in the presence of ox-LDLs and endo-PF, thus playing a role in the etiology of endometriotic pain. These redox-sensitive miRNAs can be of potential use as targets in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain.","altmetric_jid":"5216115a3cf058827c000018","authors":["Kristeena Ray Wright","Brenda Mitchell","Nalini Santanam"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.redox.2017.04.037","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T10:18:31+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms"],"handles":[],"issns":["22132317","2213-2317"],"journal":"Redox Biology","last_mentioned_on":1494673151,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28499250?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28499250","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Redox regulation of microRNAs in endometriosis-associated pain","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/redox-regulation-micrornas-endometriosisassociated-pain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":6227024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1103922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237984,"mean":12.37758731506,"rank":168619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237984,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":358,"mean":6.134862745098,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":358,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":6.3077966101695,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/statuses\/863337568808484864","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20105261],"posted_on":"2017-05-13T10:18:11+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
