Here, we investigated the suppressive possibility of ethanol extract of Nannochloropsis oceanica (N. oceanica) on memory deficiency along with the fundamental mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice model. Among several extracts of 32 marine microalgae, ethanol extract of N. oceanica showed the most significant inhibitory effect on nitric oxide (NO) generation, NF-\u03baB activity and \u03b2-secretase activity in cultured BV-2 cells, neuronal cells and Raw 264.7 cells. Ethanol extract of N. oceanica (50, 100 mg\/kg) also ameliorated LPS (250 \u03bcg\/kg)-induced memory impairment. We also found that ethanol extract of N. oceanica inhibited the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2. Furthermore, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level as well as glutathione (GSH) level was also decreased by treatment of ethanol extract of N.oceanica. The ethanol extract of N. oceanica also suppresses I\u03baB degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into the nucleus in LPS-treated mice brain. Associated with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, ethanol extract of N. oceanica suppressed A\u03b21-42 generation through down-regulation of APP and BACE1 expression in in vivo. These results suggest that ethanol extract of N. oceanica ameliorated memory impairment via anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-amyloidogenic mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Ji Yeon Choi","Chul Ju Hwang","Hee Pom Lee","Hee Sik Kim","Sang-Bae Han","Jin Tae Hong"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.17268","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T12:31:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1494630843,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28489589"],"pmid":"28489589","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Inhibitory effect of ethanol extract of <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica<\/i> on lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, amyloidogensis and memory impairment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibitory-effect-ethanol-extract-inannochloropsis-oceanicai-lipopolysaccharideinduced-neuroinflamma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8193064,"mean":6.9264840328884,"rank":1178481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6940195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8193064,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237776,"mean":12.374304750289,"rank":49412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":186216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237776,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8752,"mean":3.1423492172323,"rank":477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":8185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8752,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1383,"mean":2.8780506512301,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":1316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1383,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
