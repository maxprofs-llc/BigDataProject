As in the previously reported Ni(II) adduct of tetraphenyl N-confused porphyrin, we observe sign reverse (positive to negative intensities with increasing energy) features in the MCD spectra of the neutral Ni(II), Pd(II), and Cu(II) complexes of PF-NCP, which is indicative of rare \u0394HOMO < \u0394LUMO relationships. Upon deprotonation of Ni(II), Pd(II), and Cu(II) complexes, these features revert to those of more typical porphyrin MCD spectra consistent with a \u0394HOMO > \u0394LUMO condition. The Cu(III) PF-NCP complex shows features similar to those of the deprotonated divalent metal systems. Spectroscopic features in all target complexes as well as previously published metal-free and Ni(II) NCP systems were correlated with the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. Calculation data are consistent with the tautomeric rearrangement of the electronic structures of NCP cores playing dominant roles, with smaller contribution from the central metal ions in the observed optical and magneto-optical properties. This is true for all described NCP systems to date, as they affect the stabilization\/destabilization of the N-confused porphyrin-centered Gouterman orbitals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Samantha Doble","Allen J.
