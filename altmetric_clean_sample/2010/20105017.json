A few years later, after his return to Greece, an operation performed on his closest friend's child, which led to fatal complications, led him to retire from surgical practice. William Halsted travelled to Europe in order to master European surgery, including at Vienna University, and about 20 years later he published his famous method for radical mastectomy, which appears to be identical to Ioannou's operation. This article debates whether Halsted studied Ioannou's method in the archives of Vienna University (and was encouraged by Ioannou's retirement to develop this technique), whether he learned about it through his peers, or whether this was simply a historical coincidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008a9a","authors":["Tsoucalas, Gregory","Vladimiros, Lazaros","Sgantzos, Markos"],"doi":"10.1177\/1553350617708724","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T10:09:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1553-3506","1553-3514"],"journal":"Surgical Innovation","last_mentioned_on":1494670146,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28494685?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28494685","pubdate":"2017-05-13T22:11:34+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Greek Surgeon Pavlos Ioannou\u2019s Possible Influence on William Halsted\u2019s Famous Radical Mastectomy","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":7096936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237983,"mean":12.377652561958,"rank":193689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237983,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":1.4081727574751,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.0857142857143,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/863335286255648768","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20105017],"posted_on":"2017-05-13T10:09:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"863335286255648768"}]}}
