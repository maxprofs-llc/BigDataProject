However, epidemiological studies are limited, especially regarding non-folate B-vitamins. Furthermore, few studies included quantitative assessment of supplemental intake. This prospective study aimed to investigate the associations between intakes of B-vitamins (dietary, supplemental, total) and breast cancer risk. 27,853 women aged \u226545 years from the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort (2009-2016) were included, with a median follow-up time of 4.2 years. Dietary data were collected using repeated 24 h records. A specific questionnaire assessed dietary supplement use over a 12-month period. A composition database of 8000 supplements was developed. Associations were characterized by multivariable Cox models, and 462 incident breast cancers were diagnosed. Dietary (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 0.74 (0.55, 0.99), P-trend = 0.05), supplemental (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 0.61 (0.38, 0.98), P-trend = 0.05), and total (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 0.67 (0.50, 0.91), P-trend = 0.01) pyridoxine intakes were inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Total thiamin intake was borderline inversely associated with breast cancer risk (HRper 1-unit increment = 0.78 (0.61, 1.00), P = 0.05). Statistically significant interactions between alcohol consumption and B-vitamin (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, folate, and cobalamin) supplemental intake were observed, the latter being inversely associated with breast cancer risk in non-to-low alcohol drinkers but not in higher drinkers. This large prospective study, including quantitative assessment of supplemental intake, suggests a potential protective effect of pyridoxine and thiamin on breast cancer risk in middle-aged women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6573cf058f610009228","authors":["Manon Egnell","Philippine Fassier","Lucie L\u00e9cuyer","Laurent Zelek","Marie-Paule Vasson","Serge Hercberg","Paule Latino-Martel","Pilar Galan","M\u00e9lanie Deschasaux","Mathilde Touvier"],"doi":"10.3390\/nu9050488","first_seen_on":"2017-05-13T07:23:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2072-6643"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nutrients","last_mentioned_on":1496444580,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/5\/488","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/5\/488?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28505069?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28505069\/?from=breast&i=18","http:\/\/mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/5\/488"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2072-6643\/9\/5\/488\/pdf","pmid":"28505069","pubdate":"2017-05-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"B-Vitamin Intake from Diet and Supplements and Breast Cancer Risk in Middle-Aged Women: Results from the Prospective NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Cohort","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bvitamin-intake-diet-supplements-breast-cancer-risk-middleaged-women-results-prospective-nutrinetsan-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.45,"score_history":{"1y":6.45,"6m":6.45,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":1326976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6977644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245094,"mean":12.41770186011,"rank":55000,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":189908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245094,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2640,"mean":14.769943918151,"rank":889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2640,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263,"mean":5.7572900763359,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HercbergS\/statuses\/863293625953857536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20102847],"posted_on":"2017-05-13T07:23:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Hercberg Serge","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/801048375722438656\/VJYYwQM9_normal.jpg","description":"Professeur de Nutrition, Facult\u00e9 M\u00e9decine Universit\u00e9 Paris 13,  Directeur Equipe de Recherche en Epid\u00e9miologie Nutritionnelle  (Inserm\/Inra\/Cnam\/UP13)","id_on_source":"HercbergS","tweeter_id":"2333109386","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":773},"tweet_id":"863293625953857536"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/863296556342038528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20102847],"posted_on":"2017-05-13T07:35:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/913708571468210177\/oIecAg-R_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
