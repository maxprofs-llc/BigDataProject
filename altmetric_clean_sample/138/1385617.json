The clinical importance of K+ is that surpluses or deficits in K+ in the extracellular fluid may predispose the patient to cardiac arrhythmias. The kidneys adjust overall K+ homeostasis by increasing or decreasing the rate of excretion of K+. Urinary excretion of K+ has 2 components: (i) the concentration of K+ in the tubular fluid that depends on the capacity of the cortical collecting duct to secrete K+. The capacity is determined by the lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference generated by the electrogenic reabsorption of Na+. Aldosterone and to a lesser degree HCO3- and Na+ in the tubular fluid are implicated in the generation of the potential difference. This component is evaluated by the transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG). (ii) The volume of fluid delivered to the cortical collecting duct that depends on the osmolar rate of excretion. These 2 components can be calculated if blood osmolality is higher than urine osmolality. Thus, investigating K+ abnormalities is based on the determination of TTKG and osmolar rate of excretion in the cortical collecting duct, on other clinical (extracellular fluid, blood pressure...) and biological data (24-hour K+ excretion, renin, aldosterone...) easily available. First treatment of K+ abnormality is the treatment of its cause. Insulin and glucose supply and dialysis are the best symptomatic treatments of hyperkalaemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008277","authors":["Dussol B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nephro.2010.03.004","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T19:40:08+00:00","issns":["1769-7255","17697255"],"issue":"3","journal":"N\u00e9phrologie & Th\u00e9rapeutique","last_mentioned_on":1365943594,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1769725510000520"],"pmid":"20399166","pubdate":"2010-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nephrology"],"title":"\u00c9quilibre potassique, hypokali\u00e9mie et hyperkali\u00e9mie ","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quilibre-potassique-hypokalimie-et-hyperkalimie"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":2899087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85552,"mean":6.5053440871528,"rank":65965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85552,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.3001025641026,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.6,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"ML":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Elsevier: Article Locator","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=356173781169606&id=179186882128602","license":"public","citation_ids":[1385617],"posted_on":"2013-04-14T12:46:34+00:00","summary":"svp j'ai besoin de cet article\nhttp:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1769725510000520","author":{"name":"Lafrikh Youness","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/179186882128602","facebook_wall_name":"\u00c9change d'articles et publications scientifiques","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/179186882128602\/picture","id_on_source":"179186882128602"}}]}}
