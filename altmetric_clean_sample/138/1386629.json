The neuraminidase (NA) stalk region of influenza virus varies considerably and may associate with its virulence. The NA stalk region of all N1 subtype influenza A viruses can be divided into six different stalk-motifs, H5N1\/2004-like (NA-wt), WSN-like, H5N1\/97-like, PR\/8-like, H7N1\/99-like and H5N1\/96-like. The NA-wt is a special NA stalk-motif which was first observed in H5N1 influenza virus in 2000, with a 20-amino acid deletion in the 49(th) to 68(th) positions of the stalk region. Here we show that there is a gradual increase of the special NA stalk-motif in H5N1 isolates from 2000 to 2007, and notably, the special stalk-motif is observed in all 173 H5N1 human isolates from 2004 to 2007. The recombinant H5N1 virus with the special stalk-motif possesses the highest virulence and pathogenicity in chicken and mice, while the recombinant viruses with the other stalk-motifs display attenuated phenotype. This indicates that the special stalk-motif has contributed to the high virulence and pathogenicity of H5N1 isolates since 2000. The gradually increasing emergence of the special NA stalk-motif in H5N1 isolates, especially in human isolates, deserves attention by all.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009PLoSO...4.6277Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Hongbo Zhou","Zhengjun Yu","Yong Hu","Jiagang Tu","Wei Zou","Yaping Peng","Jiping Zhu","Yongtao Li","Anding Zhang","Ziniu Yu","Zhiping Ye","Huanchun Chen","Meilin Jin"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0006277","first_seen_on":"2013-04-15T01:24:29+00:00","issns":["","1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1248786014,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0006277"],"pmcid":"PMC2707603","pmid":"19609439","pubdate":"2009-07-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Special Neuraminidase Stalk-Motif Responsible for Increased Virulence and Pathogenesis of H5N1 Influenza A Virus","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/special-neuraminidase-stalkmotif-responsible-increased-virulence-pathogenesis-h5n1-influenza-virus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":327845,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3276355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85272,"mean":6.5284102215291,"rank":10237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":74769,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85272,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64103,"mean":8.2759017815358,"rank":9240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":54705,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64103,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4207,"mean":7.6621046124584,"rank":566,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4207,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
