As a result birthrates in the United States have dropped sharply, and some men never make the transition into parenthood. Using data from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, this study examines the characteristics of childless men in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 (N = 6,168) and whether these men want to have a child sometime in the future. Our main finding is that the majority of childless men want a child someday; however, by the age of 45 more than 1 in 7 still remain childless.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006981","authors":["Lawrence M.
