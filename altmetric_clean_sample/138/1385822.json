The metric was measured in 4 patients who demonstrated this phenomenon and in the aorta of 10 patients with no clinical sign suggestive of slow flow. Future studies are needed to validate the relationship between gravitational gradient, slow flow, and patient outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0f","doi":"10.1097\/rct.0b013e31827bc476","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T20:55:56+00:00","issns":["0363-8715"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography","last_mentioned_on":1365972894,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcat\/Abstract\/2013\/04000\/Computed_Tomography_Angiography_Gravitational.26.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcat\/2013\/04000\/Computed_Tomography_Angiography_Gravitational.26.pdf","pmid":"23493223","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"297","subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Computed Tomography Angiography Gravitational Gradient as an Imaging Sign of Slow Flow","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computed-tomography-angiography-gravitational-gradient-imaging-sign-slow-flow"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2933528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1429089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89376,"mean":6.7755894377623,"rank":57548,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":28773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89376,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":914,"mean":1.0252464403067,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":914,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JCATonline\/statuses\/323539859073536003","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[1385822],"posted_on":"2013-04-14T20:54:48+00:00","author":{"name":"JCAT Online","url":"http:\/\/www.jcomputertomography.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1463523302\/JCATtwitter_normal.jpg","description":"The Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography provides readers with the latest clinical and research developments in computer-based diagnostic imaging.","id_on_source":"JCATonline","tweeter_id":"342947823","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":28},"tweet_id":"323539859073536003"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Computed Tomography Angiography Gravitational Gradient as an... : Journal of Computer Assisted Tomog","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=585972311427992&id=235683983131632","license":"public","citation_ids":[1385822],"posted_on":"2013-04-14T20:54:54+00:00","summary":"New Article:","author":{"name":"The Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/235683983131632","facebook_wall_name":"The Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/235683983131632\/picture","id_on_source":"235683983131632"}}]}}
