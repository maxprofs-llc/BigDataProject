Travel medicine is a new medical discipline that quantifies these health risks and develops strategies for reducing them. Obtaining health and evacuation insurance for a future trip is important for persons with medical conditions, those planning trips to developing tropical or semi-tropical regions of the world or when an international stay anywhere will be as long as a month. Pre-travel medical evaluation, vaccines against endemic infectious diseases and medications to reduce the occurrence of diarrhea and malaria during trips to endemic areas, and medications for self-treatment of common illnesses such as diarrhea are fundamental to travel medicine. There are a number of miscellaneous areas to consider in travel medicine including preventing deep vein thrombosis and minimizing jet lag during long haul air travel and reducing the occurrence of accidents and water- and altitude-related illnesses. An important recently defined challenge to the field is the growing number of ill-prepared persons put at great risk for illness while visiting friends and relatives living in areas of reduced hygiene. All persons need to have an idea of how and where they may find medical care if they develop illness while abroad. This article summarizes essential elements in travel medicine and offers 10 recommendations for safe travel.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc89","authors":["DuPont HL"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-13T16:55:21+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association","last_mentioned_on":1281224452,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18596858"],"pmcid":"PMC2394696","pmid":"18596858","pubdate":"2008-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Clinical and Climatological Association","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"President's address: travel medicine and principles of safe travel.","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/presidents-address-travel-medicine-principles-safe-travel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.184,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.184},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9072834051191,"rank":440307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3243891,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85764,"mean":6.4448814756947,"rank":12446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":73316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85764,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":3.1743368421053,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":4.411,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
