She had developed constipation that had led to ileus and had received 34 g of magnesium citrate (Magcolol P) orally the day before. She was lethargic, her blood pressure was less than 50 mmHg, and electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm. Her serum concentration of magnesium (Mg) was markedly elevated (16.6 mg\/dl =13.7 mEq\/l). Emergency colonoscopy revealed ischemic colitis. As her condition ameliorated, her renal function returned to normal. Hence, the present case suggests that severe hypermagnesemia can occur in the absence of pre-existing renal dysfunction in elderly patients with gastrointestinal diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077d5","authors":["Kontani M","Hara A","Ohta S","Ikeda T"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-13T18:14:26+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1289973655,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15942092"],"pmid":"15942092","pubdate":"2005-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Hypermagnesemia induced by massive cathartic ingestion in an elderly woman without pre-existing renal dysfunction.","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypermagnesemia-induced-massive-cathartic-ingestion-elderly-woman-without-preexisting-renal-dysfunct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.712,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.712},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4249983,"mean":5.1322894703445,"rank":568006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3681986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4249983,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88053,"mean":6.6125225548539,"rank":13967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":74086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88053,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":615,"mean":1.8294299674267,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":615,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":1.1166666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":5,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Chemistry":1,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Computer Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Magia reklamy suplement\u00f3w diety \u2013 magnez","url":"http:\/\/feedproxy.google.com\/~r\/badania\/net\/~3\/ECFXJ8q1BiQ\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[1381760],"posted_on":"2010-11-17T06:00:55+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"badania.net","url":"http:\/\/badania.net\/","description":"je\u015bli chcesz wiedzie\u0107 wi\u0119cej"}}]}}
