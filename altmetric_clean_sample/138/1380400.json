While several cell cycle regulators have been shown to be important in this process, a role for the tumor suppressor, p53, has not been demonstrated. Here, we investigated a role for p53 in limiting the ability of M\u00fcller glia to proliferate in the mature mouse retina. Our data demonstrate that M\u00fcller glia undergo a developmental restriction in their potential to proliferate. Retinal explants or dissociated cultures treated with EGF become mitotically quiescent by the end of the second postnatal week. In contrast, M\u00fcller glia from adult trp53-\/+ or trp53-\/- mice displayed a greater ability to proliferate in response to EGF stimulation in vitro. The enhanced proliferative ability of trp53 deficient mice correlates with a decreased expression of the mitotic inhibitor Cdkn1a\/p21(cip) and an increase in c-myc, a transcription factor that promotes cell cycle progression. These data show that p53 plays an essential role in limiting the potential of M\u00fcller glia to re-enter the mitotic cycle as the retina matures during postnatal development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007579","authors":["Ueki, Yumi","Karl, Mike O.","Sudar, Samuel","Pollak, Julia","Taylor, Russell J.","Loeffler, Kati","Wilken, Matthew S.","Reardon, Sara","Reh, Thomas A."],"doi":"10.1002\/glia.22377","endpage":"1589","first_seen_on":"2013-04-13T13:19:19+00:00","issns":["1098-1136","0894-1491"],"issue":"10","journal":"Glia","last_mentioned_on":1341604574,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/glia.22377&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/glia.22377\/pdf","pmid":"22777914","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1579","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"P53 is required for the developmental restriction in Mller glial proliferation in mouse retina","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/p53-required-developmental-restriction-m%C3%BCller-glial-proliferation-mouse-retina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635017,"mean":4.9194226118571,"rank":2899271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635017,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85533,"mean":6.4826789038022,"rank":65937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":453,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85533,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":2.1874738878143,"rank":415,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":18.643333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
