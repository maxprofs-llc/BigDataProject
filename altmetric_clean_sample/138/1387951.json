It makes a foundation for preserving good relationships between patients, doctors and other healthcare staffs. Third Edition of national PBR was published in Iran in 2009. On the other hand, developing national wide Electronic Health Records (EHR) is now one of the strategic goals of Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. EHR as a basic repository for all related information provides access to the necessary data to organize, store and manage them. It also makes an additional support to the legal aspects of healthcare services, increases staff information about patient rights, and raises them to respect these rights. This article reviews how EHR standards can help to institutionalize the PBR.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f6100037f2","authors":["Abbasi S","Ferdosi M"],"doi":"10.5455\/aim.2012.21.20-22","first_seen_on":"2013-04-15T11:14:54+00:00","issns":["0353-8109"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta Informatica Medica","last_mentioned_on":1366024430,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23572856"],"pmcid":"PMC3610580","pmid":"23572856","pubdate":"2013-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Do electronic health records standards help implementing patient bill of rights in hospitals?","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electronic-health-records-standards-help-implementing-patient-bill-rights-hospitals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
