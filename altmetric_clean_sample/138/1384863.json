In total, 8 diabetic ZDF fatty animals and 8 age-matched control ZDF lean rats were employed in the study. C8-T5 dorsal root ganglia were isolated bilaterally from 14 to 18 weeks old rats, and a primary culture was prepared. Calcium activity was measured ratiometrically using the fluorescent Ca(2+)-indicator Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. All neurons were stimulated twice with 20\u2009mM\u2009K(+), followed by stimulation with either 0.3 or 0.5\u2009 \u03bc M Capsaicin, alone or in combination with algogenic chemicals (bradykinin, serotonin, prostaglandin E2 (all 10(-5)\u2009M), and adenosine (10(-3)\u2009M)) at pH 7.4 and 6.0. Neurons from diabetic animals exhibited an overall increased response to stimulation with 20\u2009mM\u2009K(+) compared to neurons from control. Stimulation with Capsaicin alone caused an augmented response in neurons from diabetic animals compared to control animals. When stimulated with a combination of Capsaicin and algogenic chemicals, no differences between the two groups of neurons were measured, neither at pH 7.4 nor 6.0. In conclusion, diabetes-induced alterations in calcium activity of the DRG neurons were found, potentially indicating altered neuronal responses during myocardial ischemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e33","authors":["Ghorbani, Marie Louise"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/532850","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T14:59:24+00:00","issns":["1687-8337"],"journal":"International Journal of Endocrinology","last_mentioned_on":1365951501,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ije\/2013\/532850\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ije\/2013\/532850.pdf","pmid":"23662103","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","title":"Calcium Activity of Upper Thoracic Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calcium-activity-upper-thoracic-dorsal-root-ganglion-neurons-zucker-diabetic-fatty-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2904524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85469,"mean":6.544763069219,"rank":66159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85469,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262,"mean":2.4267203065134,"rank":181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
