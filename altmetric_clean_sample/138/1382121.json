To assess the function of GFAP, we created GFAP-null mice using gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. The GFAP-null mice have normal development and fertility, and show no gross alterations in behavior or CNS morphology. Astrocytes are present in the CNS of the mutant mice, but contain a severely reduced number of intermediate filaments. Since astrocyte processes contact synapses and may modulate synaptic function, we examined whether the GFAP-null mice were altered in long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The GFAP-null mice displayed enhanced long-term potentiation of both population spike amplitude and excitatory post-synaptic potential slope compared to control mice. These data suggest that GFAP is important for astrocyte-neuronal interactions, and that astrocyte processes play a vital role in modulating synaptic efficacy in the CNS. These mice therefore represent a direct demonstration that a primary defect in astrocytes influences neuronal physiology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["M A McCall","R G Gregg","R R Behringer","M Brenner","C L Delaney","E J Galbreath","C L Zhang","R A Pearce","S Y Chiu","A Messing"],"first_seen_on":"2013-04-13T19:30:12+00:00","issns":["1091-6490","0027-8424"],"issue":"13","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1365783153,"links":["http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/13\/6361.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/93\/13\/6361.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC39027","pmid":"8692820","pubdate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Acad Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Targeted deletion in astrocyte intermediate filament (Gfap) alters neuronal physiology","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/targeted-deletion-astrocyte-intermediate-filament-gfap-alters-neuronal-physiology"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":2905715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":74583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85481,"mean":6.5230689284044,"rank":66196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33577,"mean":13.659922385037,"rank":30324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33577,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":947,"mean":22.423543340381,"rank":850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":947,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
