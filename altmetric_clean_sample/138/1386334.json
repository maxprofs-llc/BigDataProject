A novel method for routine, high-yield no-carrier-added synthesis of [(124)I]-, [(125)I]- and [(131)I]-6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-(4-iodophenylamino)-8-methyl-8H-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one has been developed. The 4'-trimethylstannyl- or 4'-tri-n-butylstannyl-pyridopyrimidinone precursors were prepared from the aryl bromide via a palladium-mediated coupling with hexaalkylditin (dioxane\/microwave irradiation\/10 min at 160 degrees C). The radioiodination of 4'-stannylpyridopyrimidinones was found to optimally occur via an iododestannylation with Na(124)I, Na(125)I or Na(131)I in the presence of an oxidant [30% H(2)O(2)\/HOAc (1:3)\/10 min] in 79-87% radiochemical yield with >99% radiochemical purity. The total radiosynthesis time was 30 min. The 4-iodophenylpyridopyrimidinone 2 inhibited recombinant Abl kinase activity with an IC(50) of 2.0 nM. Cell proliferation of K562 and A431 cells was inhibited with an IC(50) of 2.0 and 20 nM, respectively. Rapid cellular uptake and equilibrium were observed within 10-15 min using [(131)I]-4-iodophenylpyridopyrimidinone 6c in K562 and A431 cells and demonstrated a 2.8-fold uptake selectivity for the Bcr-Abl-expressing K562 cells at 60 min. These results suggest that pyridopyrimidinone radiotracers may be useful in imaging Abl-, Bcr-Abl- or Src-expressing malignancies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f6100031fb","authors":["Veach DR","Namavari M","Beresten T","Balatoni J","Minchenko M","Djaballah H","Finn RD","Clarkson B","Gelovani JG","Bornmann WG","Larson SM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nucmedbio.2005.01.008","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T23:35:19+00:00","issns":["0969-8051"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nuclear Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1301595842,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15878500?dopt=Citation"],"pmid":"15878500","pubdate":"2005-05-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Synthesis and in vitro examination of [124I]-, [125I]- and [131I]-2-(4-iodophenylamino) pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-one radiolabeled Abl kinase inhibitors.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-vitro-examination-124i-125i-131i24iodophenylamino-pyrido23dpyrimidin7one-radiolabeled-abl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.032,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.032},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685110,"mean":4.9302723403875,"rank":603291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3080480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685110,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85785,"mean":6.4748066306071,"rank":16083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85785,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":0.83692592592593,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
