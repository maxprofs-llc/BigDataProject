To date the expected deluge of new drugs has not arrived. However, a small number of drugs arising directly from the study of rare human disorders showing Mendelian inheritance are now entering late stage clinical trials. Here we describe the advantages of this approach and discuss the background and early clinical trial findings with antibodies directed at a target identified in this way.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002734","doi":"10.1016\/j.drudis.2013.04.001","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T11:05:39+00:00","issns":["1878-5832"],"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","last_mentioned_on":1365937367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23579167?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23579167","pubdate":"2013-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Sclerostin: How human mutations have helped reveal a new target for the treatment of osteoporosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sclerostin-human-mutations-helped-reveal-new-target-treatment-osteoporosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3076991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":955770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89375,"mean":6.7790001118895,"rank":60430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89375,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":666,"mean":4.0721503759399,"rank":481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":666,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":5.4045,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
