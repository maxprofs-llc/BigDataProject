Forty GK rats either remained sedentary (SED), performed ET, received SEL, (5 \u00b5mol\u00b7kg body wt(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or underwent both ET and SEL treatment for 6 wk. ET alone, SEL alone, or COMBI resulted in a significant lowering of lactate, glucose, and insulin levels as well as a reduction in HOMA-IR and AUC for glucose relative to SED. Additionally, ET alone, SEL alone, or COMBI increased glycogen content and citrate synthase (CS) activities in liver and muscles. However, their effects on glycogen content and CS activity were tissue-specific. In particular, ET alone, SEL alone, or COMBI induced upregulation of glucose (AMPK, PGC-1\u03b1, GLUT-4) and lactate (LDH, MCT-1, MCT-4, COX-IV) metabolic proteins relative to SED. However, their effects on glucose and lactate metabolic proteins also appeared to be tissue-specific. It seemed that glucose and lactate metabolic protein expression was not further enhanced with COMBI compared to that of ET alone or SEL alone. These data suggest that ET alone or SEL alone or COMBI represent a practical strategy for ameliorating aberrant expression of glucose and lactate metabolic proteins in diabetic GK rats.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6d","authors":["Seung-Suk Kim","Jung-Hoon Koo","In-Su Kwon","Yoo-Sung Oh","Sun-Jang Lee","Eung Joon Kim","Won-Kyu Kim","Jin Lee","Joon-Yong Cho"],"doi":"10.4162\/nrp.2011.5.3.205","first_seen_on":"2013-04-14T19:27:51+00:00","issns":["1976-1457"],"issue":"3","journal":"Nutrition Research and Practice","last_mentioned_on":1365967608,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3133752\/"],"pmid":"21779523","pubdate":"2011-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Korean Society of Community Nutrition and the Korean Nutrition Society","startpage":"205","title":"Exercise training and selenium or a combined treatment ameliorates aberrant expression of glucose and lactate metabolic proteins in skeletal muscle in a rodent model of diabetes","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-training-selenium-combined-treatment-ameliorates-aberrant-expression-glucose-lactate-metabo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630815,"mean":4.9285062716012,"rank":2015483,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630815,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85518,"mean":6.5175257083388,"rank":43847,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":26321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85518,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":2.7602258064516,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.287,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
