Decades of research and new-generation sequencing provided functional information on key genes and transcripts. However, there is less information available on how differential gene expression translates into the domains of functionally important proteins, peptides, and metabolites, and how changes in these molecules impact development. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the current technology of choice for the detection and quantification of large numbers of proteins and metabolites, because it requires no use of antibodies, functional probes, or a priori knowledge of molecules produced in the system. This review focuses on recent technologies that have improved MS sensitivity for proteins and metabolites and enabled new functionalities to assess their temporal and spatial changes during vertebrate embryonic development. This review highlights case studies, in which new-generation MS tools have enabled the study of hundreds-to-thousands of proteins and metabolites in tissues, cell populations, and single cells in model systems of vertebrate development, particularly the frog (Xenopus), zebrafish, and mouse. New-generation MS expands the toolbox of cell and developmental studies, raising exciting potentials to advance basic and translational research in the life sciences.
