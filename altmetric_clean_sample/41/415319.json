Adhesion molecules are normally harbored within the glycocalyx, clothing every healthy vascular endothelium, but shed by ischemia\/reperfusion. Our aim was to show whether protection of the glycocalyx with either hydrocortisone or antithrombin can reduce postischemic leukocyte adhesion. Isolated guinea pig hearts, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, were subjected to 20 min of warm (37 degrees C) no-flow ischemia and consecutive 10 min of reperfusion, either in the absence or presence of hydrocortisone (10 microg\/mL) or antithrombin (1 U\/mL). An intracoronary bolus of 3 x 10 PMN was applied at the end of reperfusion but without prior contact to the drugs. The sequestration of PMN was calculated from the difference between coronary input and output of cells. Expression of the integrin CD11b on PMN was measured before and after coronary passage. Ischemia\/reperfusion induced severe degradation of the glycocalyx (coronary venous syndecan-1 release, 171 +\/- 15 ng\/g heart vs. basal, 19 +\/- 2 ng\/g; heparan sulfate, 5.27 +\/- 0.28 microg\/g vs. basal, 0.26 +\/- 0.06 microg\/g) and increased PMN adhesion (38.1% +\/- 3.5% vs. basal, 11.7% +\/- 3.1%). Hydrocortisone and antithrombin both not only reduced glycocalyx shedding (syndecan-1 release, 34 +\/- 6 ng\/g and 26 +\/- 5 ng\/g; heparan sulfate, 1.96 +\/- 0.24 microg\/g and 1.28 +\/- 0.2 microg\/g, respectively), but also PMN adhesion (17.3% +\/- 2.2% and 25.4% +\/- 3.3%, respectively) after ischemia\/reperfusion. Electron microscopy revealed a mostly intact coronary glycocalyx after pretreatment with either drug. Activation of PMN upon coronary passage was not influenced. Preservation of the glycocalyx mitigates postischemic PMN adhesion. Preconditioning with either hydrocortisone or antithrombin should, thus, alleviate vascular leakage, tissue edema, and inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008925","doi":"10.1097\/shk.0b013e3181cdc363","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T09:16:57+00:00","issns":["1073-2322"],"issue":"2","journal":"Shock","last_mentioned_on":1336539951,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Fulltext\/2010\/08000\/Glycocalyx_Protection_Reduces_Leukocyte_Adhesion.5.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/2010\/08000\/Glycocalyx_Protection_Reduces_Leukocyte_Adhesion.5.pdf","pmid":"20634656","pubdate":"2010-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"133","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"GLYCOCALYX PROTECTION REDUCES LEUKOCYTE ADHESION AFTER ISCHEMIA\/REPERFUSION","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/glycocalyx-protection-reduces-leukocyte-adhesion-after-ischemiareperfusion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770902,"mean":5.7220129992239,"rank":2533726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1587606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770902,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70311,"mean":4.4992752951216,"rank":30426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":27836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70311,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1408,"mean":1.2775820895522,"rank":293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1408,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":1.0028888888889,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
