We investigated the association of multiple variables and OH. This is a cross-sectional study of prevalent hemodialysis patients examining the predialysis hydrational status with a portable bioimpedance apparatus to measure the degree of hydration. We completed our study in 79 patients. Patients were overhydrated by 2.6 \u00b1 2.4 L. The mean medication count was 2.4 \u00b1 1.5, and 50.7% had diuretics. We found a significant correlation between OH and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.39; p = 0.0006), each liter of OH generating 3.6 mm Hg. We also found a positive correlation between the use of diuretics and OH (p = 0.003, two-tailed Student's t test) but no correlation between OH and body weight (r < 0.0001; p = 0.99), body mass index (r = -0.17), age (r = 0.089), and vintage (r = 0.05). For every 10% increase in body fat, OH decreased by 1.2 L; residual urine output gave no protection from OH (r = 0.077) and did not correlate with blood pressure (r = 0.01). Overhydration is strongly associated with the use of antihypertensive medications and the use of diuretics in this dialysis population. Obesity seems to afford some protection from OH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b3a","doi":"10.1097\/mat.0b013e3182377216","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T09:13:49+00:00","issns":["1058-2916"],"issue":"","journal":"ASAIO Journal: A Peer-Reviewed Journal of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs","last_mentioned_on":1339995768,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/9000\/00000\/Dialysis_Patients__Fluid_Overload,.99754.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/Abstract\/2011\/11000\/Dialysis_Patients__Fluid_Overload,.6.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/9000\/00000\/Dialysis_Patients__Fluid_Overload,.99754.pdf","pmid":"21989422","pubdate":"2011-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"","title":"Dialysis Patients' Fluid Overload, Antihypertensive Medications, and Obesity","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dialysis-patients-fluid-overload-antihypertensive-medications-obesity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":2672564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71510,"mean":4.5777969206673,"rank":31278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71510,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":431,"mean":1.1454186046512,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":431,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.69230769230769,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
