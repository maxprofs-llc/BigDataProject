This method is highly site selective and general, as it allows for oxygenation of not only electron-neutral but also electron-poor phenols. This method operates via a silanol-directed acetoxylation, followed by a subsequent acid-catalyzed cyclization reaction into a cyclic silicon-protected catechol. A routine desilylation of the silacyle with TBAF uncovers the catechol product.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Chunhui Huang","Nugzar Ghavtadze","Buddhadeb Chattopadhyay","Vladimir Gevorgyan"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja208572v","first_seen_on":"2011-10-19T02:44:50+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1319728080,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja208572v","http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/suppl\/10.1021\/ja208572v"],"pmid":"21999512","pubdate":"2011-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"111018141151004","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of Catechols from Phenols via Pd-Catalyzed Silanol-Directed C\u2013H Oxygenation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-catechols-phenols-via-pdcatalyzed-silanoldirected-ch-oxygenation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.624,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.624},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5040289,"mean":5.9643426109799,"rank":414585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4624937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5040289,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71372,"mean":4.5753849602779,"rank":5333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":66037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71372,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15536,"mean":4.5775540392662,"rank":1097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":14433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15536,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":4.9878171091445,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
