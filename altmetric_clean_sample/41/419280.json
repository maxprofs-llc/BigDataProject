Furthermore, there is evidence implying that locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system activity impairs attempts to solve anagrams. Consistent with these ideas, we found that subjects solved anagrams significantly faster when supine than when standing. With anagrams characterized as insight problems, our finding suggests that insight may be influenced by body posture.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000258c","authors":["Lipnicki DM","Byrne DG","Darren M.
