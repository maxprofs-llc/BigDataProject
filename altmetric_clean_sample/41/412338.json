Data was gathered from 437 university students. The results indicated that factors such as gender, level of psychological symptoms, connecting to the Internet most often at night, and using the Internet primarily to communicate with their relatives and friends and to have a good time predicted significantly the level of the problematic Internet use of the students. Moreover, the predictors differentiated in terms of the domains of the problematic Internet use.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c0","authors":["A.
