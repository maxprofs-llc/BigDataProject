To define functional differences between the three mammalian SREBPs we used genome-wide ChIP-seq with isoform-specific antibodies and chromatin from select tissues of mice challenged with different dietary conditions that enrich for specific SREBPs. We show that hepatic SREBP-2 binds preferentially to two different gene-proximal motifs. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis suggests SREBP-2 targets lipid metabolic processes as expected, but apoptosis and autophagy gene categories were also enriched. We show that SREBP-2 directly activates autophagy genes during cell-sterol depletion, conditions known to induce both autophagy and nuclear SREBP-2 levels. Additionally, SREBP-2 knockdown during nutrient depletion decreased autophagosome formation and lipid droplet association of the autophagosome targeting protein LC3. Thus, the lipid droplet could be viewed as a third source of cellular cholesterol, which along with sterol synthesis and uptake, is also regulated by SREBP-2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","doi":"10.1016\/j.cmet.2011.03.005","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T04:24:25+00:00","funders":["phs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1932-7420"],"issue":"4","journal":"Cell Metabolism (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1304467200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21459322"],"pmid":"21459322","pubdate":"2011-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Genome-wide localization of SREBP-2 in hepatic chromatin predicts a role in autophagy.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-localization-srebp2-hepatic-chromatin-predicts-role-autophagy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.112,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.112},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":501330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3184257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66689,"mean":3.799734974808,"rank":8081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":58607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66689,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":910,"mean":13.277311331133,"rank":311,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":910,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":4.8198095238095,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Researcher":41,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
