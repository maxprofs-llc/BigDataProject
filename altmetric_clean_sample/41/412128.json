Event-related changes in zygomaticus major, corrugator supercilii, and orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity and skin conductance level (SCL) were recorded, and the participants rated their emotions and the trait psychoticism based on the Psychoticism dimension of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire--Revised, Short Form. Wounding and killing the opponent elicited an increase in SCL and a decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity. The decrease in zygomatic and orbicularis oculi activity was less pronounced among high Psychoticism scorers compared with low Psychoticism scorers. The wounding and death of the player's own character (James Bond) elicited an increase in SCL and zygomatic and orbicularis oculi EMG activity and a decrease in corrugator activity. Instead of joy resulting from victory and success, wounding and killing the opponent may elicit high-arousal negative affect (anxiety), with high Psychoticism scorers experiencing less anxiety than low Psychoticism scorers. Although counterintuitive, the wounding and death of the player's own character may increase some aspect of positive emotion.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67b3cf058f610009798","authors":["Niklas Ravaja","Marko Turpeinen","Timo Saari","Sampsa Puttonen","Liisa Keltikangas-J\u00e4rvinen"],"doi":"10.1037\/1528-3542.8.1.114","endpage":"120","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T04:36:09+00:00","issns":["1528-3542","1931-1516","1528-3542 (Print)"],"issue":"1","journal":"Emotion","last_mentioned_on":1473458668,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1037\/1528-3542.8.1.114","https:\/\/my.apa.org\/apa\/idm\/login.seam?ERIGHTS_TARGET=http%3A%2F%2Fpsycnet.apa.org%2Fjournals%2Femo%2F8%2F1%2F114%2F&AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED=true","http:\/\/content.apa.org\/journals\/emo\/8\/1\/114"],"pmid":"18266521","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Psychological Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"114","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The psychophysiology of James Bond: Phasic emotional responses to violent video game events.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychophysiology-james-bond-phasic-emotional-responses-violent-video-game-events"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.658,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.658},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":633704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7718703,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86132,"mean":5.3351885383892,"rank":5920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":80212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86132,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1386,"mean":8.9930844765343,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":1211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1386,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":7.0092,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
