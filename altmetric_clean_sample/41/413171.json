To date, few variants associated with interindividual blood pressure variation have been identified and replicated. Here we report results of a genome-wide association study of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and hypertension in the CHARGE Consortium (n = 29,136), identifying 13 SNPs for SBP, 20 for DBP and 10 for hypertension at P < 4 \u00d7 10(-7). The top ten loci for SBP and DBP were incorporated into a risk score; mean BP and prevalence of hypertension increased in relation to the number of risk alleles carried. When ten CHARGE SNPs for each trait were included in a joint meta-analysis with the Global BPgen Consortium (n = 34,433), four CHARGE loci attained genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) for SBP (ATP2B1, CYP17A1, PLEKHA7, SH2B3), six for DBP (ATP2B1, CACNB2, CSK-ULK3, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4) and one for hypertension (ATP2B1). Identifying genes associated with blood pressure advances our understanding of blood pressure regulation and highlights potential drug targets for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003164","authors":["Daniel Levy","Georg B Ehret","Kenneth Rice","Germaine C Verwoert","Lenore J Launer","Abbas Dehghan","Nicole L Glazer","Alanna C Morrison","Andrew D Johnson","Thor Aspelund","Yurii Aulchenko","Thomas Lumley","Anna K|[ouml]|ttgen","Ramachandran S Vasan","Fernando Rivadeneira","Gudny Eiriksdottir","Xiuqing Guo","Dan E Arking","Gary F Mitchell","Francesco U S Mattace-Raso","Albert V Smith","Kent Taylor","Robert B Scharpf","Shih-Jen Hwang","Eric J G Sijbrands","Joshua Bis","Tamara B Harris","Santhi K Ganesh","Christopher J O'Donnell","Albert Hofman","Jerome I Rotter","Josef Coresh","Emelia J Benjamin","Andr|[eacute]| G Uitterlinden","Gerardo Heiss","Caroline S Fox","Jacqueline C M Witteman","Eric Boerwinkle","Thomas J Wang","Vilmundur Gudnason","Martin G Larson","Aravinda Chakravarti","Bruce M Psaty","Cornelia M van Duijn","Levy D","Ehret GB","Rice K","Verwoert GC","Launer LJ","Dehghan A","Glazer NL","Morrison AC","Johnson AD","Aspelund T","Aulchenko Y","Lumley T","K\u00f6ttgen A","Vasan RS","Rivadeneira F","Eiriksdottir G","Guo X","Arking DE","Mitchell GF","Mattace-Raso FU","Smith AV","Taylor K","Scharpf RB","Hwang SJ","Sijbrands EJ","Bis J","Harris TB","Ganesh SK","O'Donnell CJ","Hofman A","Rotter JI","Coresh J","Benjamin EJ","Uitterlinden AG","Heiss G","Fox CS","Witteman JC","Boerwinkle E","Wang TJ","Gudnason V","Larson MG","Chakravarti A","Psaty BM","van Duijn CM","Anna K\u00f6ttgen","Andr\u00e9 G Uitterlinden"],"doi":"10.1038\/ng.384","endpage":"687","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T06:25:54+00:00","issns":["1061-4036","1546-1718"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nature Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1448544839,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/ng.384.html","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ng.384","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19430479","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ng\/journal\/v41\/n6\/full\/ng.384.html"],"pmcid":"PMC2998712","pmid":"19430479","pubdate":"2009-05-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"677","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Genome-wide association study of blood pressure and hypertension.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ng.384","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genomewide-association-study-blood-pressure-hypertension-13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":34.578,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":34.578},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6611727,"mean":6.131580845607,"rank":183505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":6428339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6611727,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75581,"mean":4.9137285789891,"rank":1692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":73889,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75581,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4123,"mean":21.886649199418,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4123,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":8.9578701298701,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":14,"Researcher":42,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Student  > Ph.
