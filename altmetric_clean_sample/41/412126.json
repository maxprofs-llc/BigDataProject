In earlier studies on mice with PKU (ENU(2)\/ENU(2)), LNAAs were given and a surprising decline in blood Phe concentrations was observed. The formula used in the mouse experiment (PreKUnil) lacked lysine. Therefore, a new formulation of LNAAs (NeoPhe) was developed, introducing changes in the concentration of some amino acids and adding lysine, so that such a mixture could be used in humans. The new formula was found to be effective in reducing blood Phe concentration in mice by about 50% of the elevated levels. Patients with PKU were given LNAAs and blood Phe concentrations were determined in an open-label study. Three centers--in Russia, the Ukraine and the USA--took part in the study. NeoPhe was given at 0.5 g\/kg per day in three divided doses to eight subjects with PKU and at 1.0 g\/kg per day to three patients, for one week. The NeoPhe resulted in decrease of elevated blood Phe by 50% in both groups. The preliminary data from this study are encouraging and a double blind placebo-controlled trial will be required to show long-term efficacy and tolerance of LNAAs in the treatment of PKU.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cda","authors":["R.
