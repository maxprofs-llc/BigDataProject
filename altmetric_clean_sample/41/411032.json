A temporal increase in the incidence of sporotrichosis in a dermatology practice at a military installation in southwestern Oklahoma prompted an investigation. Patients with sporotrichosis presenting to a single dermatologist in the winter of 1992-1993 were interviewed, epidemiological data were collected, and fungal cultures were obtained from incriminated hay fields. Five patients presented with cutaneous sporotrichosis during a 5-week period beginning in December 1992. Four patients had maintained hay bales in a Halloween haunted house and the fifth patient had visited the house once. As in 3 previous reports, this outbreak was associated with stored hay or hay bales harvested in the US plains states. Contact with hay should be recognized as a risk factor for infection with Sporothrix schenckii. Outbreaks are possible given adequate intensity of exposure and may be difficult to recognize because of the delayed presentation of clinical illness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002307","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T02:55:56+00:00","issns":["0003-9926"],"issue":"16","journal":"Archives of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1320069600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9290549"],"pmid":"9290549","pubdate":"1997-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Spook house sporotrichosis.
