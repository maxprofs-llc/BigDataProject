'Validated' and professionally endorsed generic measures are widely used to evaluate critical care intervention and guide practice, policy and research. Although recognizing that they are 'here to stay', leading QoL researchers are beginning to question their 'fitness for purpose'. It is therefore timely to review critiques of their limitations in the wider healthcare and social science literatures and to examine the implications for critical care research including, in particular, emerging interventional studies in which HRQoL is the primary outcome of interest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000706b","doi":"10.1097\/mcc.0b013e32834a4bd4","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T09:28:32+00:00","issns":["1070-5295"],"issue":"5","journal":"Current Opinion in Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1318097233,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/Abstract\/2011\/10000\/Health_related_quality_of_life___implications_for.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-criticalcare\/2011\/10000\/Health_related_quality_of_life___implications_for.15.pdf","pmid":"21900770","pubdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"510","subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"Health-related quality of life: implications for critical care interventional studies and why we need to collaborate with patients","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/healthrelated-quality-life-12"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770903,"mean":5.7215656817113,"rank":2533680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1588012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770903,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70312,"mean":4.4980031005105,"rank":30413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":27949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70312,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":2.9762839879154,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.812,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/CO_CriticalCare\/status\/122734808802672640","citation_ids":[416248],"posted_on":"2011-10-08T18:07:13+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"CO_CriticalCare","tweeter_id":402971165},"tweet_id":"122734808802672640"}]}}
