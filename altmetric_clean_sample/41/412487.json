The nanodimer consists of a pair of catalytic and chemically inactive spheres, in general with different sizes, with a fixed internuclear separation. The solvent in which the dimer moves is treated at a particle-based mesoscopic level using multiparticle collision dynamics. The directed motion of the dimer can be controlled by adjusting the interaction potentials between the solvent molecules and the dimer spheres, the internuclear separation, and sphere sizes. Dimers can be designed so that the directed motion along the internuclear axis occurs in either direction and is much larger than the thermal velocity fluctuations, a condition needed for such nanodimers to perform tasks involving targeted dynamics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2008JChPh.128p4518T","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Kapral, Raymond"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.2908078","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T05:22:29+00:00","issns":["00219606"],"journal":"Journal of Chemical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1222038000,"links":["http:\/\/link.aip.org\/link\/?JCPSA6\/128\/164518\/1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1063\/1.2908078"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aip.org\/link\/?JCPSA6\/128\/164518\/1\/pdf","pmid":"18447470","pubdate":"2008-05-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Institute of Physics","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Design of chemically propelled nanodimer motors","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-chemically-propelled-nanodimer-motors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.248,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.248},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685758,"mean":4.9523304688866,"rank":573406,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3111978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685758,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66689,"mean":3.7996855206334,"rank":9012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":57664,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66689,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3106,"mean":2.0487922705314,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3106,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.01,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
