Participants (N=719) previously primed with DTaP-IPV\/\/PRP\u223cT at 2, 3, 4 months (Group A, N=255), 3, 4, 5 months (Group B, N=233), or DTaP (Wuhan Institute of Biological Products), PRP-T (Act-Hib\u00ae) and IPV (Imovax\u00ae Polio) at 3, 4, 5 months (Group C, N=231) received boosters of the same vaccines at 18-20 months of age. Seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) were determined before and 1 month after the booster. Safety was monitored from parental reports. In all groups 87.6-100% of participants had pre-booster protective anti-PRP, -diphtheria, -tetanus and -poliovirus antibody titers; post-booster, all SP rates were 100% and SC was \u2265 80.4% for anti-pertussis titers \u2265 4-fold increase. Reactogenicity was low for each group. These data support the use of the DTaP-IPV\/\/PRP\u223cT vaccine in the People's Republic of China compared to separate DTaP, IPV, and PRP\u223cT administration in terms of both safety and immunogenicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2011.09.131","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T14:04:43+00:00","issns":["0264410X"],"journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1318946563,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X1101588X"],"pmid":"22001281","pubdate":"2011-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Antibody persistence at 18\u201320 months of age and safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of a combined DTaP\u2013IPV\/\/PRP\u223cT vaccine compared to separate vaccines (DTaP, PRP\u223cT and IPV) following primary vaccination of healthy infants with in the People's Republic of China\u2606 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antibody-persistence-1820months-age-safety-immunogenicity-booster-dose-combined-dtapipvprpt-vaccine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1695173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71506,"mean":4.5832277463114,"rank":31283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71506,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3448,"mean":5.5953878735132,"rank":1909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3448,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":121,"mean":5.5528333333333,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":121,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
