Because of its design, removal of this device may require special techniques to preserve host bone. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUES: Techniques needed include removal of a small amount of bone to relieve compressive forces, use of a pin extractor and\/or Kirschner wires for removal of transfixation pins, and creation of a cortical window in the diaphysis to gain access to bone preventing removal of the anchor plug.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256d","doi":"10.1007\/s11999-011-2128-z","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T15:52:44+00:00","issns":["1528-1132"],"journal":"Clinical Orthopaedics & Related Research","last_mentioned_on":1322834386,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22002827?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/6242222366648951\/"],"pmid":"22002827","pubdate":"2011-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Surgical Technique: Methods for Removing a Compress\u00ae Compliant Prestress Implant.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgical-technique-methods-removing-compress-compliant-prestress-implant"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2081526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2872570,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71517,"mean":4.5912250405503,"rank":22293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":47083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71517,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2847,"mean":2.7168109627547,"rank":1126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2847,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":2.1995575221239,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
