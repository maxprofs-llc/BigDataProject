Capacity to adjust to such conditions may depend on the ability to self-regulate, that is, the ability to alter thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Self-regulation appears to rely on executive cognitive functions, and the current review, therefore, sought to draw attention to the impact of self-regulatory capacity and executive functions on chronic pain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002270","authors":["Lise Solberg Nes","Abbey R.
