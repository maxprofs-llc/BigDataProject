Chemotherapeutic agents have been associated with a variety of cutaneous reactions, including radiation recall dermatitis, hypersensitivity reactions, and erysipeloid reactions. Gemcitabine (2,2-difluorodeoxycytidine) is currently being used for treatment of a variety of solid malignancies, including carcinoma of the lung. The dermatitis involved with gemcitabine is typically a radiation recall reaction whereby an inflammatory reaction occurs in the area previously treated with radiotherapy. We describe here a case of Gemcitabine-induced pseudocellulitis that was unrelated to radiation exposure and manifested in an area of lymphedema. The pseudocellulitis in such cases could be related to the drug's pharmacokinetics and may last until the drug is displaced from the subcutaneous tissue of the affected area. Antibiotics have no role in the treatment, and diphenhydramine with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories may be used for symptomatic management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005717","doi":"10.1097\/mjt.0b013e3181eea6a4","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T09:13:56+00:00","issns":["1075-2765"],"issue":"","journal":"American journal of therapeutics (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1354577486,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/americantherapeutics\/9000\/00000\/Recurrent_Lower_Extremity_Pseudocellulitis.99707.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/americantherapeutics\/9000\/00000\/Recurrent_Lower_Extremity_Pseudocellulitis.99707.pdf","pmid":"20724909","pubdate":"2011-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"","title":"Recurrent Lower Extremity Pseudocellulitis","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recurrent-lower-extremity-pseudocellulitis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4770903,"mean":5.7215656817113,"rank":2367876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2259263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4770903,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70311,"mean":4.4992660503484,"rank":28114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":40085,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70311,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":499,"mean":1.6709879518072,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":499,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/AmJThera\/status\/123728629006991360","citation_ids":[415152],"posted_on":"2011-10-11T11:56:18+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"AmJThera","tweeter_id":289788780},"tweet_id":"123728629006991360"}],"facebook":[{"title":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/YspBDQ","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=121213618039122&id=232452153440171","citation_ids":[415152],"posted_on":"2012-12-03T23:31:26+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/232452153440171","facebook_wall_name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/232452153440171\/picture","id_on_source":"232452153440171"}}]}}
