However, the tools with which genes can be found and functionally characterized have not been readily adapted to be part of the everyday biological sciences toolkit. Most annotation pipelines remain as a service provided by large institutions or come as an unwieldy conglomerate of independent components, each requiring their own setup and maintenance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Andrew S Warren","Jo\u00e3o Setubal"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-10-35","first_seen_on":"2011-10-18T05:50:46+00:00","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1233273600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2105-10-35"],"pmid":"19173744","pubdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"35","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"The Genome Reverse Compiler: an explorative annotation tool","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genome-reverse-compiler-explorative-annotation-tool"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631167,"mean":4.9271322908448,"rank":327985,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3274753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631167,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66545,"mean":3.797124008175,"rank":5629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":60559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66545,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":4.2644370629371,"rank":272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":2008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.2595853658537,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":18,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
