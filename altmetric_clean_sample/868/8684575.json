Current dose adjustments recommended for renally excreted lenalidomide are based on data from noncancer patients. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and exposure-response for lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with relapsed\/refractory MM and stable RI using the recommended dose adjustments.\nThis phase 2 multicenter, open-label study stratified patients into 5 groups based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation: normal renal function (CrCl\u00a0>\u00a080\u00a0mL\/min), mild RI (50\u00a0\u2264\u00a0CrCl\u00a0\u2264\u00a080\u00a0mL\/min), moderate RI (30\u00a0\u2264\u00a0CrCl\u00a0<\u00a050\u00a0mL\/min), severe RI (CrCl\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0mL\/min), and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Dosing was based on the lenalidomide label.\nAmong 38 patients, the median age was 68 (range 62-74) years, and poorer renal function was associated with older age, more advanced disease, and more lines of prior therapy. Lenalidomide clearance declined with decreased CrCl. Mean lenalidomide area under plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was within \u00b125\u00a0% of the target AUC in each group. Overall response was 76\u00a0%, and safety profiles were similar across groups, with no exposure-dependent trend in efficacy or toxicity. Estimated glomerular filtration rates calculated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation highly correlated with lenalidomide clearance and, in 87\u00a0% of patients, would lead to assigning the same starting dose of lenalidomide as CrCl.\nIn patients with stable renal function, the recommended dose adjustments achieved proper plasma exposure and similar safety and efficacy across renal groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002497","authors":["Bridoux, Frank","Chen, Nianhang","Moreau, Stephane","Arnulf, Bertrand","Moumas, Eric","Abraham, Julie","Desport, Estelle","Jaccard, Arnaud","Fermand, Jean Paul"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00280-016-3068-9","first_seen_on":"2016-06-12T14:32:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0843","0344-5704"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cancer Chemotherapy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1465726356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27286995?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27286995","pubdate":"2016-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","antineoplasticagents"],"title":"Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma and renal impairment","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacokinetics-safety-efficacy-lenalidomide-plus-dexamethasone-patients-multiple-myeloma-renal-imp-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":6828286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268042,"mean":11.445936875328,"rank":223527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268042,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":2.382897314376,"rank":478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.3706896551724,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
