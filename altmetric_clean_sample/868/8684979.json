We examined whether MRI use decreases CBC occurrences and detection of invasive disease among women who develop a CBC. Utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare dataset, we assessed overall, synchronous (<6\u00a0months after primary cancer diagnosis), and subsequent (\u22656\u00a0months after diagnosis, i.e., metachronous) CBC occurrence in women aged 67-94\u00a0years diagnosed with DCIS during 2004-2009, with follow-up through 2011. We applied a matched propensity score approach to compare the stage-specific incidence rate of CBC according to MRI use. Our sample consisted of 9166 beneficiaries, 1258 (13.7\u00a0%) of whom received preoperative MRI. After propensity score matching, preoperative MRI use was significantly associated with a higher synchronous CBC detection rate (108.6 vs. 29.7 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a03.65; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) with no significant differences in subsequent CBC rate (6.7 vs. 6.8 per 1000 person-years; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.90; p\u00a0=\u00a0.71). The 6-year cumulative incidence of any CBC (in situ plus invasive) remained significantly higher among women undergoing MRI, compared with those not undergoing MRI (9 vs. 4\u00a0%, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Women undergoing MRI also had a higher incidence of invasive CBC (4 vs. 3\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). MRI use resulted in an increased detection of synchronous CBC but did not prevent subsequent CBC occurrence, suggesting that many of the undetected CBC lesions may not become clinically evident.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006cf8","authors":["Wang, Shi-Yi","Long, Jessica B","Killelea, Brigid K","Evans, Suzanne B","Roberts, Kenneth B","Silber, Andrea","Gross, Cary P","Shi-Yi Wang","Jessica B.
