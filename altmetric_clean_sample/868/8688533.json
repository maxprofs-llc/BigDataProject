The two main metabolites, protectin D1 (PD1) and its regioisomer maresin 1 (MaR1), were shown to be actively involved in the resolution and more specifically the termination of the inflammation process. Studies directed at the synthesis of E,E,Z-docosatrienes have been undertaken to resolve stereochemical ambiguities, and provide standards for biological evaluation and reference samples for in-vivo detection and lipidomic analyses. In this review we provide a brief update of the literature on the biological significance of E,E,Z-docosatrienes and the role that synthetic organic chemists has played in the development of these lipids, providing an overview and comparison of the different strategies employed to access synthetic E,E,Z-docosatriene standards.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033b1","authors":["Balas, Laurence","Durand, Thierry"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.plipres.2015.10.002","endpage":"18","first_seen_on":"2016-06-12T23:46:14+00:00","issns":["1873-2194","01637827"],"journal":"Progress in Lipid Research","last_mentioned_on":1466691121,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.plipres.2015.10.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26545300"],"pmid":"26545300","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Dihydroxylated E,E,Z-docosatrienes.
