Unlike \"classical\" non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), gastroenteritis is often absent during ST313 infections and isolates are most commonly recovered from blood, rather than from stool. This is consistent with observations in animals, in which ST313 strains displayed lower levels of intestinal colonization and higher recovery from deeper tissues relative to classic NTS isolates. A better understanding of the key environmental factors regulating these systemic infections is urgently needed. Our previous studies using dynamic Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology demonstrated that physiological levels of fluid shear regulate virulence, gene expression, and stress response profiles of classic S. Typhimurium. Here we provide the first demonstration that fluid shear alters the virulence potential and pathogenesis-related stress responses of ST313 strain D23580 in a manner that differs from classic NTS.","altmetric_jid":"55f17ebf2a83ee43768b4586","authors":["Jiseon Yang","Jennifer Barrila","Kenneth L Roland","C Mark Ott","Cheryl A Nickerson"],"doi":"10.1038\/npjmgrav.2016.21","first_seen_on":"2016-06-12T17:10:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2373-8065"],"journal":"npj Microgravity","last_mentioned_on":1497278640,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/npjmgrav.2016.21","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/npjmgrav201621?WT.ec_id=NPJMGRAV-201606&spMailingID=51720755&spUserID=MjA5MjA4NDk5OTM4S0&spJobID=944204722&spReportId=OTQ0MjA0NzIyS0","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/npjmgrav201621","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/npjmgrav201621?WT.mc_id=COM_NPJMGRAV_1601_Nickerson"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/npjmgrav201621.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5515522","pmid":"28725732","pubdate":"2016-06-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biophysics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"16021","title":"Physiological fluid shear alters the virulence potential of invasive multidrug-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella Typhimurium D23580","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physiological-fluid-shear-alters-virulence-potential-invasive-multidrugresistant-nontyphoidal-salmon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":20.66,"score_history":{"1y":10.16,"6m":10.16,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":20.66},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":426215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7928919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271806,"mean":11.629763874836,"rank":21653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":250151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271806,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":35.789193548387,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":27.444333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
