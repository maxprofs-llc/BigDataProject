Primary HLH consists of monogenic disorders that mainly affect the perforin-mediated cytotoxicity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Secondary HLH occurs as a complication in various settings such as infections, malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Both primary and secondary HLH are characterized by uncontrolled hypercytokinemia that results in myelosuppression and vascular endothelium damage. More than 10% of patients with HLH die within 2 months of the diagnosis due to bleeding in the visceral organs, opportunistic infections due to neutropenia, or multiple organ failure. The most obvious presentations of HLH are persistent fever that is refractory to antimicrobial agents and hyperferritinemia that is the result of the hypersecretion of various cytokines. The first rule is not to overlook signs of hypercytokinemia and to calm down the hyperactivated immunological state as soon as possible. In addition, to improve outcomes, it is essential to search for the disorders underlying the HLH and provide the disorder-appropriate treatment. This article is protected by copyright.
