Subsequent workup revealed concurrent spontaneous dissections in three separate medium-sized arterial beds.\nShe was successfully managed in a conservative fashion, highlighting that percutaneous or surgical revascularization can often be foregone in favor of conservative medical therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000858","authors":["Sean Spence","Sean Spence","Maneesh Sud","Ravi Bajaj","Anna Zavodni","Sharron Sandhu","Mina Madan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13256-016-0937-0","first_seen_on":"2016-06-12T17:09:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1752-1947"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1465733852,"links":["http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s13256-016-0937-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s13256-016-0937-0?site=http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4897916","pmid":"27268217","pubdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"General Practice \/ Family Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Primary Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Postpartum spontaneous coronary, vertebral, and mesenteric artery dissections: a case report","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/postpartum-spontaneous-coronary-vertebral-mesenteric-artery-dissections-case-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":4133458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2198067,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268042,"mean":11.445902179144,"rank":145304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96306,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268042,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1456,"mean":3.2341003436426,"rank":552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1456,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":11.62619047619,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NinhRHM\/statuses\/741967669960671233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8686003],"posted_on":"2016-06-12T12:17:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Anh Ninh RHM Nguyen","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"NinhRHM","tweeter_id":"2402916860","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4},"tweet_id":"741967669960671233"}]}}
