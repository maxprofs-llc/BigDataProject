Forty-three parents completed the survey. Results indicated that children's ability to communicate pain verbally did not influence whether or not their parent reported observing pain. Most children (67%) were reported to have displayed pain within the month prior to rating. All pain behaviors on the Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist (Dev Med Child Neurol 40 (1998) 340) were endorsed by some parents, and few additional pain behaviors were identified, suggesting that this instrument adequately samples the pain behavior of children with CP. Assisted stretching was the daily living activity most frequently identified as painful by parents (93% of those reporting pain), and the one with the highest mean pain intensity. Needle injection (40%) was the medical and nursing procedure most frequently identified by parents as painful for their children. Range of motion manipulation was the therapy most frequently identified as painful by parents (58%), and the one with the highest mean intensity. Parents are able to observe pain in their children with CP regardless of the child's verbal fluency. Knowledge of behaviors and painful situations identified by parents can facilitate management of pain in children with CP.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Hadden, Kellie L","von Baeyer, Carl L"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-02T05:59:32+00:00","issns":["0304-3959"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1483302600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12237206"],"pmid":"12237206","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Pain in children with cerebral palsy: common triggers and expressive behaviors.","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pain-children-cerebral-palsy-common-triggers-expressive-behaviors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7971101,"mean":6.7313029448827,"rank":1518268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6421621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7971101,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253035,"mean":12.563765920785,"rank":68911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":183735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253035,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3220,"mean":9.3627797452625,"rank":1041,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":2165,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3220,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":30.564216216216,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
