These error rates tend to differ between cases and controls because diagnostic and screening tests have different sensitivity and specificity. This increases the inaccuracies of classifying individuals into correct groups, giving rise to both false-positive and false-negative cases. The analysis of these noisy binary responses due to misclassification will undoubtedly reduce the statistical power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A threshold model that accommodates varying diagnostic errors between cases and controls was investigated. A simulation study was carried out where several binary data sets (case-control) were generated with varying effects for the most influential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and different diagnostic error rate for cases and controls. Each simulated data set consisted of 2000 individuals. Ignoring misclassification resulted in biased estimates of true influential SNP effects and inflated estimates for true noninfluential markers. A substantial reduction in bias and increase in accuracy ranging from 12% to 32% was observed when the misclassification procedure was invoked. In fact, the majority of influential SNPs that were not identified using the noisy data were captured using the proposed method. Additionally, truly misclassified binary records were identified with high probability using the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed method was maintained across different simulation parameters (misclassification rates and odds ratios) attesting to its robustness.","authors":["Romdhane Rekaya","Shannon Smith","El Hammidi Hay","Nourhene Farhat","Samuel E Aggrey"],"doi":"10.2147\/tacg.s122250","endpage":"177","first_seen_on":"2017-01-02T05:31:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1178-704X"],"journal":"The Application of Clinical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1483454557,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/analysis-of-binary-responses-with-outcome-specific-misclassification-p-peer-reviewed-article-TACG"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=33839","pmcid":"PMC5138056","pmid":"27942229","pubdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","startpage":"169","title":"Analysis of binary responses with outcome-specific misclassification probability in genome-wide association studies","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-binary-responses-outcomespecific-misclassification-probability-genomewide-association-studi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/prashbio\/statuses\/815792504096243712","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15188366],"posted_on":"2017-01-02T05:31:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Prash Suravajhala","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/prashbio","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/621244056035655680\/XX8S7DhJ_normal.jpg","description":"Systems Biologist, Bioinformaticist, Functional Genomicist, Enthusiast, Learner, Dreamer, Mentor, Rotarian and Wiki-episodic Editor","id_on_source":"prashbio","tweeter_id":"49546022","geo":{"lt":26.91962,"ln":75.78781,"country":"IN"},"followers":699},"tweet_id":"815792504096243712"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePress\/statuses\/816293695897169921","license":"gnip","rt":["prashbio"],"citation_ids":[15188366],"posted_on":"2017-01-03T14:42:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Medical Press","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/692429184925339650\/bBX8nMY7_normal.png","description":"Open access publisher of 130+ peer-reviewed journals across science, tech and medicine.
