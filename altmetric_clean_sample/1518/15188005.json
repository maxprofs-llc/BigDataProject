The sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0358), was further divided into three groups: those on ART continuously since initiation (n\u00a0=\u00a0208, 58.1%); those on ART intermittently (n\u00a0=\u00a0117, 32.7%); and those not on ART at the time of survey (n\u00a0=\u00a033, 9.2%). ART non-users were the most likely to hold serious concerns about ART that outweighed perceived necessities (benefits) from ART (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.13; 95% CI 0.06-0.29; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). They were also the least self-efficacious in HIV disease management (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.29; 95% CI 0.09-0.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). Intermittent ART users were more likely to receive their HIV diagnosis prior to 2003 (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.38; 95% CI 0.28-0.53; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and perceive lower HIV management self-efficacy (AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) than continuous users. ART-related beliefs and perceived self-efficacy in HIV self-management play an important role in achieving universal treatment uptake and sustained high levels of adherence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Mao, Limin","de Wit, John","Adam, Philippe","Post, Jeffrey J","Slavin, Sean","Cogle, Aaron","Wright, Edwina","Kidd, Michael","Limin Mao","John de Wit","Philippe Adam","Jeffrey J.
