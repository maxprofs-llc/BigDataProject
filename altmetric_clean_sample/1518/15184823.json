However, intrinsic and acquired resistance to gemcitabine inevitably occurs. The aims of this study were to assess the efficacy of the combination of src inhibition and gemcitabine in gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer cells.\nBy using colony formation, sphere forming, flow cytometry, cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays, 231\/GEM-res (gemcitabine-resistant) cell line, which was 10 times more resistant, was shown to have elevated drug tolerance, enhanced proliferative and self-renewal abilities, compared with its parental cells. Inhibition of src by both saracatinib (AZD0530) and siRNA could partially reverse gemcitabine resistance and attenuate resistance-associated anti-apoptosis, migration and stem cell capacities. In addition, the combination of src inhibition and gemcitabine had synergistic antitumor effects. Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of pro-apoptotic protein BAX, along with the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-XL, Survivin), migration associated proteins (p-FAK, MMP-3) and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD44, Oct-4), which was probably mediated by AKT\/c-Jun pathway.\nIn highly gemcitabine-resistant 231 cells, src inhibition can synergize with gemcitabine, reverse drug resistance, inhibit tumor growth\/metastasis\/stemness of cancer stem cells, possibly via the AKT\/c-Jun pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Zhen-Hua Wu","Chen Lin","Ming-Ming Liu","Jian Zhang","Zhong-Hua Tao","Xi-Chun Hu"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0169230","first_seen_on":"2017-01-01T17:45:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1483406288,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0169230"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0169230&type=printable","pmid":"28036386","pubdate":"2016-12-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0169230","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Src Inhibition Can Synergize with Gemcitabine and Reverse Resistance in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells via the AKT\/c-Jun Pathway.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/src-inhibition-synergize-gemcitabine-reverse-resistance-triple-negative-breast-cancer-cells-via-aktc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":2.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3296782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4628994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253790,"mean":12.521998108665,"rank":102922,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":148545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253790,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112041,"mean":10.343755712246,"rank":44355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":65987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112041,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3934,"mean":12.384228832952,"rank":1606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3934,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
