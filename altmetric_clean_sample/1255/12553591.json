With synthetic alternatives, such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), less sensor development time and higher stability of the binder can be achieved. In this feature paper, I will discuss the impact of synthetic binders from an industrial perspective and I will challenge the molecular imprinting community on the next step to leapfrog the current status quo of MIPs for (bio)sensing. Equally important, but often neglected as an effective chemical sensor, is a good match of transducer and MIP coating for a respective application. To demonstrate an application-driven development, a biosensing use case with surface-imprinted layers on piezoacoustic sensors is reported. Depending on the electrode pattern for the transducer, the strong mechanical coupling of the analyte with the MIP layer coated device allows the adoption of the sensitivity from cell mass to cell viability with complete reversibility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Oliver Hayden"],"doi":"10.3390\/s16101665","first_seen_on":"2016-10-11T01:44:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"10","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1476150278,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/10\/1665"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/16\/10\/1665\/pdf","pmid":"27735880","pubdate":"2016-10-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1665","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"One Binder to Bind Them All","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/one-binder-bind-them"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":6517107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239022,"mean":12.448484819325,"rank":196748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239022,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2853,"mean":1.8111023842917,"rank":1919,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2853,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":312,"mean":1.5403536977492,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":312,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Chemistry":3,"Computer Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sensors_MDPI\/statuses\/785657330251603968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12553591],"posted_on":"2016-10-11T01:44:38+00:00","author":{"name":"@Sensors_MDPI","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/rPrToAqh0i","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/644194401313361920\/_TWXMHk9_normal.jpg","description":"Sensors (ISSN 1424-8220; IF: 2.245) is the leading international, peer-reviewed, open access journal on the science and technology of sensors and biosensors.","id_on_source":"Sensors_MDPI","tweeter_id":"3584565133","followers":136},"tweet_id":"785657330251603968"}]}}
