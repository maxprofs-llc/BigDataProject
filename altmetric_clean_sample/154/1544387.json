This article reviews the literature on adaptive mutagenesis since 1993. The evidence that adaptive mutagenesis is both real and general is considered. The most widely used system for studying adaptive mutagenesis, reversion of an F'-borne lacI33 allele, is shown to be a special case that reflects more about F-plasmid biology than about adaptive mutagenesis in general. New evidence demonstrating that adaptive mutagenesis is, indeed, specific is discussed. A variety of genes whose products affect adaptive mutagenesis are discussed. A model to explain that specificity and new evidence in support of that model are considered, as are potential roles of adaptive mutagenesis in evolution and practical aspects of adaptive mutagenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007521","authors":["Hall, B G"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-10T10:43:06+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0016-6707"],"issue":"1-6","journal":"Genetica","last_mentioned_on":1354886711,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9720275"],"pmid":"9720275","pubdate":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Adaptive mutagenesis: a process that generates almost exclusively beneficial mutations.","type":"article","volume":"102-103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptive-mutagenesis-process-generates-almost-exclusively-beneficial-mutations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":327597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3280798,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85635,"mean":7.0636392320809,"rank":10884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":74486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85635,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":2.4166090534979,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
