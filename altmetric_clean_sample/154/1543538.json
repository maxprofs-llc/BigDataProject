The novelty of this work is the design of the glycosyl donor locked into the axial-rich form by the o-xylylene bridge between the 3-O and 6-O of d-glucopyranose. The synthesized 2,4-di-O-benzyl-3,6-O-(o-xylyene)glucopyranosyl fluoride could efficiently react with various alcohols in a SnCl(2)-AgB(C(6)F(5))(4) catalytic system. The mechanism composed of the glycosylation and isomerization cycles was revealed through comparative experiments using acidic and basic molecular sieves. The achieved perfect stereocontrol is attributed to the synergy of the axial-rich conformation and convergent isomerization caused by HB(C(6)F(5))(4) generated in situ.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Yasunori Okada"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja301480g","first_seen_on":"2013-06-10T01:22:08+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1360101593,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja301480g"],"pmid":"22475375","pubdate":"2012-04-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Completely \u03b2-Selective Glycosylation Using 3,6-O-(o-Xylylene)-Bridged Axial-Rich Glucosyl Fluoride","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/completely-%CE%B2selective-glycosylation-using-36-ooxylylenebridged-axialrich-glucosyl-fluoride"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.12,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.12},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":577948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3050313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85492,"mean":7.0977254447838,"rank":16618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":68870,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85492,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12981,"mean":4.1125597842835,"rank":2909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":10063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12981,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":525,"mean":5.4962328244275,"rank":112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":525,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
