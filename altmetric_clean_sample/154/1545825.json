The paper explores how two aspects of Jung's view of the psyche as healthily dissociable were used to think about the potential for change contained within the explosive, aggressive energies in this patient's bingeing. The resultant approach takes the patient's splitting defences, dissociations and self-destructive behaviour as a point of access to her unconscious. Seen in this way, these behaviours contain the seeds of recovery and are the starting point for analysis rather than defences against it. The paper also brings a number of Jungian and post-Jungian ideas into conversation with aspects of contemporary thinking about subjectivity, identity and the longing for excess developed by Leo Bersani and Judith Butler.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7d","authors":["Austin, Sue"],"doi":"10.1111\/1468-5922.12009","endpage":"326","first_seen_on":"2013-06-10T15:51:31+00:00","issns":["1468-5922","0021-8774"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Analytical Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1370879477,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1468-5922.12009\/abstract;jsessionid=584844BBEFE7DA57F4076C79AF295A58.d03t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1468-5922.12009\/pdf","pmid":"23750938","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"309","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"I Working with dissociative dynamics and the longing for excess in binge eating disorders","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/i-working-dissociative-dynamics-longing-excess-binge-eating-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6289149,"mean":5.9799639738173,"rank":2956680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1880420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6289149,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100126,"mean":7.4091147465668,"rank":49640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":36920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100126,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175,"mean":2.5301724137931,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
