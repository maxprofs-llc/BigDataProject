Although not much is known about this, it is evident that well-coordinated cell-cell signaling is critical in this process to confine infection to local tissue while allowing for the spread of systemic immune signals throughout the whole plant. In support of this notion, direct cell-to-cell communication was recently found to play a crucial role in plant defense. Here, we provide experimental evidence that salicylic acid (SA) is a critical hormonal signal that regulates cell-to-cell permeability during innate immune responses elicited by virulent bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that direct exogenous application of SA or bacterial infection suppresses cell-cell coupling and that SA pathway mutants are impaired in this response. The SA- or infection-induced suppression of cell-cell coupling requires an enhanced desease resistance1- and nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes1-dependent SA pathway in conjunction with the regulator of plasmodesmal gating Plasmodesmata-located protein5. We discuss a model wherein the SA signaling pathway and plasmodesmata-mediated cell-to-cell communication converge under an intricate regulatory loop.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003335","authors":["Xu Wang","Ross Sager","Weier Cui","Chong Zhang","Hua Lu","Jung-Youn Lee"],"doi":"10.1105\/tpc.113.110676","first_seen_on":"2013-06-11T04:53:51+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1532-298X"],"journal":"Plant Cell","last_mentioned_on":1502986329,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantcell.org\/content\/early\/2013\/06\/06\/tpc.113.110676.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1105\/tpc.113.110676"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantcell.org\/content\/early\/2013\/06\/06\/tpc.113.110676.full.pdf","pmid":"23749844","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Salicylic Acid Regulates Plasmodesmata Closure during Innate Immune Responses in Arabidopsis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/salicylic-acid-regulates-plasmodesmata-closure-during-innate-immune-responses-arabidopsis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":2152530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5090861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125678,"mean":7.0382963151573,"rank":33196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":87025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125678,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2568,"mean":5.9409902610051,"rank":906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2568,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":5.5916666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
