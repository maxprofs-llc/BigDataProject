NC is a rare epidermal nevus type. It is part of the nevus comedonicus syndrome, a neurocutaneous disorder with ocular, skeletal, and central nervous symptoms. Recently, acne-related signaling pathways and somatic mutations of tyrosine kinase receptors have been identified and may play a role in NC pathogenesis. On preexistent NC secondary skin tumors can develop, which are often benign. Treatment options of NC include topical therapy, laser, and surgery.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f6100070d6","authors":["Georgi Tchernev","Julian Ananiev","Kristina Semkova","Lyubomir A.
