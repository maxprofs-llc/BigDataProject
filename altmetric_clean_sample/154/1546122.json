GBM is characterized by the hallmarks of rapid proliferation and aggressive invasion. miR-451 is known to play a key role in glioblastoma by modulating the balance of active proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the microenvironment. The present paper develops a mathematical model of GBM evolution which focuses on the relative balance of growth and invasion. In the present work we represent the miR-451\/AMPK pathway by a simple model and show how the effects of glucose on cells need to be \"refined\" by taking into account the recent history of glucose variations. The simulations show how variations in glucose significantly affect the level of miR-451 and, in turn, cell migration. The model predicts that oscillations in the levels of glucose increase the growth of the primary tumor. The model also suggests that drugs which upregulate miR-451, or block other components of the CAB39\/AMPK pathway, will slow down glioma cell migration. The model provides an explanation for the growth-invasion cycling patterns of glioma cells in response to high\/low glucose uptake in microenvironment in vitro, and suggests new targets for drugs, associated with miR-451 upregulation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yangjin Kim","Soyeon Roh","Sean Lawler","Avner Friedman"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0028293","first_seen_on":"2013-06-10T18:05:10+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1435323317,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028293","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028293"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0028293.pdf","pmid":"22205943","pubdate":"2011-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e28293","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"miR451 and AMPK Mutual Antagonism in Glioma Cell Migration and Proliferation: A Mathematical Model","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir451-ampk-mutual-antagonism-glioma-cell-migration-proliferation-mathematical-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5279668,"mean":6.2126101187845,"rank":2777814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2477719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5279668,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96089,"mean":7.4393738031804,"rank":47413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":48160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96089,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92496,"mean":9.5156953781285,"rank":52313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":39826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92496,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3638,"mean":11.467401154798,"rank":2085,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3638,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
