Lauryl-capped PLGA and uncapped PLGA (referred to as PLGA-capped and PLGA-COOH, respectively) particles (0.3, 1 and 20 \u03bcm) were prepared by a double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein for release studies. During degradation (PBS buffer, pH7.4 at 37\u00b0C), a slower dry mass loss was observed for 0.3 \u03bcm particles than for particles of 1 and 20 \u03bcm. It was further shown that PLGA-capped particles showed slower mass loss likely due to its more hydrophobic nature. It was found that the ester bond hydrolysis rate was substantially slower for PLGA-capped particles and that the rate increased with particle size. Particles showed enrichment in lactic acid content (and thus a decrease in glycolic acid content) in time, and interestingly PLGA-capped particles showed also an enrichment of the lauryl alcohol content. No difference was observed in degradation kinetics between BSA loaded and blank particles. Independent of size, PLGA-COOH based particles showed, after a small burst, a sustained and nearly complete release of BSA during 60-80 days. On the other hand, particles based on PLGA-capped showed a much slower release and exhibited incomplete release, accompanied by the presence of an insoluble residue remaining even after 180 days. FTIR analysis of this residue showed that it contained both polymer and protein. Considering the polymer enrichment in lauryl alcohol, the incomplete release observed for PLGA-capped is likely attributed to interactions between the protein and the lauryl end group. In conclusion, since PLGA-COOH, in contrast to the capped derivative, shows complete degradation as well as quantitative release of an entrapped protein, this polymer is preferred for the design of protein formulations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d37","authors":["N.
