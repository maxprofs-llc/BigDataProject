The study was carried out on male construction workers of which 80% were long-distance commuters. The schedule involved two work periods and each work period involved two double shifts in a row. The subjects filled in a sleep\/wake diary at 8 times across a year and a questionnaire at 3 times. They also wore an actigraph during one shift cycle. The results showed that sleepiness, and to a certain extent, mental fatigue increased during double shifts and accumulated across days. The short rest time (8.5 hours) between days caused insufficient sleep and approximately 5.5 hours of sleep was obtained between double shifts. Questionnaire data showed that complaints of insufficient sleep, exhaustion on awakening and pain symptoms increased across the year. It was concluded that a shift system involving double shifts has a negative effect on fatigue, recovery and health-related well-being.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d9dd","authors":["Kecklund, G","Ekstedt, M","Akerstedt, T","Dahlgren, A","Samuelson, B"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-08T21:13:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0300-8134"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of human ergology","last_mentioned_on":1370726035,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14564858\/"],"pmid":"14564858","pubdate":"2001-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"The effects of double-shifts (15.5 hours) on sleep, fatigue and health.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-doubleshifts-155-hours-sleep-fatigue-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088082,"mean":6.8819946474248,"rank":4043521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3838503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088082,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123898,"mean":6.9454237955723,"rank":55061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":65173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123898,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":15.709333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
