Forty male Wistar rats weighing approximately 300 g each were divided into four groups: control (C); control submitted to LED phototherapy (CLed); Sciatic Nerve Lesion without LED phototherapy (L); Sciatic Nerve Lesion with LED phototherapy (LLed). The lesion was caused by crushing the right sciatic nerve. A dose of 4 J\/cm(2) was used for ten consecutive days beginning on the first postoperative day. Groups C and L were submitted to the same procedure as the LLed group, but the equipment was turned off. The LED phototherapy with 940 nm wavelength reduced the areas of edema, the number of mononuclear cells present in the inflammatory infiltration, and increased functional recovery scores at 7, 14 and 21 days. The results suggest that the use of phototherapy at 940 nm after nerve damage improves morphofunctional recovery and nerve regeneration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fe2","authors":["Serafim KG","Ramos SD","de Lima FM","Carandina M","Ferrari O","Dias IF","Toginho Filho DD","Siqueira CP"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10103-011-0923-0","first_seen_on":"2013-06-12T01:03:38+00:00","issns":["1435-604X"],"issue":"","journal":"Lasers in Medical Science","last_mentioned_on":1430231968,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21547474","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s10103-011-0923-0"],"pmid":"21547474","pubdate":"2011-05-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laser Technology, Photonics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Optics, Optoelectronics, Plasmonics and Optical Devices","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quantum Optics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Effects of 940 nm light-emitting diode (led) on sciatic nerve regeneration in rats","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-940-nm-lightemitting-diode-led-sciatic-nerve-regeneration-rats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032449,"mean":5.9702691497267,"rank":2306553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2599124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032449,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94449,"mean":7.3942989581569,"rank":39214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94449,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":436,"mean":1.2913563218391,"rank":93,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":436,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.82894736842105,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
