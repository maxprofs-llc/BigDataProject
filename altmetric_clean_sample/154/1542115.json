The utilization pattern is compared to the results of a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on their effectiveness. The study found that 74.7% of individuals prescribed a statin had no reported history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Women without CHD formed 23.1% of statins recipients; 32.9% of individuals filling a statin prescription were age 70 and over. Only 15.3% of men with CHD had been prescribed a statin. Based on the systematic review, 88.7% of the utilization of statins in this Canadian province was not supported by the results of the systematic review. Considering baseline lipid-levels does not substantially alter these findings. This study concludes that statins prescribing practices need to be realigned with research evidence. This implies refocusing utilization away from women and the elderly, towards men with CHD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfd","authors":["Savoie, Isabelle","Kazanjian, Armin\u00e9e"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-09T15:36:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0895-4356"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Clinical Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1383446949,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11781127","http:\/\/www.jclinepi.com\/article\/S0895-4356(01)00436-X\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jclinepi.com\/article\/S0895-4356%2801%2900436-X\/abstract"],"pmid":"11781127","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Utilization of lipid-lowering drugs in men and women. a reflection of the research evidence?","type":"article","volume":"55","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilization-lipidlowering-drugs-men-women-reflection-research-evidence"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.222,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.222},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7140581,"mean":6.3066528900984,"rank":747356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6393332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7140581,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119940,"mean":6.691681971669,"rank":14203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":105737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119940,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1442,"mean":6.301600277585,"rank":172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":1270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1442,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.3285454545455,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreation":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Disease Creep: How we're fooled into using more medicine than we need.","url":"http:\/\/health.newamerica.net\/blogposts\/2011\/disease_creep_how_were_fooled_into_using_more_medicine_than_we_need-61818","license":"public","citation_ids":[1542115,1542116,180169],"posted_on":"2011-12-21T21:54:30+00:00","summary":"","author":{"name":"NewAmerica.net Blog Posts","url":"http:\/\/health.newamerica.net\/blogmain","description":""}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/timaustin73\/status\/396171803443216384","license":"public","citation_ids":[1542115],"posted_on":"2013-11-01T07:08:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Tim Austin","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1873291747\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Safety, psychology, health, behaviour, organisational culture.
