While we are far from a complete understanding, these studies have yielded important insights into human brain development. There is an ever growing variety of methods for assessing connectivity, each with its own advantages. Here we review research on the development of structural and\/or functional brain connectivity in both typically developing subjects and subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders. Space limitations preclude an exhaustive review of brain connectivity across all developmental disorders, so we review a representative selection of recent findings on brain connectivity in autism, Fragile X, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Williams syndrome, Turner syndrome, and ADHD. Major strides have been made in understanding the developmental trajectory of the human connectome, offering insight into characteristic features of brain development and biological processes involved in developmental brain disorders. We also discuss some common themes, including hemispheric specialization - or asymmetry - and sex differences. We conclude by discussing some promising future directions in connectomics, including the merger of imaging and genetics, and a deeper investigation of the relationships between structural and functional connectivity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b3f","authors":["Dennis, Emily L","Thompson, Paul M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijdevneu.2013.05.007","first_seen_on":"2013-06-10T12:05:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1873-474X"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1374138641,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23722009?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3800504","pmid":"23722009","pubdate":"2013-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Society for Developmental Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Mapping connectivity in the developing brain.","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/international-journal-developmental-neuroscience-mapping-connectivity-developing-brain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2924602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1434591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89753,"mean":7.2869588198593,"rank":58075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":28376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89753,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":1.7098139534884,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":152,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.27,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
