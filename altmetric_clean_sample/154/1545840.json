Despite evidence for apoptotic signaling, hepatic cell death after APAP is generally considered necrotic in mice and in humans. Recent findings suggest that the receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) acts as a switch from apoptosis to necrosis (programmed necrosis). Thus, the aim of the current investigation was to determine if RIP3 is involved in APAP-induced liver cell death. APAP (200-300 mg\/kg) caused glutathione depletion and protein adduct formation, oxidant stress, mitochondrial release of apoptosis inducing factor, and nuclear DNA fragmentation resulting in centrilobular necrosis in C57Bl\/6J mice. Inhibiting RIP3 protein induction with antisense morpholinos in wild-type animals or using RIP3-deficient mice had no effect on protein adduct formation but attenuated all other parameters, including necrotic cell death, at 6 hours after APAP. In addition, cultured hepatocytes from RIP3-deficient mice showed reduced injury compared to wild-type cells after 24 hours. Interestingly, APAP-induced mitochondrial translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), the initiator of mitochondrial fission, was inhibited by reduced RIP3 protein expression and the Drp1 inhibitor MDIVI reduced APAP-induced cell death at 24 hours. All of these protective effects were lost after 24 hours in vivo or 48 hours in vitro.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f610007619","authors":["Ramachandran A","McGill MR","Xie Y","Ni HM","Ding WX","Jaeschke H","Anup Ramachandran","Mitchell R.
