Maximum viable counts, acid production and sugar utilization by different test strains were in the order: glucose greater than or equal to fructose greater than sucrose greater than or equal to lactose greater than galactose. The generation time of the tested strains was shorter in glucose medium as compared to sucrose or lactose medium.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Srinivas, D","Mital, B K","Garg, S K"],"first_seen_on":"2013-06-11T22:38:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0168-1605"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1370980860,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2118792"],"pmid":"2118792","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Utilization of sugars by Lactobacillus acidophilus strains.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilization-sugars-lactobacillus-acidophilus-strains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.344,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.344},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3684317,"mean":4.9202481350715,"rank":561670,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3122524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3684317,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86071,"mean":7.0473073544789,"rank":16325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":69746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86071,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":763,"mean":2.12143832021,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":763,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":1.0383333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
