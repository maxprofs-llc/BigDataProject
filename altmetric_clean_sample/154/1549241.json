In UK prisons, drug users are nearly universally treated for their opiate use by primary care clinicians, and once released access GP services where 40% of practices now treat drug users. There is a paucity of evidence evaluating methadone and buprenorphine (the two most commonly prescribed agents in the UK) for opiate detoxification.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d12","authors":["Nat MJ Wright","Laura Sheard","Clive E Adams","Bruno J Rushforth","Wendy Harrison","Nicole Bound","Roger Hart","Charlotte NE Tompkins"],"doi":"10.3399\/bjgp11x613106","first_seen_on":"2013-06-11T19:24:56+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"handle":"1959.7\/uws:30884","handles":["1959.7\/uws:30884"],"isbns":[],"issns":["09601643","14785242","1478-5242"],"issue":"593","journal":"British Journal of General Practice","last_mentioned_on":1370978686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/rcgp\/bjgp\/2011\/00000061\/00000593\/art00033?token=005411ffd41333c4a2f7a3f6a38576b46543e3f67704f6d62222c227e37253033297665c8884f44f93e3","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3399\/bjgp11x613106"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjgp.org\/content\/bjgp\/61\/593\/e772.full.pdf","pmid":"22137413","pubdate":"2011-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Journal of General Practice","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Comparison of methadone and buprenorphine for opiate detoxification (LEEDS trial): a randomised controlled trial.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bjgp.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.3399\/bjgp11X613106","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-methadone-buprenorphine-opiate-detoxification-leeds-trial-randomised-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1591375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89902,"mean":7.3035307504924,"rank":45117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":31834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89902,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1205,"mean":5.3823289036545,"rank":721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":330,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1205,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":4.9743902439024,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
