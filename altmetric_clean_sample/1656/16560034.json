A kinetic study was carried out at 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 degrees C in aqueous solutions buffered at pH values of 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0. Under each experimental condition, the determination of the respective amounts of reactants and hydrolysis products showed that FOS hydrolysis obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics as the extent of hydrolysis, which decreased at increasing pH values, increased with temperature. The three oligomers were found to be degraded mainly under acidic conditions, and at the highest temperature value (120 degrees C), a quick and complete acid degradation of each FOS was observed. Using the Arrhenius equation, rate constants, half-life values, and activation energies were calculated and compared with those obtained from sucrose under the same experimental conditions. It appeared that the hydrolysis of FOS took place much more easily at acidic pH than at neutral or basic pH values.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["C. L'homme","M.
