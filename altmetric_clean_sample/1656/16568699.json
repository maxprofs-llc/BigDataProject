(arXiv:1702.05620v1 )"],"citation":{"abstract":"In the present work we analyzed the pupil size behavior of 40 subjects while they read well-defined sentences with different contextual predictability (i.e., regular sentences and proverbs). In general, pupil size increased when reading regular sentences, but when readers realized that they were reading proverbs their pupils strongly increase until finishing proverbs' reading. Our results suggest that an increased pupil size is not limited to cognitive load (i.e., relative difficulty in processing) because when participants accurately recognized words during reading proverbs, theirs pupil size increased too. Our results show that pupil size dynamics may be a reliable measure to investigate the cognitive processes involved in sentence processing and memory functioning.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e01","arxiv_id":"1702.05620","authors":["Gerardo Fern\u00e1ndez","Juan Biondi","Silvia Castro","Osvaldo Agamennoni"],"doi":"10.1142\/s0219635216500266","first_seen_on":"2017-02-21T01:51:41+00:00","issns":["0219-6352","1757-448X"],"journal":"Journal of Integrative Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1487703288,"links":["https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1702.05620?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1702.05620","https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1702.05620.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1702.05620v1","pmid":"28077002","pubdate":"2017-02-18T15:03:58+00:00","publisher":"World Scientific Pub Co Pte Lt","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Pupil size behavior during on line processing of sentences","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pupil-size-behavior-during-line-processing-sentences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":3690741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4468685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242622,"mean":13.682829417074,"rank":109925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":129109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242622,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":5.7112571428571,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
