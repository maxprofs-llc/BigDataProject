In particular, MMP2 has recently been recognized as an important biomarker for lung cancer. Despite the important role of detecting MMP molecules in cancer diagnosis, it is a daunting task to quantitatively understand a correlation between the status of cancer development and the secretion level of MMP in a blood droplet. Here, we demonstrate a nanoscale cancer diagnosis by nanomechanical quantitation of MMP2 molecules under cancer progression with using a blood droplet of lung cancer patients. Specifically, we measured the frequency dynamics of nanomechanical biosensor functionalized with peptide chains mimicking ECM in response to MMP2 secreted from tumors in lung with different metastasis level. It is shown that the frequency shift of the biosensor, which exhibits the detection sensitivity below 1 nM, enables the quantitation of the secretion level of MMP2 molecules during the progression of cancer cells or tumor growth. More importantly, using a blood droplet of lung cancer patients, nanomechanical biosensor is shown to be capable of depicting the correlation between the secretion level of MMP2 molecules and the level of cancer metastasis, which highlights the cantilever-based MMP2 detection for diagnosis of lung cancer. Our finding will broaden the understanding of cancer development activated by MMP and allow for a fast and point-of-care cancer diagnostics.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc86","authors":["Jin Woo Choi","Hyungbeen Lee","Gyudo Lee","Yi Rang Kim","Myung-Ju Ahn","Heung Jae Park","Kilho Eom","Taeyun Kwon"],"doi":"10.7150\/thno.19358","first_seen_on":"2017-08-22T13:51:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1838-7640"],"issue":"11","journal":"Theranostics","last_mentioned_on":1503409865,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28824722?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5562222","pmid":"28824722","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","nanotechnology","diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Blood Droplet-Based Cancer Diagnosis via Proteolytic Activity Measurement in Cancer Progression","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":7272158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168169,"mean":12.704972729651,"rank":137822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168169,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":2.8041724137931,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BiosensorPapers\/statuses\/899992321759920128","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24180788],"posted_on":"2017-08-22T13:51:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Biosensor Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/706647650213363712\/BpK5-z3e_normal.jpg","description":"Pubmed Twitterbot for #biosensor papers.
