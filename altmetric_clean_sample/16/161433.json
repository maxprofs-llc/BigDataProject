Administration of this peptide to NOD mice prevents diabetes, and phase I trials of an altered peptide ligand of B:9-23 are underway in humans. We were interested in long-term subcutaneous therapeutic administration of B:9-23 without adjuvant. To our initial surprise, the peptide consistently induced fatal anaphylaxis in NOD mice after 6 weeks of administration. Anaphylaxis could be blocked by a combination of antihistamine and platelet-activating factor antagonist (but neither alone) or by a combination of anti-IgG receptor and anti-IgE antibodies. High titers of anti-B:9-23 antibodies were induced within 3-4 weeks of immunization with the peptide. Peptide B:13-23 also induced anaphylaxis and was more potent than peptide B:9-23. Antibodies induced by peptide B:9-23 and peptide B:13-23 did not cross-react with each other. Thus, the insulin peptides B:9-23 and B:13-23, even when administered subcutaneously in the absence of adjuvant, can induce a dramatic humoral response leading to fatal anaphylaxis in NOD mice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["Liu, Edwin","Moriyama, Hiroaki","Abiru, Norio","Miao, Dongmei","Yu, Liping","Taylor, Robert M","Finkelman, Fred D","Eisenbarth, George S","Edwin Liu","Hiroaki Moriyama","Norio Abiru","Dongmei Miao","Liping Yu","Robert M.
