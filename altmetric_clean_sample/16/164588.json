It is well established that protective immunity against liver stages of malaria parasites is primarily mediated by CD8(+) T cells in mice. Activation of natural killer T (NKT) cells by the glycolipid ligand, alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), causes bystander activation of NK, B, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells. Our study shows that coadministration of alpha-GalCer with suboptimal doses of irradiated sporozoites or recombinant viruses expressing a malaria antigen greatly enhances the level of protective anti-malaria immunity in mice. We also show that coadministration of alpha-GalCer with various different immunogens strongly enhances antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses, and to a lesser degree, Th1-type responses. The adjuvant effects of alpha-GalCer require CD1d molecules, Valpha14 NKT cells, and interferon gamma. As alpha-GalCer stimulates both human and murine NKT cells, these findings should contribute to the design of more effective vaccines against malaria and other intracellular pathogens, as well as tumors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Gonzalez-Aseguinolaza, Gloria","Van Kaer, Luc","Bergmann, Cornelia C","Wilson, James M","Schmieg, John","Kronenberg, Mitchell","Nakayama, Toshinori","Taniguchi, Masaru","Koezuka, Yasuhiko","Tsuji, Moriya"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.20011889","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0022-1007","1540-9538"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1412777303,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11877484","http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/195\/5\/617.long"],"pmcid":"PMC2193764","pmid":"11877484","pubdate":"2002-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Natural Killer T Cell Ligand \u03b1-Galactosylceramide Enhances Protective Immunity Induced by Malaria Vaccines","type":"article","volume":"195","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/natural-killer-t-cell-ligand-%CE%B1galactosylceramide-enhances-protective-immunity-induced-malaria-vaccin-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2921807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1436346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3442448,"mean":5.7871783644581,"rank":2280519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1059741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3442448,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2983,"mean":3.8044493628437,"rank":2482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2983,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2215,"mean":4.0279448961156,"rank":1865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2215,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
