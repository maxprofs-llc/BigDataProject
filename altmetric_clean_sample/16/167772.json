At low ATP concentrations, the motor rotates in discrete 120 degrees steps, consistent with sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three beta-subunits. The mechanism of stepping is unknown. Here we show by high-speed imaging that the 120 degrees step consists of roughly 90 degrees and 30 degrees substeps, each taking only a fraction of a millisecond. ATP binding drives the 90 degrees substep, and the 30 degrees substep is probably driven by release of a hydrolysis product. The two substeps are separated by two reactions of about 1 ms, which together occupy most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. This scheme probably applies to rotation at full speed ( approximately 130 revolutions per second at saturating ATP) down to occasional stepping at nanomolar ATP concentrations, and supports the binding-change model for ATP synthesis by reverse rotation of F1-ATPase.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001Natur.410..898Y","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Ryohei Yasuda","Hiroyuki Noji","Masasuke Yoshida","Kazuhiko Kinosita","Hiroyasu Itoh"],"doi":"10.1038\/35073513","endpage":"904","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-0836"],"issue":"6831","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1368615760,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11309608","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v410\/n6831\/full\/410898a0.html"],"pmid":"11309608","pubdate":"2001-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"898","subjects":["science"],"title":"Resolution of distinct rotational substeps by submillisecond kinetic analysis of F1-ATPase","type":"article","volume":"410","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resolution-distinct-rotational-substeps-submillisecond-kinetic-analysis-f1atpase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":213613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":3411632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726698,"mean":5.226826652176,"rank":175164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2548685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726698,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34744,"mean":41.349267305644,"rank":12436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":22189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34744,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33602,"mean":38.694835987024,"rank":11675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":21811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33602,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":24,"Researcher":69,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
