Because the cell and its adhesive components are subject to external perturbation from the surrounding flow of blood, it is important to understand the binding properties of the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 interaction in both steady state and in the presence of an external pulling force. Here we report on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the unbinding of LFA-1 from ICAM-1. The single molecule measurements revealed the energy landscape corresponding to the dissociation of the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 complex and provided the basis for defining the energetic determinants of the complex at equilibrium and under the influence of an external force. The AFM force measurements were performed in an experimental system consisting of an LFA-1-expressing T cell hybridoma, 3A9, attached to the end of the AFM cantilever and an apposing surface expressing ICAM-1. In measurements covering three orders of magnitude change in force loading rate, the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 force spectrum (i.e., unbinding force versus loading rate) revealed a fast and a slow loading regime that characterized a steep inner activation barrier and a wide outer activation barrier, respectively. The addition of Mg(2+), a cofactor that stabilizes the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 interaction, elevated the unbinding force of the complex in the slow loading regime. In contrast, the presence of EDTA suppressed the inner barrier of the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 complex. These results suggest that the equilibrium dissociation constant of the LFA-1\/ICAM-1 interaction is regulated by the energetics of the outer activation barrier of the complex, while the ability of the complex to resist a pulling force is determined by the divalent cation-dependent inner activation barrier.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2002BpJ....83.2270Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c89","authors":["Zhang, Xiaohui","Wojcikiewicz, Ewa","Moy, Vincent T"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-3495(02)73987-8","issns":["0006-3495"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biophysical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1033344000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12324444","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0006-3495(02)73987-8"],"pmcid":"PMC1302315","pmid":"12324444","pubdate":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics"],"title":"Force Spectroscopy of the Leukocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1\/Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 Interaction","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/force-spectroscopy-leukocyte-functionassociated-antigen1intercellular-adhesion-molecule1-interaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4358064,"mean":4.8782278224232,"rank":2364293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1263687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4358064,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3319409,"mean":5.4353121855834,"rank":1795694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":974524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3319409,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2013,"mean":2.7227445328032,"rank":894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2013,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1461,"mean":2.5866684931507,"rank":533,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":484,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1461,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
