We used mass spectrometry phosphopeptide mapping to show that the tail of myosin-V was phosphorylated in mitotic Xenopus egg extract on a single serine residue localized in the carboxyl-terminal organelle-binding domain. Phosphorylation resulted in the release of the motor from the organelle. The phosphorylation site matched the consensus sequence of calcium\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and inhibitors of CaMKII prevented myosin-V release. The modulation of cargo binding by phosphorylation is likely to represent a general mechanism regulating organelle transport by myosin-V.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001Sci...293.1317K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Karcher, R L","Roland, J T","Zappacosta, F","Huddleston, M J","Annan, R S","Carr, S A","Gelfand, V I"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1061086","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"5533","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1003449600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11509731"],"pmid":"11509731","pubdate":"2001-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Cell cycle regulation of myosin-V by calcium\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.","type":"article","volume":"293","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-cycle-regulation-myosinv-calciumcalmodulindependent-protein-kinase-ii-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729795,"mean":5.2111768111477,"rank":1475534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729795,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27897,"mean":20.967528462862,"rank":22400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27897,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23305,"mean":24.080426965328,"rank":18214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":2818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23305,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1000762","license":"public","citation_ids":[167192],"posted_on":"2001-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
