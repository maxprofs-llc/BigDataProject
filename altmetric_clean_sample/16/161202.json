Indeed, NK cell apoptosis elicited by either putative HLA-E and HLA-F (sHLA-I non-A, -B, -C, and -G) or sHLA-I-Cw4 or -Cw3 from untransfected or -Cw4 or -Cw3 alleles transfected HLA-A(-), B(-), C(-), G(-), E(+), F(+) 721.221 lymphoblastoid cell line, respectively, was blocked by covering the corresponding activating receptor with either anti-CLIR- or anti-KIR-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). After sHLA-I-activating receptor interaction, NK cells produced and released Fas ligand (FasL), which in turn led to NK cell apoptosis by interacting with Fas at the NK cell surface. Blocking anti-Fas mAb, or anti-FasL mAb, inhibited sHLA-I-mediated apoptosis via activating receptor in NK cell clones. This apoptosis was inhibited by NK cell treatment with cyclosporin A, whereas this drug had no effect on activating receptor-mediated activation of cytolysis. Conversely, concanamycin A, an inhibitor of vacuolar type H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) of granules, inhibited activating receptor-induced NK cell cytolysis, suggesting that activating receptor-mediated apoptosis and cytolysis can use different intracellular pathways. Furthermore, a large amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was detectable in culture supernatant of activating receptor(+) NK cells incubated with the appropriate sHLA-I ligand. Again, cyclosporin A, but not concanamycin A, strongly reduced activating receptor-mediated IFN-gamma production. This suggests that activating receptor-induced apoptosis of NK cells could play a role in eliminating potentially harmful NK cell clones and, at the same time, it leads to production of IFN-gamma, an antiviral cytokine able to amplify immune responses.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Spaggiari, Grazia Maria","Contini, Paola","Dondero, Alessandra","Carosio, Roberta","Puppo, Francesco","Indiveri, Francesco","Zocchi, Maria Raffaella","Poggi, Alessandro"],"doi":"10.1182\/blood-2002-04-1284","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0006-4971"],"issue":"12","journal":"Blood","last_mentioned_on":1041984000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12393468"],"pmid":"12393468","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Soluble HLA class I induces NK cell apoptosis upon the engagement of killer-activating HLA class I receptors through FasL-Fas interaction.","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/soluble-hla-class-i-induces-nk-cell-apoptosis-upon-engagement-killeractivating-hla-class-i-receptors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3931240,"mean":5.0178617752325,"rank":2186283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1017973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3931240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2967676,"mean":5.4982696468218,"rank":1623655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":801690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2967676,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7308,"mean":2.7918526834611,"rank":3748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":2200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7308,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5733,"mean":2.8279005061965,"rank":2668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5733,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
