Here we report an absolute requirement for BAFF in normal B cell development. Examination of secondary lymphoid organs from BAFF-deficient mice revealed an almost complete loss of follicular and marginal zone B lymphocytes. In contrast, mice lacking BCMA had normal-appearing B lymphocyte compartments. BAFF therefore plays a crucial role in B cell development and can function through receptors other than BCMA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001Sci...293.2111S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Schiemann, B","Gommerman, J L","Vora, K","Cachero, T G","Shulga-Morskaya, S","Dobles, M","Frew, E","Scott, M L"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1061964","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0036-8075"],"issue":"5537","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1006473600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11509691"],"pmid":"11509691","pubdate":"2001-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"An essential role for BAFF in the normal development of B cells through a BCMA-independent pathway.","type":"article","volume":"293","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/essential-role-baff-normal-development-b-cells-through-bcmaindependent-pathway"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629407,"mean":4.9349111287126,"rank":2016204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":939478,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629407,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727361,"mean":5.2214700413621,"rank":1476448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":744099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727361,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27894,"mean":21.001945649446,"rank":22418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":3163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27894,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23301,"mean":24.114946437768,"rank":18227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23301,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":31,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Student  > Ph.
