[J Med Microbiol. 2011] - PubMed result"],"citation":{"abstract":"The genetic characteristics of mumps virus (MuV) strains isolated from sporadic mumps cases between 2007 and 2009 in three provinces of south-west China were investigated. MuV detection was carried out by nested RT-PCR on 117 cases. The small hydrophobic gene of 33 isolated strains was identified, and sequence analysis revealed that all the isolates belonged to the lineage genotype F with slight nucleotide variation. Furthermore, the virus haemagglutinin-neuraminidase and nucleoprotein antigens exhibited a high degree of nucleotide and amino acid similarity (>99\u200a%) within all isolates, whilst the fusion protein appeared to have certain geographical differences. This study on molecular surveillance will help to monitor the circulation of MuV in China.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Haijing Shi","Longding Liu","Shaohui Ma","Junying Chen","Yanchun Che","Jingjing Wang","Qihan Li"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.021907-0","issns":["1473-5644"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1308404799,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21680769"],"pmid":"21680769","pubdate":"2011-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Molecular epidemiology of Mumps Viral Strains Circulating in Southwest China from 2007 to 2009.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-epidemiology-mumps-virus-strains-circulating-southwest-china-2007-2009"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":3111331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1006240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441625,"mean":5.7490664439459,"rank":2399412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":761554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441625,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":606,"mean":2.1681553719008,"rank":364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":606,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":413,"mean":2.3251019417476,"rank":243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":413,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Makoto_Takeda\/status\/82081796161945601","citation_ids":[168289],"posted_on":"2011-06-18T13:46:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Makoto Takeda","url":"http:\/\/mta049.p2.bindsite.jp\/index.html","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1847080126\/takeda_normal.jpg","description":"\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u5b66\u8005\uff08virologist\uff09\r\n\u5c02\u9580\uff1a\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u5b66 (virology)\u3001\u611f\u67d3\u75c7 (infectious diseases)\r\n\u30ad\u30fc\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\uff1a\u9ebb\u3057\u3093 (measles)\u3001\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30eb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b6 (influenza)\u3001\u98a8\u3057\u3093 (rubella)\u3001\u547c\u5438\u5668\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u3001\u304a\u305f\u3075\u304f\u98a8\u90aa (mumps)\u3001\u30ef\u30af\u30c1\u30f3(vaccine)","id_on_source":"makoto_takeda","tweeter_id":"139368886","geo":{"lt":28.161759,"ln":145.02816,"country":"JP"},"followers":41},"tweet_id":"82081796161945601"}]}}
