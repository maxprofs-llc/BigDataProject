In mice, a left right bias is thought to arise from a directional extracellular flow (nodal flow) that is generated by dynein-dependent rotation of monocilia on the ventral surface of the embryonic node. Here we show that the existence of node monocilia and the expression of a dynein gene that is implicated in ciliary function are conserved across a wide range of vertebrate classes, indicating that a similar ciliary mechanism may underlie the establishment of handedness in all vertebrates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Essner, Jeffrey J","Vogan, Kyle J","Wagner, Molly K","Tabin, Clifford J","Yost, H Joseph","Brueckner, Martina"],"doi":"10.1038\/418037a","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-0836"],"issue":"6893","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1031011200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12097899"],"pmid":"12097899","pubdate":"2002-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Conserved function for embryonic nodal cilia.","type":"article","volume":"418","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leftright-development-conserved-function-embryonic-nodal-cilia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":2016979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936814,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726727,"mean":5.2263015455195,"rank":1477074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":741938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726727,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34744,"mean":41.347314624529,"rank":29508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34744,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33602,"mean":38.693306746823,"rank":28434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":2408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33602,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":34,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
