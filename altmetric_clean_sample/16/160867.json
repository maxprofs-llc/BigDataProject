The 2' OH of this adenosine, called the branch site, brings about nucleophilic attack at the pre-mRNA 5' splice site in the first step of splicing. Another feature of this pairing is the phylogenetic conservation of a pseudouridine (psi) residue in U2 snRNA nearly opposite the branch site. We show that the presence of this psi in the pre-mRNA branch-site helix of Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces a dramatically altered architectural landscape compared with that of its unmodified counterpart. The psi-induced structure places the nucleophile in an accessible position for the first step of splicing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316f","authors":["Newby, Meredith I","Greenbaum, Nancy L"],"doi":"10.1038\/nsb873","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1072-8368","1545-9993","1545-9985"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nature Structural & Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1418359730,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12426583","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nsmb\/journal\/v9\/n12\/full\/nsb873.html"],"pmid":"12426583","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Sculpting of the spliceosomal branch site recognition motif by a conserved pseudouridine","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sculpting-spliceosomal-branch-site-recognition-motif-conserved-pseudouridine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4612582,"mean":5.4149131655012,"rank":908300,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3674853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4612582,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3524940,"mean":6.134896937764,"rank":775235,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":2722725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3524940,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1649,"mean":6.1956796116505,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1649,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1640,"mean":6.2076705308115,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1640,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
