Studies do not demonstrate benefit from doubling the dose of an ICS in asthma"],"citation":{"abstract":"Two recent trials from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's asthma clinical trials networks raise a concern about using double the dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as a positive control arm in clinical trials of add-on therapy. The literature evaluating the response to doubling the dose of an ICS is briefly reviewed. The vast majority of studies do not demonstrate a significant positive benefit from doubling the dose of an ICS but do show improvement with 4-fold increases that is equal to or greater than that of add-on long-acting bronchodilators. It is recommended that doubling the dose of an ICS no longer be considered a positive comparator arm in clinical trials, although it might be beneficial in individual patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b59","authors":["H William Kelly"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaci.2011.05.002","issns":["1097-6825"],"journal":"The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1308412805,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21621831?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21621831","pubdate":"2011-05-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Inhaled corticosteroid dosing: Double for nothing?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhaled-corticosteroid-dosing-double-nothing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506214,"mean":5.1186469373082,"rank":3107961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":992654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506214,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441775,"mean":5.759682929703,"rank":2399331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":748314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441775,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3220,"mean":6.3410034172103,"rank":2606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3220,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726,"mean":6.792607706422,"rank":2257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1,"TN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/Allergy\/status\/82115372140077056","citation_ids":[168404],"posted_on":"2011-06-18T16:00:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Ves Dimov, M.D.","url":"http:\/\/allergynotes.blogspot.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/292966342\/AB1_normal.png","description":"Allergist\/Immunologist at Cleveland Clinic.
