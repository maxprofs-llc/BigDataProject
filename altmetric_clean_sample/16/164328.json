We previously showed that apoptosis is associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) in Pax-3-deficient Splotch (Sp\/Sp) embryos. Here we show that p53 deficiency, caused by germ-line mutation or by pifithrin-alpha, an inhibitor of p53-dependent apoptosis, rescues not only apoptosis, but also NTDs, in Sp\/Sp embryos. Pax-3 deficiency had no effect on p53 mRNA, but increased p53 protein levels. These results suggest that Pax-3 regulates neural tube closure by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis, rather than by inducing neural tube-specific gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Pani, Lydie","Horal, Melissa","Loeken, Mary R"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.969302","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0890-9369"],"issue":"6","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1369410642,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11914272"],"pmcid":"PMC155364","pmid":"11914272","pubdate":"2002-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Rescue of neural tube defects in Pax-3-deficient embryos by p53 loss of function: implications for Pax-3- dependent development and tumorigenesis.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rescue-neural-tube-defects-pax3deficient-embryos-p53-loss-function-implications-pax3dependent-develo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":1993472,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2418335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3442079,"mean":5.7703689824526,"rank":1566668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1803485,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3442079,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2769,"mean":3.1232911849711,"rank":1377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2769,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1984,"mean":3.2105799293999,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1984,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
