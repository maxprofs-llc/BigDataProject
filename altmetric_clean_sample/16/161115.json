We inhibited PCM-1 function using a variety of approaches: microinjection of antibodies into cultured cells, overexpression of a PCM-1 deletion mutant, and specific depletion of PCM-1 by siRNA. All approaches led to reduced targeting of centrin, pericentrin, and ninein to the centrosome. Similar effects were seen upon inhibition of dynactin by dynamitin, and after prolonged treatment of cells with the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. Inhibition or depletion of PCM-1 function further disrupted the radial organization of microtubules without affecting microtubule nucleation. Loss of microtubule organization was also observed after centrin or ninein depletion. Our data suggest that PCM-1-containing centriolar satellites are involved in the microtubule- and dynactin-dependent recruitment of proteins to the centrosome, of which centrin and ninein are required for interphase microtubule organization.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Dammermann, Alexander","Merdes, Andreas"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200204023","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9525"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1198022850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12403812","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2173044"],"pmcid":"PMC2173044","pmid":"12403812","pubdate":"2002-10-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Assembly of centrosomal proteins and microtubule organization depends on PCM-1","type":"article","volume":"159","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assembly-centrosomal-proteins-microtubule-organization-depends-pcm1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":680502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2926779,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728423,"mean":5.215713683591,"rank":553840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2153468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728423,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4071,"mean":3.25057002457,"rank":528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4071,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":2.9329404958678,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":47,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
