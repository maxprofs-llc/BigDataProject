These sequences are designated as long direct repeat (LDR) sequences. Three of the repeats (LDR-A, -B, -C), each approximately 500 bp in length, are located as tandem repeats at 27.4 min on the genetic map. Another copy (LDR-D), 450 bp in length and nearly identical to LDR-A, -B and -C, is located at 79.7 min, a position that is directly opposite the position of LDR-A, -B and -C. In this study, we demonstrate that LDR-D encodes a 35-amino-acid peptide, LdrD, the overexpression of which causes rapid cell killing and nucleoid condensation of the host cell. Northern blot and primer extension analysis showed constitutive transcription of a stable mRNA (approximately 370 nucleotides) encoding LdrD and an unstable cis-encoded antisense RNA (approximately 60 nucleotides), which functions as a trans-acting regulator of ldrD translation. We propose that LDR encodes a toxin-antitoxin module. LDR-homologous sequences are not pre-sent on any known plasmids but are conserved in Salmonella and other enterobacterial species.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["Kawano, Mitsuoki","Oshima, Taku","Kasai, Hiroaki","Mori, Hirotada"],"isbns":[],"issns":["0950-382X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1281967274,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12123448"],"pmid":"12123448","pubdate":"2002-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Molecular characterization of long direct repeat (LDR) sequences expressing a stable mRNA encoding for a 35-amino-acid cell-killing peptide and a cis-encoded small antisense RNA in Escherichia coli.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-characterization-long-direct-repeat-ldr-sequences-expressing-stable-mrna-encoding-35aminoa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3791530,"mean":5.0045751468638,"rank":866776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2400768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3791530,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2851759,"mean":5.4409419859631,"rank":706889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1792029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2851759,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1922,"mean":2.3641811556481,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1055,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1922,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1758,"mean":2.3503380762664,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1758,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":16,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
