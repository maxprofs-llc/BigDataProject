The discovery that synthetic double-stranded, 21-nt small interfering RNA triggers gene-specific silencing in mammalian cells has further expanded the utility of RNAi into mammalian systems. Here we report a technology that allows synthesis of small interfering RNAs from DNA templates in vivo to efficiently inhibit endogenous gene expression. Significantly, we were able to use this approach to demonstrate, in multiple cell lines, robust inhibition of several endogenous genes of diverse functions. These findings highlight the general utility of this DNA vector-based RNAi technology in suppressing gene expression in mammalian cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2002PNAS...99.5515S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Sui, Guangchao","Soohoo, Christina","Affar, El Bachir","Gay, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique","Shi, Yujiang","Forrester, William C","Shi, Yang"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.082117599","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"8","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1374596875,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11960009"],"pmcid":"PMC122801","pmid":"11960009","pubdate":"2002-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A DNA vector-based RNAi technology to suppress gene expression in mammalian cells.","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-vectorbased-rnai-technology-suppress-gene-expression-mammalian-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616176,"mean":4.9318698536468,"rank":1808404,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1631927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616176,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2714992,"mean":5.1669640967524,"rank":1325304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":1264600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2714992,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33558,"mean":13.688858956403,"rank":22269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33558,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26590,"mean":16.49476482756,"rank":16075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":9639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26590,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":40,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":86,"Student  > Ph.
