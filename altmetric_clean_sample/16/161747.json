Coexpression of mammalian beta-cat with TCF4 or LEF1 results in nuclear accumulation of these proteins and a functional complex that activates reporter gene transcription from constructs containing leukocyte enhancer factor (LEF)\/T cell factor (TCF) response elements. Reporter transcription is constitutive, requires expression of both beta-cat and TCF4 or LEF1, and is not supported by mutated LEF\/TCF binding elements or by TCF4 or LEF1 mutants. A cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin or a functional fragment of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein (APC-25) complexes with beta-cat, reduces beta-cat binding to TCF4, and leads to increased cytoplasmic localization of beta-cat and a reduction in reporter activation. Systematic mutation of putative nuclear export signal sequences in APC-25 decreases APC-25 binding to beta-cat and restores reporter gene transcription. Additional beta-cat signaling components, Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, form a multisubunit complex similar to that found in mammalian cells. Coexpression of the F-box protein beta-transducin repeat-containing protein reduces the stability of beta-cat and decreases reporter activation. Thus, we have reconstituted a functional beta-cat signal transduction pathway in yeast and show that beta-cat signaling can be regulated at multiple levels, including protein subcellular localization, protein complex formation, and protein stability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002ce3","authors":["Lee, Margaret S","D'Amour, Karen A","Papkoff, Jackie"],"doi":"10.1083\/jcb.200204063","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9525"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1033430400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12235124"],"pmcid":"PMC2173206","pmid":"12235124","pubdate":"2002-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Rockefeller University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"A yeast model system for functional analysis of beta-catenin signaling.","type":"article","volume":"158","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yeast-model-system-functional-analysis-betacatenin-signaling-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626596,"mean":4.9527436744422,"rank":2018825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626596,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2724663,"mean":5.2352877068812,"rank":1478004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":737003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2724663,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4070,"mean":3.262165642664,"rank":2395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4070,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":2.946941322314,"rank":945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1009631","license":"public","citation_ids":[161747],"posted_on":"2002-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["technical_advance"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
