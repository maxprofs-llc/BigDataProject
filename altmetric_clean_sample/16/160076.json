Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanism of their development. Here we show that Foxp3, which encodes a transcription factor that is genetically defective in an autoimmune and inflammatory syndrome in humans and mice, is specifically expressed in naturally arising CD4+ regulatory T cells. Furthermore, retroviral gene transfer of Foxp3 converts na\u00efve T cells toward a regulatory T cell phenotype similar to that of naturally occurring CD4+ regulatory T cells. Thus, Foxp3 is a key regulatory gene for the development of regulatory T cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2003Sci...299.1057H","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["Shohei Hori","Takashi Nomura","Shimon Sakaguchi"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.1079490","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1095-9203"],"issue":"5609","journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1430466937,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12522256","http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/299\/5609\/1057.short"],"pmid":"12522256","pubdate":"2003-02-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Control of Regulatory T Cell Development by the Transcription Factor Foxp3","type":"article","volume":"299","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-regulatory-t-cell-development-transcription-factor-foxp3-25"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5045059,"mean":5.9752439706371,"rank":944836,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4077285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5045059,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4059426,"mean":6.7292684013158,"rank":847244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":3192414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4059426,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32347,"mean":27.427598404749,"rank":15962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":16192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32347,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29106,"mean":30.024139632366,"rank":15803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":13116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29106,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
