We have deduced the genomic structure of this complex locus and found that at least seven of the mod(mdg4) isoforms are encoded on both of its antiparallel DNA strands, suggesting the generation of mature mRNAs by trans-splicing. In transgenic assays, we demonstrate the ability of Drosophila to produce mod(mdg4) mRNAs by trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs generated from transgenes inserted at distant chromosomal positions. Furthermore, evidence is presented for occurring of trans-splicing of mod(mdg4)-specific exons encoded by the parallel DNA strand. The mod(mdg4) locus represents a new type of complex gene structure in which genetic complexity is resolved by extensive trans-splicing, giving important implications for genome sequencing projects. Demonstration of naturally occurring trans-splicing in the model organism Drosophila opens new experimental approaches toward an analysis of the underlying mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2001PNAS...98.9724D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Dorn, R","Reuter, G","Loewendorf, A"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.151268698","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"17","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1003708800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11493677"],"pmcid":"PMC55520","pmid":"11493677","pubdate":"2001-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Transgene analysis proves mRNA trans-splicing at the complex mod(mdg4) locus in Drosophila.","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transgene-analysis-proves-mrna-transsplicing-complex-modmdg4-locus-drosophila"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":2015210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":946847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2729904,"mean":5.2109900945236,"rank":1475519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":749686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2729904,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33625,"mean":13.605935284321,"rank":23211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":4512,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33625,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26624,"mean":16.401814220787,"rank":17027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":3773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26624,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
