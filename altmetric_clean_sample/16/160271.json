Phenylalanine and tryptophan are first deaminated (to 3-phenylpyruvate and 3-indolepyruvate, respectively) and then decarboxylated. This decarboxylation can be effected by any of Pdc1p, Pdc5p, Pdc6p, or Ydr380wp; Ydl080cp has no role in the catabolism of either amino acid. We also report that in leucine catabolism Ydr380wp is the minor decarboxylase. Hence, all amino acid catabolic pathways studied to date use a subtly different spectrum of decarboxylases from the five-membered family that comprises Pdc1p, Pdc5p, Pdc6p, Ydl080cp, and Ydr380wp. Using strains containing all possible combinations of mutations affecting the seven AAD genes (putative aryl alcohol dehydrogenases), five ADH genes, and SFA1, showed that the final step of amino acid catabolism (conversion of an aldehyde to a long chain or complex alcohol) can be accomplished by any one of the ethanol dehydrogenases (Adh1p, Adh2p, Adh3p, Adh4p, Adh5p) or by Sfa1p (formaldehyde dehydrogenase.)","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Dickinson, J Richard","Salgado, L Eshantha J","Hewlins, Michael J E"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m211914200","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1376856667,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12499363"],"pmid":"12499363","pubdate":"2003-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The catabolism of amino acids to long chain and complex alcohols in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/catabolism-amino-acids-long-chain-complex-alcohols-saccharomyces-cerevisiae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":681064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2931398,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2732024,"mean":5.2131693210521,"rank":554517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2156387,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2732024,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28045,"mean":2.6412116673798,"rank":1066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":26530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28045,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14799,"mean":2.5066700905528,"rank":914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":13461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14799,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
