The structures provide a framework for understanding sigma(70)-(RNA polymerase core), sigma(70)-DNA, and sigma(70)-RNA interactions. The positions of sigma(70) regions 1.2, 2, 3, and 4 are similar in holoenzyme and open complex. In contrast, the position of sigma(70) region 1.1 differs dramatically in holoenzyme and open complex. In holoenzyme, region 1.1 is located within the active-center cleft, apparently serving as a \"molecular mimic\" of DNA, but, in open complex, region 1.1 is located outside the active center cleft. The approach described here should be applicable to the analysis of other nanometer-scale complexes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c1","authors":["Mekler, Vladimir","Kortkhonjia, Ekaterine","Mukhopadhyay, Jayanta","Knight, Jennifer","Revyakin, Andrei","Kapanidis, Achillefs N","Niu, Wei","Ebright, Yon W","Levy, Ronald","Ebright, Richard H"],"issns":["0092-8674"],"issue":"5","journal":"Cell","last_mentioned_on":1485871193,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11893332","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11893332"],"pmid":"11893332","pubdate":"2002-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Structural organization of bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex.","type":"article","volume":"108","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-organization-bacterial-rna-polymerase-holoenzyme-rna-polymerasepromoter-open-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8156965,"mean":6.8933631772734,"rank":2061466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4966223,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8156965,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529507,"mean":7.2135849169854,"rank":1965172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4559970,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529507,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":24.974183577003,"rank":4570,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8354,"mean":26.689224230815,"rank":4424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8354,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
