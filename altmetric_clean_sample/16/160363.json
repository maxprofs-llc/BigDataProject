In addition to being interconnected via homologous gap junctions, these cells make extensive heterologous gap junctions with ON-cone bipolar cells (BCs). These gap junctions are the pathway for transfer of rod signals to the ON-system. To investigate the functional properties of these gap junctions, we performed simultaneous whole-cell recordings from pairs of AII amacrine cells and ON-cone bipolar cells in the in vitro slice preparation of the rat retina. We demonstrate strong electrical coupling with symmetrical junction conductance (approximately 1.2 nS) and very low steady-state voltage sensitivity. However, signal transmission is more effective in the direction from AII amacrine cells to ON-cone bipolar cells than in the other direction. This functional rectification can be explained by a corresponding difference in membrane input resistance between the two cell types. Signal transmission has low-pass filter characteristics with increasing attenuation and phase shift for increasing stimulus frequency. Action potentials in AII amacrine cells evoke distinct electrical postsynaptic potentials in ON-cone bipolar cells. Strong and temporally precise synchronization of subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations are commonly observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Veruki, Margaret Lin","Hartveit, Espen"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"24","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1299672161,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12486148","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/cgi\/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12486148"],"pmid":"12486148","pubdate":"2002-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Electrical Synapses Mediate Signal Transmission in the Rod Pathway of the Mammalian Retina","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrical-synapses-mediate-signal-transmission-rod-pathway-mammalian-retina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627916,"mean":4.9454584244709,"rank":817426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287279,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627916,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726237,"mean":5.230512700297,"rank":657859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1716332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726237,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9098,"mean":6.1289345938221,"rank":2577,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9098,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8455,"mean":6.3418663354625,"rank":2550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":5373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8455,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":21,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
