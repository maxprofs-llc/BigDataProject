Our objective was to determine the changes in BMI in Australian Aboriginal children relative to non-Aboriginal children as they move through adolescence into young adulthood, and to identify risk factors for higher BMI.\nA prospective cohort study of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal school children commenced in 2002 across 15 different screening areas across urban, regional and remote New South Wales, Australia. Socio-economic status was recorded at study enrolment and participants' BMI was measured every 2 years. We fitted a series of mixed linear regression models adjusting for age, birth weight and socioeconomic status for boys and girls.\n3418 (1949 Aboriginal) participants were screened over a total of 11,387 participant years of follow up. The prevalence of obesity was higher among Aboriginal children from mean age 11 years at baseline (11.6 vs 7.6%) to 16 years at 8 years follow up (18.6 vs 12.3%).The mean BMI increased with age and was significantly higher among Aboriginal girls compared to non-Aboriginal girls (P<0.01). Girls born at low birth weight had a lower BMI than girls born of normal birth weight (P<0.001). Socioeconomic status and low birth weight had a differential effect on BMI for Aboriginal boys compared to non-Aboriginal boys (P for interaction=0.01). Aboriginal boys of highest socioeconomic status, unlike those of lower socioeconomic status, had a higher BMI compared to non-Aboriginal boys. Non-Aboriginal boys of low birth weight were heavier than Aboriginal boys.\nSocioeconomic status and birth weight have differential effects on BMI among Aboriginal boys, and Aboriginal girls had a higher mean BMI than non-Aboriginal girls through childhood and adolescence. Intervention programs need to recognise the differential risk for obesity for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal boys and girls to maximise their impact.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 28 April 2016. doi:10.1038\/ijo.2016.71.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b83","authors":["S Kim","P Macaskill","L A Baur","E M Hodson","J Daylight","R Williams","R Kearns","N Vukasin","D M Lyle","J C Craig"],"doi":"10.1038\/ijo.2016.71","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T12:11:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5497","0307-0565"],"issue":"7","journal":"International Journal of Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1467714347,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/ijo\/rss\/aop\/~3\/_sxu8enLyDc\/ijo.2016.71","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ijo\/journal\/v40\/n7\/abs\/ijo201671a.html?WT.ec_id=IJO-201607&spMailingID=51759273&spUserID=MTc2MzM5ODIzNwS2&spJobID=960599566&spReportId=OTYwNTk5NTY2S0"],"pmid":"27121249","pubdate":"2016-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"The differential effect of socioeconomic status, birth weight and gender on body mass index in Australian Aboriginal children","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-effect-socioeconomic-status-birth-weight-gender-body-mass-index-australian-aboriginal-c-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":6914553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270859,"mean":11.457578258718,"rank":224908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270859,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2351,"mean":15.748438297872,"rank":2240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2351,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":12.9786,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaritaHennessy\/statuses\/750274468484964352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8157777],"posted_on":"2016-07-05T10:25:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Marita Hennessy","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Marita_Hennessy","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896056294246952972\/BEWpvdiE_normal.jpg","description":"@SPHeREprogramme PhD Scholar @hbcrg.
