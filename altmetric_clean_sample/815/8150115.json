Effectiveness was evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) and daily morphine dose with a follow-up of 6-months. Complications were also recorded.\nMean VAS score and morphine dose pre-procedure were 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 (range, 5-10) and 47.7\u2009\u00b1\u200930.1\u00a0mg (range, 20-120\u00a0mg), respectively. Technical success and pain relief were achieved in all patients. Mean VAS scores and daily morphine doses post-procedure were as follows: 48\u00a0h, 1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 29.6\u2009\u00b1\u200916.1\u00a0mg (p\u2009=\u20090.003); 7\u00a0days, 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 16.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0\u00a0mg (p\u2009<\u20090.001); 1\u00a0month, 1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 10.8\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9 (p\u2009<\u20090.001); 3\u00a0months, 0.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 8.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2\u00a0mg (p\u2009<\u20090.001); and 6\u00a0months, 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 9.2\u2009\u00b1\u200912.3\u00a0mg (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Complications were observed in eight patients (28\u00a0%); among these, major complications were reported in two (7.7\u00a0%)\u00a0patients, one with local infection and the other with a bone fracture. The minor complication rate was 23.1\u00a0% (6\/26).\nMWA combination with osteoplasty appeared to be an effective and safe treatment for lung cancer patients with painful extraspinal bone metastases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f610003547","authors":["Wei, Zhigang","Zhang, Kaixian","Ye, Xin","Yang, Xia","Zheng, Aimin","Huang, Guanghui","Wang, Jiao"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00256-015-2195-4","endpage":"1490","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T10:06:54+00:00","issns":["1432-2161","0364-2348"],"issue":"10","journal":"Skeletal Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1464084331,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26112311?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26112311","pubdate":"2015-06-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1485","subjects":["radiology","orthopedics"],"title":"Computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation combined with osteoplasty for palliative treatment of painful extraspinal bone metastases from lung cancer","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computed-tomographyguided-percutaneous-microwave-ablation-combined-osteoplasty-palliative-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":6703185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268948,"mean":11.438136658895,"rank":224102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268948,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":359,"mean":2.4874301675978,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":359,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.51,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
