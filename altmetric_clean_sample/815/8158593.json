Donor sex and age, living donors with biliary and\/or vascular anomalies, recipient age, sex, primary etiology, re-transplantation, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score, co-morbidities, arterial and biliary recipient complications assessed on the basis of clinical follow-up were collected and analyzed for significance through the use of a multivariate linear regression model.\nBiliary complications in the donor (DBC) were detected in 8 (8.2%) cases. Biliary complications in the recipients (RBC) were detected in 38 (39%) cases. DBADs were found in 32 (33%) cases and resulted strictly related to RBC (P\u00a0= .05).\nAfter adjusting for co-variables, results of the linear regression analysis confirmed that DBAD is an independent predictor of RBC, but it is not significantly associated with vascular complications or patient survival. We showed that RBCs after LDLT were influenced by DBAD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003694","authors":["Pagano, D","Cintorino, D","Li Petri, S","Paci, M","Tropea, A","Ricotta, C","Bonsignore, P","Saffioti, M C","Spada, M","Miraglia, R","Gridelli, B G","Gruttadauria, S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.transproceed.2014.11.069","endpage":"2160","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T12:41:32+00:00","issns":["1873-2623","00411345"],"issue":"7","journal":"Transplantation Proceedings","last_mentioned_on":1464097592,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26361667?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26361667","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2159","title":"Intra-Operative Contrast Cholangiography in Living Donor Liver Transplantation: The ISMETT Experience","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraoperative-contrast-cholangiography-living-donor-liver-transplantation-ismett-experience"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":3995732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3724805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268948,"mean":11.438104310514,"rank":144607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":123132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268948,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1143,"mean":1.4107828371278,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1143,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.0611764705882,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HPB_surgery\/statuses\/735088252340707328","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8158593],"posted_on":"2016-05-24T12:41:11+00:00","author":{"name":"HPB_surgery","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/643215676610490368\/deZWut4o_normal.png","description":"HPB focused literature - as its published","id_on_source":"HPB_surgery","tweeter_id":"2581464331","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":371},"tweet_id":"735088252340707328"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TotiCamiolo\/statuses\/735104700811464705","license":"gnip","rt":["HPB_surgery"],"citation_ids":[8158593],"posted_on":"2016-05-24T13:46:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Salvatore Camiolo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/530421973151531009\/jcd7sQfw_normal.jpeg","description":"Sognatore di una Sicilia normale","id_on_source":"TotiCamiolo","tweeter_id":"118058340","geo":{"lt":38.11582,"ln":13.35976,"country":"IT"},"followers":121},"tweet_id":"735104700811464705"}]}}
