Four trihalomethanes (THMs) and nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) were measured from a chlorine-disinfected sample and two aldehydes (i.e., formaldehydes and acetaldehydes) were analyzed after ozonation. Chlorination was effective for total coliform removal with Ct value in the range of 30-60\u00a0mg-min\/L. Over 1.6\u00a0mg\/L of ozone dose and 0.5\u00a0min of the contact time presented sufficient disinfection efficiency. The concentration of THMs increased with longer contact time (24\u00a0h), but that of HAAs showed little change with contact time. The measured concentration of formaldehyde at the ozone dose of 1.6\u00a0mg\/L and the contact time of 9\u00a0min showed the greatest value in this study, approximately 330\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L(-1), from which the corresponding ecotoxicity was determined using an indicator species, Daphnia magna. The ecotoxicity results were consistent with the toxicological features judged by occurrence, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. Both the disinfection efficiency as well as the DBP formation potential should therefore be considered to avoid harmful impacts on aquatic environments when a disinfection method is used for wastewater effluents.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f610006534","authors":["Park, Keun-Young","Choi, Su-Young","Lee, Seung-Hoon","Kweon, Ji-Hyang","Song, Ji-Hyeon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.envpol.2016.04.001","endpage":"321","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T10:16:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6424","02697491"],"journal":"Environmental Pollution","last_mentioned_on":1464084908,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27213572?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27213572","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"314","subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Comparison of formation of disinfection by-products by chlorination and ozonation of wastewater effluents and their toxicity to Daphnia magna","type":"article","volume":"215","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-formation-disinfection-byproducts-chlorination-ozonation-wastewater-effluents-toxicity-da"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":5860927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1044346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268948,"mean":11.438134427972,"rank":187819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268948,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1978,"mean":6.2207486090035,"rank":1378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1978,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174,"mean":8.8477225433526,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
