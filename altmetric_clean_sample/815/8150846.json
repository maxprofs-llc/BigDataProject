LAPTM4B-35 protein was found to be highly expressed in various solid tumors and could be a poor prognosis marker. The functions of LAPTM4B in solid tumors were also explored. It is suggested that LAPTM4B could promote the proliferation of tumor cells, boost invasion and metastasis, resist apoptosis, initiate autophagy and assist drug resistance.Oncogene advance online publication, 23 May 2016; doi:10.1038\/onc.2016.189.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Meng, Y","Wang, L","Chen, D","Chang, Y","Zhang, M","Xu, J-J","Zhou, R","Zhang, Q-Y"],"doi":"10.1038\/onc.2016.189","first_seen_on":"2016-05-24T10:17:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1476-5594"],"journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1464084922,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27212036?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27212036","pubdate":"2016-05-24T22:01:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cancer genetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biomarkers","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"LAPTM4B: an oncogene in various solid tumors and its functions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laptm4b-oncogene-various-solid-tumors-functions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7747098,"mean":6.6307251234818,"rank":6703184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7747098,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268947,"mean":11.438176027901,"rank":224102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268947,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4126,"mean":4.1407490909091,"rank":3790,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4126,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":11.136180451128,"rank":120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":5,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/735051556391788545","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8150846],"posted_on":"2016-05-24T10:15:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
