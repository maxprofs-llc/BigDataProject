It was found that functionalizing at different positions of the BODIPY core resulted in the final dye exhibiting different emission properties in response to aggregation: from aggregation-induced quenching (ACQ) to being AIE active. X-ray crystallographic analysis was thus performed to provide an explanation for these differences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Wu, Jishan","Chua, Minghui","Ni, Yong","Zheng, Bin","Huang, Kuo-Wei","Xu, Jianwei","Garai, Monalisa","Xu, Qnghua","Chua, Ming Hui","Huang, Kuo\u2010Wei","Xu, Qing\u2010Hua"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201500420","endpage":"1634","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T09:36:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1861-471X"],"issue":"8","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1434533751,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201500420\/abstract;jsessionid=3231B584F27584A6AE0FEE8ADE93982E.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201500420\/pdf","pmid":"26043727","pubdate":"2015-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1631","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Towards meso\u2010Ester BODIPYs with Aggregation\u2010Induced Emission Property: the Effect of Substitution Positions","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/towards-mesoester-bodipys-aggregationinduced-emission-properties-effect-substitution-positions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":4722908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":948933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185162,"mean":8.6015028866771,"rank":128271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185162,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1749,"mean":1.2999118993135,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1749,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.5985074626866,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
