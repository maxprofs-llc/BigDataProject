Sixty-three percent were sedentary (<5000 steps\/day) with a median of 3,688 steps\/day (1,866-6,271)]. PA level was similar between hemodialysis patients and those on peritoneal dialysis (3,693 steps [1,896-6,307] vs. 3,320 [1,478-5,926], P\u00a0=\u00a0.33). In hemodialysis patients, PA was lower on dialysis days compared with nondialysis days (2,912 [1,439-5,232] vs. 4,054 [2,136-7,108], respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). PA gradually decreased with age, 57% being sedentary between 50 and 65\u00a0years and 83% of patients after 80\u00a0years. Beyond this age effect, we identified, for the first time, specific phenotypes of patients with lower PA, such as inflammation, cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, obesity, and diabetes. By contrast, previous kidney transplantation and a higher muscle mass were associated with higher PA.\nDialysis patients present a very low level of PA with high sedentary. Acting on patient's modifiable phenotypes may help to increase PA to improve morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa1","authors":["Panaye, Marine","Kolko-Labadens, Anne","Lasseur, Catherine","Paillasseur, Jean-Louis","Guillodo, Marie Paule","Levannier, Martial","Teta, Daniel","Fouque, Denis"],"doi":"10.1053\/j.jrn.2015.04.004","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T13:28:05+00:00","issns":["1532-8503","1051-2276"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of renal nutrition (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1442484803,"links":["http:\/\/www.jrnjournal.org\/article\/S1051-2276%2815%2900087-4\/fulltext","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25304464?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jrnjournal.org\/article\/S1051227615000874\/pdf","pmid":"25304464","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nephrology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Phenotypes influencing low physical activity in maintenance dialysis.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutrition-needs-patients-chronic-kidney-disease-health-care-community-settings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6360727,"mean":5.8381264295938,"rank":4464654,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1661388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6360727,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191306,"mean":8.5315229398082,"rank":124831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":57282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191306,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":2.2346532258065,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.3875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DailyHemo\/status\/610479854023151616","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4177102],"posted_on":"2015-06-15T16:11:54+00:00","author":{"name":"DailyHemo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/780784814127403008\/CNUhG8Wm_normal.jpg","description":"Started dialysis in 1978, tried standard incenter 3x weekly, Daily Short, Every Other Day and currently on Nocturnal Hemodialysis incenter.","id_on_source":"DailyHemo","tweeter_id":"40357900","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1219},"tweet_id":"610479854023151616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/644452879177134080","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4177102],"posted_on":"2015-09-17T10:08:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"644452879177134080"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/statuses\/644454090374643713","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4177102],"posted_on":"2015-09-17T10:13:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":158},"tweet_id":"644454090374643713"}]}}
