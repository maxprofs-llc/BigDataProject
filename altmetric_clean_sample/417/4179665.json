The c-myc proto-oncogene, usually implicated in cell transformation, differentiation and cell-cycle progression also has a central role in some forms of apoptosis. These opposing roles of myc in cell growth and death require that other gene products dictate the outcome of c-Myc expression on a cell. A candidate for such a modifying gene is bcl-2, whose product prolongs cell survival and blocks apoptosis in some systems. Here we demonstrate that Bcl-2 prevents apoptotic death induced by c-Myc, provide a mechanism whereby cells can express c-Myc without undergoing apoptosis, and give a possible explanation for the ability of Bcl-2 to synergize with c-Myc in cell transformation.","ads_id":"1992Natur.359..552B","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Bissonnette, R P","Echeverri, F","Mahboubi, A","Green, D R","Reid P.
