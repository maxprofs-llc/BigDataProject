This paper describes the overall study design, general demographics, and physiological demand of the intervention phase. A control group design consisting of an intervention group (n\u2009=\u200914; age: 70.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 years) and a control group (n\u2009=\u200917; age: 71.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1 years) was utilized in this study. Parameters of interest were measured during pre-, post-, and retention test sessions. During the 12 weeks of intervention, an average of 25.5 days of guided skiing was conducted by each patient. Daily heart rate (HR) profiles and global positioning system data throughout the ski day were recorded. The intervention group completed an average of 3393 vertical meters of downhill skiing, with a total skiing distance of 33.6\u2009km\/day. Average skiing speed was 8.2\u2009m\/s. In the skiing phase, the average physiological load was 75.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.6% of HRmax . Further effects of the 12-week skiing intervention on the tested parameters will be reported in the following papers of this supplementum.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034c5","authors":["K\u00f6sters, A.","P\u00f6tzelsberger, B.","Dela, F.","Dorn, U.","Hofstaedter, T.","Fink, C.","M\u00fcller, E.","K\u00f6sters, A","P\u00f6tzelsberger, B","Dela, F","Dorn, U","Hofstaedter, T","Fink, C","M\u00fcller, E"],"doi":"10.1111\/sms.12459","endpage":"9","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T11:59:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0838"],"issue":"S2","journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports","last_mentioned_on":1458314075,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sms.12459\/abstract;jsessionid=A5D24817E6B1F3887F8E1627C1023197.f01t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26083696?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/sms.12459\/pdf","pmid":"26083696","pubdate":"2015-06-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"3","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Alpine Skiing With total knee ArthroPlasty (ASWAP): study design and intervention","type":"article","volume":"25 Suppl S2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alpine-skiing-total-knee-arthroplasty-aswap-study-design-intervention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"mean":6.4406978049309,"rank":3807018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2074907,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7408484,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223394,"mean":8.0469182919788,"rank":119350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":81898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223394,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1407,"mean":12.396485064011,"rank":1063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1407,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":13.357356321839,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
