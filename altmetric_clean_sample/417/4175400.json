The legume lectin concanavalin A (con A), from Canavalia ensiformis, specifically recognizes the trimannoside core of many complex glycans. We have determined the crystal structure of a con A-trimannoside complex at 2.3-A resolution now describe the trimannoside interaction with conA. All three sugar residues are in well defined difference electron density. The 1,6-linked mannose residue is bound at the previously reported monosaccharide binding site; the other two sugars bind in an extended cleft formed by residues Tyr-12, Pro-13, Asn-14, Thr-15, and Asp-16. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the protein and all three sugar residues. In particular, the 1,3-linked mannose residue makes a strong hydrogen bond with the main chain of the protein. In addition, a water molecule, which is conserved in other con A structures, plays an important role in anchoring the reducing sugar unit to the protein. The complex is further stabilized by van der Waals interactions. The structure provides a rationale for the high affinity of con A for N-linked glycans.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Naismith, J H","Field, R A"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T07:01:10+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1408078780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8557713"],"pmid":"8557713","pubdate":"1996-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Structural basis of trimannoside recognition by concanavalin A.","type":"article","volume":"271","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-basis-trimannoside-recognition-concanavalin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4143246,"mean":5.1110351934502,"rank":965294,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2615291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4143246,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150472,"mean":7.5981063859484,"rank":45081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":102002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150472,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29456,"mean":2.5144712272959,"rank":2019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":12392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29456,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":521,"mean":3.3150346153846,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":521,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
