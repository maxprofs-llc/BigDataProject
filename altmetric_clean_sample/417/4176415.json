Patients with primary orbital abnormality and those without radiologic orbital signs were excluded. Data regarding age and gender distribution, orbital and ocular findings, radiologic findings, and presence of an additional sinonasal disease were analyzed.\nDisorders affecting orbit were categorized into 6 categories. Mean age was 41.25\u200a\u00b1\u200a22.14 (range: 6-88) years and male\u200a:\u200afemale ratio was 23\u200a:\u200a18. Overall, there were 41 patients including 11 patients with mucocele, 9 patients with sinusitis, 7 patients with fibrous dysplasia, 4 patients with nasal polyp, 4 patients with paranasal osteoma, and 6 patients with neoplasm. Major clinical presentation was proptosis in these patients.\nOtolaryngologists should consider the possibility of sinonasal diseases to affect orbit because of vicinity of nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses to orbit. Radiologic imaging is essential to determine the extent, extension, relation with surrounding structures, and initial diagnosis of the disease, and to plan multidisciplinary management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","authors":["Samil, Kahraman Serif","Yasar, Cokkeser","Ercan, Akbay","Hanifi, Bayarogullari","Hilal, Kahraman"],"doi":"10.1097\/scs.0000000000001827","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T10:35:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-3732"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1434537188,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26080260?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26080260","pubdate":"2015-06-17T22:00:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Diseases Affecting Orbit.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nasal-cavity-paranasal-sinus-diseases-affecting-orbit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5207216,"mean":6.1644978826512,"rank":2755120,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1773302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5207216,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182893,"mean":8.4713459637383,"rank":101256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":63680,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182893,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2909,"mean":0.63603645116919,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2438,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2909,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"mean":0.69503311258278,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/status\/611119379720241152","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4176415],"posted_on":"2015-06-17T10:33:08+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"611119379720241152"}]}}
