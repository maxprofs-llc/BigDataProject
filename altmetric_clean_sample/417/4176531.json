All consecutive patients who underwent a DBE with final diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm from 2004 to 2014 in our referral center were included. Patient demographic and clinical pathological characteristics were recorded and reviewed. MSBT diagnosis was achieved either by DBE directed biopsy with multiple tissue sampling, endoscopic findings or histological analysis of surgical specimen. We have analyzed double-balloon enteroscopy impact in outcome and clinical course of these patients.\nOf 627 patients, 28 (4.5%) (mean age = 60 \u00b1 17.3 years) underwent 30 procedures (25 anterograde, 5 retrograde) and were diagnosed of a malignant tumor. Patients presented with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 19, 67.9%), occlusion syndrome (n = 7, 25%) and diarrhea (n = 1, 3.6%). They were diagnosed by DBE biopsy (n = 18, 64.3%), histological analysis of surgical specimen (n = 7, 25%) and unequivocal endoscopic findings (n = 2, 7.1%). Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 8, 28.6%), adenocarcinoma (n = 7, 25%), lymphoma (n = 4, 14.3%), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 4, 14.3%), metastatic (n = 3, 10.7%) and Kaposi sarcoma (n = 1, 3.6%) were identified. DBE modified outcome in 7 cases (25%), delaying or avoiding emergency surgery (n = 3), modifying surgery approach (n = 2) and indicating emergency SB partial resection instead of elective approach (n = 2).\nDBE may be critical in the management of MSBT providing additional information that may be decisive in the clinical course of these patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc90","authors":["Robles, Enrique P\u00e9rez-Cuadrado","Delgado, Pilar Esteban","Conesa, Paloma Bebia","Andr\u00e9s, Blanca Mart\u00ednez","Guggiana, Milivoj Franulic","Mateos, Eduardo Alcaraz","Caballero, Mariana Fern\u00e1ndez","Agudo, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodrigo","Mart\u00ednez, Silvia Chac\u00f3n","Latorre, Rafael","Soria, Federico","Guti\u00e9rrez, Juan Manuel Herrer\u00edas","Mart\u00ednez, Enrique P\u00e9rez-Cuadrado"],"doi":"10.4253\/wjge.v7.i6.652","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T10:58:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1948-5190"],"issue":"6","journal":"World Journal of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1434538699,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26078833?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4253\/wjge.v7.i6.652"],"pmid":"26078833","pubdate":"2015-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Role of double-balloon enteroscopy in malignant small bowel tumors.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-doubleballoon-enteroscopy-malignant-small-bowel-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5207216,"mean":6.1644978826512,"rank":3444290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1547341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5207216,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182893,"mean":8.4713664676422,"rank":119354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":54748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182893,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.4467469879518,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.0346153846154,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BVMurciasalud\/status\/611125717057859584","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4176531],"posted_on":"2015-06-17T10:58:19+00:00","author":{"name":"BVirtual Murciasalud","url":"http:\/\/www.murciasalud.es\/bvms","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489295536244015104\/WBHTnVIf_normal.png","description":"La Biblioteca de la Consejer\u00eda de Sanidad y el SMS para los profesionales sanitarios de la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia.
