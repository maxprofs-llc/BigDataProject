After infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, this homeostasis is often disturbed and CD4+ T cells are instead depleted. Such depletion cannot result simply from accelerated destruction of mature CD4+ T cells - sources of T-cell production must also fail. Ironically, this failure may be precipitated by physiological mechanisms designed to maintain homeostasis in the face of accelerated T-cell loss.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["McCune, J M"],"doi":"10.1038\/35073648","first_seen_on":"2015-06-16T22:09:25+00:00","issns":["0028-0836"],"issue":"6831","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1423998979,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11309627"],"pmid":"11309627","pubdate":"2001-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"The dynamics of CD4+ T-cell depletion in HIV disease.","type":"article","volume":"410","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamics-cd4-tcell-depletion-hiv-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4760465,"mean":5.7118068230344,"rank":1153438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3017655,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4760465,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161903,"mean":8.545426751986,"rank":51131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":107725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161903,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38328,"mean":57.027379340935,"rank":26315,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":6751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38328,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":953,"mean":170.71298529412,"rank":916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":953,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
