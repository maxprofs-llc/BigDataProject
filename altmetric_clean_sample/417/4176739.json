In this paper, a kind of transparent polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel and silicone rubber are developed as suitable substitutions for human soft tissue. Segmentation and 3D reconstruction of medical image are performed to manufacture the mould of organ groups through rapid prototyping technology. Micro-structure observation, force test and CCD deformation test have been conducted to investigate the structure and mechanical properties of PVA hydrogel used in organ group mockup. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image comparison results show that PVA hydrogel consisting of 3g PVA, 17g de-ionized water, 80g dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), 4g NaCl, 1.5g NaOH, 3g epichlorohydrin (ECH) and 7 freeze\/thaw cycles reveals similar micro-structure to human prostate tissue. Through the insertion force comparison between organ group mockup and clinical prostate brachytherapy, PVA hydrogel and silicone rubber are found to have the same mechanical properties as prostate tissue and muscle. CCD deformation test results show that insertion force suffers a sharp decrease and a relaxation of tissue deformation appears when needle punctures the capsule of prostate model. The results exhibit that organ group mockup consisting of PVA hydrogel, silicone rubber, membrane and agarose satisfies the needs of prostate brachytherapy simulation in general and can be used to mimic the soft tissues in pelvic structure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ed5","authors":["Li, Pan","Jiang, Shan","Yu, Yan","Yang, Jun","Yang, Zhiyong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jmbbm.2015.05.012","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T11:52:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-0180"],"journal":"Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials","last_mentioned_on":1434387910,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26042767"],"pmid":"26042767","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Biomaterial characteristics and application of silicone rubber and PVA hydrogels mimicked in organ groups for prostate brachytherapy.","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biomaterial-characteristics-application-silicone-rubber-pva-hydrogels-mimicked-organ-groups-prostate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234318,"mean":6.1678387231822,"rank":4357081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182996,"mean":8.5281509768028,"rank":148413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182996,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218,"mean":2.4101198156682,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.82727272727273,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
