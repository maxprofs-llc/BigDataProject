Descriptive analyses examined the ED and\/or BPH covariate distribution. Logistic regressions calculated odds ratios (ORs, 95% confidence interval) comparing men with ED and\/or BPH, BPH only, or ED only to men with neither condition.\nOf 393 men with BPH, 57.8% had coexistent ED, confirming the moderately strong co-occurrence of the conditions (P\u00a0<.0001). Coexisting ED and\/or BPH occurred in 10.6% of participants, whereas 24.4% and 7.7% reported ED and BPH. After age 60, the odds of reporting ED, BPH, or ED\/BPH vs neither almost tripled per decade of increasing age, corresponding to prevalence increases. The unadjusted odds of ED and\/or BPH vs no disease increased 1.3 times per prostate-specific antigen unit (ng\/mL) increase and 1.1 times per C-reactive protein unit (mg\/dL) increase. Other predisposing factors for ED and\/or BPH included higher body mass index (OR\u00a0= 2.5), increased antidiabetic (OR\u00a0= 2.9) or proton pump inhibitor use (OR\u00a0= 2.3), increased healthcare visits (\u22654; OR\u00a0= 3.5), and more frequent urinary voiding difficulties (OR\u00a0= 9.7).\nCo-occurring ED and\/or BPH is evident in \u223c10% of men\u00a0\u226540\u00a0years old and is associated with significant clinical correlates. Clinicians need to pay greater attention to this clinically important syndrome in aging men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Egan, Kathryn B","Burnett, Arthur L","McVary, Kevin T","Ni, Xiao","Suh, Minhyung","Wong, David G","Rosen, Raymond C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2015.04.054","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T01:15:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0090-4295","1527-9995","00904295"],"issue":"3","journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1465782907,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(15)00561-0\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0090429515005610","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26210004?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429515005610\/pdf","pmid":"26210004","pubdate":"2015-07-27T22:00:28+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"The Co-occurring Syndrome\u2014Coexisting Erectile Dysfunction and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Their Clinical Correlates in Aging Men: Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cooccurring-syndrome-coexisting-ed-bph-clinical-correlates-aging-men-results-national-health-nutriti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7890722,"mean":6.6811441707233,"rank":1170134,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6718059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7890722,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226061,"mean":8.1609024772185,"rank":43065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":182882,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226061,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3161,"mean":4.0782886075949,"rank":291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2867,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3161,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.7831896551724,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":4,"BR":1,"GB":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/status\/610978844741378048","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4173295],"posted_on":"2015-06-17T01:14:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
