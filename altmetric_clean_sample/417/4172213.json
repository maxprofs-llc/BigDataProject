Of particular interest are the N-C bond lengths, which have appreciable double-bond character, and the C-N-C aromatic ring bond angle. Both of these parameters have been studied extensively in 4-amino-substituted quinolines. The crystal structures of (I) and (II) in this study provide interesting examples of the amino-imino tautomerism which exists in this class of compound and is, to the best of our knowledge, hitherto unreported.","authors":["Machado, R.C."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2053229615010311","first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T00:01:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2053-2296"],"issue":"7","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section C Structural Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1434499204,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2053229615010311="],"pmid":"26146394","pubdate":"2015-06-16T00:00:00+00:00","title":"1-(7-Chloro-1,4-di\u00adhydro\u00adquinolin-4-yl\u00adidene)thio\u00adsemicarbazide and its hydro\u00adchloride: evidence for the existence of a stable imine tautomer in the solid state of 4-amino\u00adquinoline free bases, an anomalous case in nitro\u00adgen heterocycles","type":"article","volume":"71","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/17chloro14dihydroquinolin4ylidenethiosemicarbazide-hydrochloride-evidence-existence-stable-imine-tau"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystC\/status\/610960060609597440","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4172213],"posted_on":"2015-06-17T00:00:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Acta Cryst C","url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/c","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877523155862081537\/xcs1csxw_normal.jpg","description":"Acta Crystallographica Section C, published by the IUCr, is a  journal  for rapid dissemination of high-quality crystal and molecular structures","id_on_source":"ActaCrystC","tweeter_id":"587636274","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"},"followers":566},"tweet_id":"610960060609597440"}]}}
