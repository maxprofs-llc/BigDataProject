Previous studies described the presence of various mental disorders associated with Usher syndrome, suggesting possible mechanisms of association between these disorders. The most common manifestations are schizophrenia-like disorder and psychotic symptoms. Mood and behavioral disorders are rarely described, and often are associated with more complex cases in co-occurrence with other psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies reported diffuse involvement of central nervous system (CNS) in Usher patients, suggesting a possible role of CNS damage in the pathogenesis of psychiatric manifestations. Genetic hypothesis and stress-related theories have also been proposed.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef892a83ee09648b553f","authors":["Daniela Domanico","Serena Fragiotta","Alessandro Cutini","Pier Luigi Grenga","Enzo Maria Vingolo"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-17T16:19:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2322-4436"],"issue":"2","journal":"Medical Hypothesis, Discovery & Innovation Ophthalmology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1434398899,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4458326\/"],"pmid":"26060830","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Middle East Persian Teb International Co","startpage":"50","title":"Psychosis, Mood and Behavioral Disorders in Usher Syndrome: Review of the Literature","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychosis-mood-behavioral-disorders-usher-syndrome-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234318,"mean":6.1678387231822,"rank":2592955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2484225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234318,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182996,"mean":8.5281509768028,"rank":92688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":82326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182996,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0555555555556,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrDomanico\/status\/610539351055958020","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4177826],"posted_on":"2015-06-15T20:08:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Daniela Domanico","url":"http:\/\/www.danieladomanico.it","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/546561622072782848\/4sH0R-oq_normal.jpeg","description":"Dirigente Medico OCULISTA I livello Ospedale A.Fiorini Terracina (LT) Servizio Speciale Glaucoma - Riabilitazione Visiva  http:\/\/www.danieladomanico.eu","id_on_source":"DrDomanico","tweeter_id":"189495446","followers":218},"tweet_id":"610539351055958020"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Psychosis, Mood and Behavioral Disorders in Usher Syndrome: Review of the Literature","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=675276832572551&id=345122838921287","license":"public","citation_ids":[4177826],"posted_on":"2015-06-15T20:08:16+00:00","summary":"Altra bella pubblicazione \nben fatta!
