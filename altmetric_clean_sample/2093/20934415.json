Ferroptosis is essentially mediated by iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation upon GPX4 dysfunction. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a master regulator of intracellular free iron due to the conversion of heme to iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin(12), and therefore represents a potential regulator of ferroptotic cell death. In this issue of AJP - Renal Physiology, Adedoyin et al. demonstrate that the lack of HO-1 sensitizes renal tubular cells to ferroptosis(1).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002213","authors":["Andreas Linkermann","Brent R.
