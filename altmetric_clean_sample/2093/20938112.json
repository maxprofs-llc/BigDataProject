Treatments thus far have focused on resuscitation and restoration of macrocirculatory targets in the early phases of sepsis, with less focus on microcirculatory dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine, due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, has been readily investigated in sepsis and has yielded largely incongruous and disappointing results. In addition to its known anti-inflammatory and antioxidative roles, one underappreciated property of NAC is its ability to vasodilate the microcirculation and improve locoregional blood flow. Some investigators have sought to capitalize on this mechanism with promising results, as evidenced by microcirculatory vasodilation, improvements in regional blood flow and oxygen delivery, and reductions in lactic acidosis, organ failure, and mortality.\nIn addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, N-acetylcysteine possesses vasodilatory properties that could benefit the microcirculation in sepsis. It is imperative that we investigate these properties to uncover NAC's full potential for benefit in sepsis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e07","authors":["Jason Chertoff"],"doi":"10.1177\/0885066617696850","first_seen_on":"2017-06-10T02:09:32+00:00","issns":["0885-0666","1525-1489"],"journal":"Journal of Intensive Care Medicine (Blackwell Publishing Limited)","last_mentioned_on":1493276400,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0885066617696850"],"pmid":"28299952","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage CA: Los Angeles, CA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"N-Acetylcysteine\u2019s Role in Sepsis and Potential Benefit in Patients With Microcirculatory Derangements","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ini-acetylcysteines-role-sepsis-potential-benefit-patients-microcirculatory-derangements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8133607,"mean":6.8853774979927,"rank":7043953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8133607,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":218732,"mean":11.701796096575,"rank":176890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":218732,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":373,"mean":4.3345752688172,"rank":310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":373,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":8.88125,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CZ":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"N-Acetylcysteine\u2019s Role in Sepsis and Potential Benefit in Patients With Microcirculatory Derangements - Mar 16, 2017","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1366383023430282&id=221578997910696","license":"public","citation_ids":[20938112],"posted_on":"2017-04-27T07:00:00+00:00","summary":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0885066617696850","author":{"name":"T\u00fcrk Dahili ve Cerrahi Bilimler Yo\u011fun Bak\u0131m Derne\u011fi","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/221578997910696","facebook_wall_name":"T\u00fcrk Dahili ve Cerrahi Bilimler Yo\u011fun Bak\u0131m Derne\u011fi","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/221578997910696\/picture","id_on_source":"221578997910696"}}]}}
