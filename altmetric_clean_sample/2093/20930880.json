Fifty five patients with the diagnosis of scabies were randomized to a single oral dose of ivermectine or placebo. The study informed that 26 (79.3%) patients were cured with ivermectine on their first follow-up visit, as compared to only four (16%) in the placebo group (X2 = 77.07, p < 0.001). Overall, 37 of 50 (74%) patients treated with ivermectine cured, as compared to only four of 26 (16%) treated with placebo, this difference was still significant (X2 = 23.66, p < 0.001). We concluded that ivermectine is a safe and effective treatment for scabies.","altmetric_jid":"56a768e12a83eeb12a8b4951","authors":["Macotela-Ru\u00edz, E","Pe\u00f1a-Gonz\u00e1lez, G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T15:20:00+00:00","issns":["0016-3813"],"issue":"3","journal":"Gaceta m\u00e9dica de M\u00e9xico","last_mentioned_on":1393632000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7926408"],"pmid":"7926408","pubdate":"1993-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[The treatment of scabies with oral ivermectin].","type":"article","volume":"129","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treatment-scabies-oral-ivermectin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7874421,"mean":6.668560753675,"rank":1935386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4853583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7874421,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107813,"mean":10.929257021482,"rank":31842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":75004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107813,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.2492537313433,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
