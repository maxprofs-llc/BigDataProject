Accurate data collection has long been limited by social, cultural, and religious taboos. Understanding knowledge levels and attitudes toward HIV\/AIDS is an important component to design adequate and culturally appropriate awareness and prevention programs.\nA survey was conducted including 3841 participants during a series of public HIV\/AIDS awareness campaigns from 2013 to 2015 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Participants completed a questionnaire including socio-demographic data, and questions around knowledge and attitudes toward HIV\/AIDS. A knowledge score was created. Frequencies were calculated for all variables, mean knowledge scores were compared using non-parametric tests. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared test. The mean knowledge score was 5.2 out of 9 possible points. Respondents in the age class 19-25, respondents with university degrees, and those who know people living with HIV\/AIDS had higher scores. Overall the attitude toward people living with HIV\/AIDS was negative, more than 40% suggested that HIV positive people should be isolated and less than 20% would support a marriage with an HIV positive person. Negative attitudes were more common among people in older age groups, with a lower educational background, and respondents that did not know anyone living with HIV\/AIDS.\nKnowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the general public toward people living with HIV\/AIDS have been identified and can be used to tailor educational campaigns in Saudi Arabia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cd1","authors":["Heba Abdullah Alwafi","Alaa Muhamed Taher Meer","Alaa Shabkah","Fahtima S.
