Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors are thus a potential treatment for AD, but they do not cross the blood-brain barrier. In this short review, we discuss the involvement of TNF-\u03b1 in AD, challenges associated with the development of existing biologic TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors for AD, and potential therapeutic strategies for targeting TNF-\u03b1 for AD therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67c3cf058f6100097e1","authors":["Rachita Sumbria","Rudy Chang","Kei-Lwun Yee","Rachita K Sumbria"],"doi":"10.1177\/1179573517709278","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T23:18:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-5735"],"journal":"Journal of Central Nervous System Disease","last_mentioned_on":1500519869,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28579870","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5436834\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5436834","pmid":"28579870","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 Inhibition for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumor-necrosis-factor-%CE%B1-inhibition-alzheimers-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":10,"3m":10,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":837720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7375436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236640,"mean":11.958412797552,"rank":36792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":199112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236640,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":16.808318181818,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
