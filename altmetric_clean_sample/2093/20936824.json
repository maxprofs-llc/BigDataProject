Donepezil is a licensed drug used in the palliative treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing evidence has reported that donepezil has an anti-inflammatory activity. However, little information is available regarding the role of donepezil in vascular diseases. In this study, we found that pretreatment with donepezil significantly ameliorated endothelial permeability induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) by restoring the expression of the tight junction proteins vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Mechanistically, our results indicate that donepezil regulates the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), but not matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2). Importantly, the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)\/ serine-threonine kinase (AKT)\/ nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway was found to be involved in this process. These results suggest that donepezil may potentially play an important therapeutic role in vascular diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["Xuelu Tang","Xiuhua Di","Yilin Liu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejphar.2017.05.053","first_seen_on":"2017-06-09T23:18:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["00142999"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1497050176,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28576405"],"pmid":"28576405","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Protective effects of Donepezil against endothelial permeability","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":1219090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7048238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242113,"mean":12.571258566283,"rank":50575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":189710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242113,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2540,"mean":2.886536431666,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":2352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2540,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64,"mean":3.392126984127,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"Protective effects of Donepezil against endothelial permeability.","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30853430307&p=1pl&v=1&x=d35A54dEnmnQw1MpoUNg9Q","license":"public","citation_ids":[20936824],"posted_on":"2017-06-09T23:16:16+00:00","summary":".
