The osteoconductive potency of the silk fibroin membranes were evaluated in a defect rabbit calvarial model. Silk fibroin membrane showed the modulated biodegradable and mechanical properties via ethanol treatment with different concentration. The membrane could prevent soft tissue invasion from normal tissue healing, and the amounts of new bone and defect closure with silk fibroin membrane were similar to those of commercially available collagen membrane.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003060","authors":["Yurong Cai","Junmao Guo","Cen Chen","Chenxue Yao","Sung-Min Chung","Juming Yao","In-Seop Lee","Xiangdong Kong"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.msec.2016.08.070","first_seen_on":"2017-04-22T10:47:48+00:00","issns":["09284931"],"issue":"Pt 1","journal":"Materials Science & Engineering: C","last_mentioned_on":1492858054,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27770874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27770874","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Silk fibroin membrane used for guided bone tissue regeneration","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silk-fibroin-membrane-used-guided-bone-tissue-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088698,"mean":6.8825438942685,"rank":7002891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088698,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233078,"mean":12.761085727034,"rank":189770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233078,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":688,"mean":1.7261804949054,"rank":400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":4.31488,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
