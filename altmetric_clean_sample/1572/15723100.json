Aspiration was continued until no more fluid could be obtained. In five patients aspiration was done under ultrasound guidance. No sequelae were observed that could be attributed to aspiration per se. Aspirated fluid was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and giemsa or was passed through 5 micron polycarbonate filters which were then stained in the same way. The aspirated material and polycarbonate filters were also stained with trichrome which proved the best stain to demonstrate the acid-fast hooklets. Such filtration of the total volume of the aspirated material or that evacuated at operation is simple, quick, and accurate.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["P.R. Hira","L.G.
