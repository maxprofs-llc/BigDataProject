Forty-eight patients with clinical stage T1 solid renal masses who underwent a Tc-MIBI SPECT\/CT before partial or radical nephrectomy were evaluated. Conventional CT and MRI, which were approximately performed within 8 weeks before Tc-MIBI, were retrospectively retrieved. Based on a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 5 = definitely malignant), 2 blinded readers recorded their degree of confidence for each lesion using conventional imaging before and after reviewing the Tc-MIBI uptake ratios. Surgical pathology was considered as the reference standard.\nAdditional review of Tc-MIBI SPECT\/CT uptake ratios increased diagnostic confidence in the differentiation of solid renal masses in 14\/48 lesions (29.2%). In 9 lesions, the addition of Tc-MIBI changed the initial confidence levels of malignancy toward benign diagnosis. Postsurgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis of benign histology (oncocytoma\/hybrid oncocytic-chromophobe tumors) in 7 and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (behave as indolent) in 2 of these lesions. Tc-MIBI increased the confidence level toward malignancy in 5 cases; all were confirmed as RCC on surgical pathology. The area under the receiver operative characteristic curve was 0.60 for conventional imaging alone and 0.85 after reviewing Tc-MIBI (P for difference = 0.03).\nPreoperative Tc-MIBI SPECT\/CT enhances the performance of conventional imaging, improving the characterization of benign histologies and lowering the possibility of misclassification.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","authors":["Sara Sheikhbahaei","Christopher S.
