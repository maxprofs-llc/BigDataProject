Serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (S.G.O.T. and S.G.P.T.) were higher, and more often raised, in the hypertensive patients. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were similar in both groups. In hypertensive patients aminotransferase concentrations tended to be higher in those with increased alcohol intake.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6393cf058f610008b2a","authors":["D.G.
