There are remarkable similarities in overall genome composition among the different species at the level of chromosome organisation and chromosome number, conserved order of individual genes, and even conserved functions of specific gene domains and regulatory control elements. With the initiative taken to sequence the genome of P. falciparum, a wealth of information is already becoming available to the scientific community. In order to exploit the biological information content of a complete genome sequence, simple storage of the bulk of sequence data will be inadequate. The requirement for functional analyses to determine the biological role of the open reading frames is commonly accepted and knowledge of the genomes of the animal model malaria species will facilitate these analyses. Detailed comparative genome information and sequencing of additional Plasmodium genomes will provide a deeper insight into the evolutionary history of the species, the biology of the parasite, and its interactions with the mammalian host and mosquito vector. Therefore, an extended and integrated approach will enhance our knowledge of malaria and will ultimately lead to a more rational approach that identifies and evaluates new targets for anti-malarial drug and vaccine development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0f","authors":["Leonard H.M van Lin","Chris J Janse","Andrew P Waters"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0020-7519(99)00196-4","endpage":"370","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T06:54:27+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00207519","0020-7519"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Journal for Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1041379200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0020-7519(99)00196-4"],"pmid":"10731560","pubdate":"2000-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"357","subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"The conserved genome organisation of non-falciparum malaria species: the need to know more","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0020751999001964","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conserved-genome-organisation-nonfalciparum-malaria-species-need-know-more"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7020021,"mean":6.2625478736502,"rank":1646090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4555187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7020021,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86380,"mean":11.069011704234,"rank":25941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":58953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86380,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":3.7456162642948,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
