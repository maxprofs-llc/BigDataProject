An ideal system should have the following attributes: an independent organisation to coordinate patient safety surveillance; agreed frameworks for patient safety and surveillance systems; common, agreed standards and terminology; a single, clinically useful classification for things that go wrong in health care; a national repository for information covering all of health care from all available sources; mechanisms for setting priorities at local, national and international levels; a just system which caters for the rights of patients, society, and healthcare practitioners and facilities; separate processes for accountability and \"systems learnings\"; the right to anonymity and legal privilege for reporters; systems for rapid feedback and evidence of action; mechanisms for involving and informing all stakeholders. There are powerful reasons for establishing national systems, for aligning terminology, tools and classification systems internationally, and for rapid dissemination of successful strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c70","authors":["W B Runciman"],"doi":"10.1136\/qhc.11.3.246","endpage":"251","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T09:23:07+00:00","handle":"2440\/6036","handles":["2440\/6036"],"issns":["14753898","14753901","1475-3898","2044-5423"],"issue":"3","journal":"Quality & Safety in Health Care","last_mentioned_on":1104537600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/qhc.11.3.246","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/qhc.11.3.246"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/qualitysafety.bmj.com\/content\/11\/3\/246.full.pdf","pmid":"12486989","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"246","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"Lessons from the Australian Patient Safety Foundation: setting up a national patient safety surveillance system--is this the right model?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/qualitysafety.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/qhc.11.3.246","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lessons-australian-patient-safety-foundation-setting-up-national-patient-safety-surveillance-systemi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7772166,"mean":6.6362066801147,"rank":1901222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4823758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7772166,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242557,"mean":12.867167441745,"rank":83948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":154399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242557,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":6.8274285714286,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":9,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
