Capillary and agar-gel precipitin technics correctly grouped all 170 strains, with no cross-reaction. One hundred sixty-nine out of the 170 strains were also correctly grouped by the coagglutination technic, and the one strain with a cross-reaction was correctly grouped after blood--agar subculture. Although 20 of the 170 strains showed minor cross-reactions by the coagglutination technic, the specific groups were easily and unquestionably detected, and the minor cross-reactions were easily overcome. A rapid method of grouping by coagglutination technic using 4--6-hour broth culture, done on 75 strains, showed that 73 strains could be correctly grouped by the rapid method and two after overnight incubation. Thus, the coagglutination technic of grouping was found to be easy, reliable, and economical, and could be adopted in any routine diagnostic laboratory as a rapid grouping procedure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f4","authors":["Grace Koshi","Chinnappan Palaniappan Thangavelu","Kootallur Narayanan Brahmadathan"],"doi":"10.1093\/ajcp\/71.6.709","endpage":"712","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T05:09:38+00:00","issns":["0002-9173","1943-7722"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":820454400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ajcp\/71.6.709"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ajcp.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/ajcpath\/71\/6\/709.full.pdf","pmid":"453087","pubdate":"1979-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"709","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"The Reliability and Rapidity of the Coagglutination Technic and Its Comparison with Precipitin Technics in the Grouping of Streptococci","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/ajcp.oxfordjournals.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/ajcp\/71.6.709","volume":"71"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7019110,"mean":6.2626492154463,"rank":1645905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4555181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7019110,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86241,"mean":11.066815236549,"rank":25897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":58862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86241,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1083,"mean":4.0030813308688,"rank":179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1083,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.2928571428571,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Serotyping of streptococcus pneumoniae by agglutination assays : a cost-effective technique for developing countries \/ M.
