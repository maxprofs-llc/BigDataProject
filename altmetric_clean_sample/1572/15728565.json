We discuss the growth of the nanowires using reactive magnetron sputtering as a function of argon and oxygen flow values changing at a set ratio of 10:2. A transition from nanostructured Zn to nanowire ZnO growth is observed at 20 sccm Ar and 4 sccm O2. Densification and improved alignment of the nanowires is visible for increasing flow values up to 50 sccm Ar and 10 sccm O2. Nanowires exhibit stacking fault regions of zinc blende ZnO in wurtzite ZnO. The regions encompass the whole width of the nanowires and their quantum well behavior is manifested in the photoluminescence spectra. The nanowires were subsequently deposited on paper and PET substrates and electromechanical nanogenerators were fabricated. Manual pressing and depressing of the devices induced voltages of 50 \u03bcV and 2 \u03bcV for the devices on PET and paper substrates, respectively.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["M A Borysiewicz","M Gryglas-Borysiewicz","M Mas\u0142yk","T Wojciechowski","M Wzorek","J Kaczmarski","T Wojtowicz","E Kami\u0144ska","M A Borysiewicz","M Gryglas-Borysiewicz","M Mas\u0142yk","T Wojciechowski","M Wzorek","J Kaczmarski","T Wojtowicz","E Kami\u0144ska"],"doi":"10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa56da","first_seen_on":"2017-01-24T09:26:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0957-4484","1361-6528"],"issue":"8","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1485249952,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa56da\/meta;jsessionid=DAAC972717B7DD659E14E653E21412A5.ip-10-40-1-105"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/1361-6528\/aa56da\/pdf","pmid":"28114117","pubdate":"2017-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"085204","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Room temperature sputter deposited catalyst-free nanowires with wurtzite\/zinc blende ZnO superstructure and their application in electromechanical nanogenerators on polymer and paper substrates","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/room-temperature-sputter-deposited-catalystfree-nanowires-wurtzitezinc-blende-zno-superstructure-app"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":4280681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2246797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260776,"mean":12.83365531972,"rank":148509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":86702,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260776,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1584,"mean":6.0347959570436,"rank":821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":545,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1584,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":4.8896307692308,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
