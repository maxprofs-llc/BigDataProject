Here we report on the clinical application of a novel investigational lead to provide analgesia following total knee arthroplasty. In 5 subjects, leads were inserted percutaneously using ultrasound guidance within 0.5 to 3.0 cm of the femoral and\/or sciatic nerve(s). With the delivery of current, pain decreased an average of 63% at rest, with 4 of 5 subjects having relief of >50%. During passive and active knee flexion, pain decreased an average of 14% and 50%, with 0\/3 and 1\/2 subjects attaining >50% relief, respectively. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation may be a practical modality for the treatment of postsurgical pain. This article is protected by copyright.
