Remarkably, a significant similar surgical procedure had already been performed in the late 19th century by Gaston Contremoulins in France and has remained unknown. Contremoulins used the principles of modern stereotaxy in association with radiography for the first time, allowing the successful removal of intracranial bullets in 2 patients. This surgical premiere, greatly acknowledged in the popular French newspaper L'Illustration in 1897, received little scientific or governmental interest at the time, as it emanated from a young self-taught scientist without official medical education. This surgical innovation was only made possible financially by popular crowdfunding and, despite widespread military use during World War I, with 37,780 patients having benefited from this technique for intra- or extracranial foreign bodies, it never attracted academic or neurosurgical consideration. The authors of this paper describe the historical context of stereotactic developments and the personal history of Contremoulins, who worked in the department of experimental physiology of the French Academy of Sciences led by \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey in Paris, and later devoted himself to radiography and radioprotection. The authors also give precise information about his original stereotactic tool \"the bullet finder\" (\"le chercheur de projectiles\") and its key concepts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d98","authors":["Pierre Bourdillon","Caroline Apra","Marc L\u00e9v\u00eaque"],"doi":"10.3171\/2016.11.jns161417","first_seen_on":"2017-05-12T19:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0022-3085","1933-0693"],"journal":"Journal of Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1495382086,"links":["http:\/\/thejns.org\/doi\/abs\/10.3171\/2016.11.JNS161417","http:\/\/thejns.org\/doi\/full\/10.3171\/2016.11.JNS161417"],"pmid":"28498054","pubdate":"2017-05-13T22:03:31+00:00","publisher":"American Association of Neurological Surgeons","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"First clinical use of stereotaxy in humans: the key role of x-ray localization discovered by Gaston Contremoulins","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.95,"score_history":{"1y":5.95,"6m":5.95,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8247986,"mean":6.9694821610306,"rank":1440082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6803989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8247986,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243178,"mean":12.277214317143,"rank":56437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":186505,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243178,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2600,"mean":6.7260923432089,"rank":488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2600,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":21.225614457831,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"NL":1,"DE":1,"TR":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TheJNS\/statuses\/863109053723144192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20082224],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T19:10:08+00:00","author":{"name":"J Neurosurgery","url":"http:\/\/www.thejns.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/830607735293112320\/84miKR8n_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Neurosurgery (JNS), the world's leading journal in #neurosurgery, and the official journal of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons","id_on_source":"TheJNS","tweeter_id":"64708973","geo":{"lt":38.02931,"ln":-78.47668,"country":"US"},"followers":8440},"tweet_id":"863109053723144192"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnA25_03\/statuses\/863109743254130688","license":"gnip","rt":["TheJNS"],"citation_ids":[20082224],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T19:12:53+00:00","author":{"name":"anna bruynzeel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671228882779897856\/Q0D23azE_normal.jpg","description":"Radiation Oncologist VU MD, PhD University Medical Center","id_on_source":"AnnA25_03","tweeter_id":"3133597841","geo":{"lt":52.58333,"ln":4.91667,"country":"NL"},"followers":381},"tweet_id":"863109743254130688"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ElderMachadoLe2\/statuses\/863110450837430280","license":"gnip","rt":["TheJNS"],"citation_ids":[20082224],"posted_on":"2017-05-12T19:15:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Elder Machado  Leite","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/830533016158081024\/yz2GWI_g_normal.jpg","description":"Professor em Neuropsiquiatria e Ci\u00eancias do Comportamento.
