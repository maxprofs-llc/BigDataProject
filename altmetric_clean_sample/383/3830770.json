{"altmetric_id":3830770,"citation":{"abstract":"Ratings for the West Delta Water Conservation and Irrigation Rehabilitation Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were not applicable; risk to development outcome was not applicable; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. The specific development objectives of the project were to achieve financial sustainability of irrigation infrastructure in the West Delta and to promote greater efficiency in the use of water resources established through a public-private partnership and farmer's participation. The project was approved by the Board on June 21 2007, but the loan agreement was not signed by the Government until September 1, 2008 and the project was declared effective on July 8, 2009. The loan became effective only in October 2009. The implementation schedule devised at appraisal (four years duration) turned out to be highly unrealistic. Prequalification of bidders: based on the Bank prequalification guidelines, a lengthy prequalification process was completed by the end of 2007. As a result of this process, five consortia were prequalified. International (French, Spanish, Italian and Chinese) and national contractors were amongst those prequalified. Despite the fact that two pre-bid conferences took place in March and May 2008, the first bidding exercise of August 2008 was not successful as none of the prequalified consortia submitted a bid. This was principally due to: (i) the payment risks were considered too high; (ii) the guarantees by the Government were not sufficient for the private sector in the demand risk was not sufficiently advanced to be satisfactory to the private sector. This was linked to the fact that Public Private Partnership (PPP) in construction and operation of large scale irrigation projects is uncommon worldwide, and the willingness of the private sector to assume the expected risks was limited. After the project was approved by the Government and declared effective in July 2009, the consortia expressed their continued interest in the project but indicated that they still considered that the payment \/ demand risk was too great. The risk was perceived as both political (political decisions might interfere with the companies' ability to collect water charges from the farmers), as well as a real credit risk (that farmers might default on their promised to pay the irrigation tariff due to unforeseen developments in the sector).","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T13:06:15+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1414539011,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2012\/05\/20328238\/egypt-west-delta-water-conservation-irrigation-rehabilitation-project","http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2012\/05\/20328238\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2014\/10\/28\/000333037_20141028051308\/Rendered\/PDF\/NCO22210P0879700disclosed0100240140.pdf","pubdate":"2012-05-15T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"Egypt - West Delta Water Conservation and Irrigation Rehabilitation Project","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/20328238"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":3},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":3,"unique_users":["noworldbank","Bewickwren","searshjob"],"posts_count":3}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/noworldbank\/status\/527131992328896513","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830770],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T16:17:15+00:00","author":{"name":"noworldbank","url":"http:\/\/www.noworldbank.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1405956351\/wbxredlogofin_copy_normal.png","description":"#Occupy and Say NO to the #WorldBank http:\/\/www.noworldbank.com #OpESR #OccupyWB #OccupyIMF #Anonymous #Activism #HumanRights #Grassroots","id_on_source":"noworldbank","tweeter_id":"294131075","geo":{"lt":"31.9524685","ln":"-102.1732905","country":"US"},"followers":891},"tweet_id":"527131992328896513"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bewickwren\/status\/527240946291712000","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830770],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T23:30:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Common Raven","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1277624031\/Landscape_2009_Snow_Sept_IMG_4227_normal.jpg","description":"Wx spotter; CoCoRaHS; community emergency awareness; Firewise; gardener; bird watcher; foster rescue dogs; photo editor; weight lifter; owned by Spaniels.","id_on_source":"Bewickwren","tweeter_id":"144703320","geo":{"lt":34.50034,"ln":-106.00085,"country":"US"},"followers":7840},"tweet_id":"527240946291712000"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/searshjob\/status\/527057324112740352","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830770],"posted_on":"2014-10-28T11:20:32+00:00","author":{"name":"brun bandy","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000852316228\/5729e63bb221cf5fb044d2c77e4a3bb8_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"searshjob","tweeter_id":"2238310657","followers":14},"tweet_id":"527057324112740352"}]}}
