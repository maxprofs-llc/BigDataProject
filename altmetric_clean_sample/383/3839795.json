Aging is associated with chronic diseases and an increasing number of concomitant diseases. This poses a major care challenge care, with more fragile patients and new needs. This also requires a sustainable approach: the concurrence of several chronic diseases affects the cost of care, which is especially acute in times of severe economic crisis. One of the pillars of the strategy for dealing with chronic diseases in our region is care integration, in an effort to adapt the organization to the new needs. The Balanced Scorecard or Integrated Scorecard of the integration process was introduced as it has been designed. The integration of primary and hospital care at an organizational level has already been completed, and the development of integrated care processes has also been performed in order to achieve real integration at care level. To help finance this, a prospective capitation system is gradually being implemented, achieving a convergence of per capita costs in the different health areas integrated. Nurses has a key role in this process, their skills as educators and trainers in self-care, in the role of case managers of patients with particularly complex conditions, and the role of professional liaison to improve the transition between care areas and units.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058c0","doi":"10.1016\/j.enfcli.2013.12.005","first_seen_on":"2015-03-26T08:18:12+00:00","issns":["11308621"],"journal":"Enfermeria clinica.","last_mentioned_on":1427357870,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1130862113001940"],"pmid":"24468496","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"title":"Integraci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica en el paciente cr\u00f3nico ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integraci%C3%B3n-cl%C3%ADnica-en-el-paciente-cr%C3%B3nico-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925544,"mean":5.8485273635848,"rank":2613758,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1646787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925544,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145893,"mean":10.354666287391,"rank":84092,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145893,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":2.1841866666667,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.3625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":3,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/C_Sarabia_Cobo\/status\/581007137955913728","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3839795],"posted_on":"2015-03-26T08:17:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Carmen Sarabia Cobo","url":"https:\/\/goo.gl\/FMl02j","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/827486613093613568\/Lm-XjsUh_normal.jpg","description":"PhD.
