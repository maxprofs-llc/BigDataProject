Infection occurs via inoculation, ingestion or inhalation of the causative organism (Burkholderia pseuodmallei) present in soil and water. Here, we evaluated public awareness of melioidosis using a combination of population-based questionnaire, a public engagement campaign to obtain video clips made by the public, and viewpoints on these video clips as potential educational tools about the disease and its prevention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Praveen Chansrichavala","Nittayasee Wongsuwan","Suthee Suddee","Mayura Malasit","Maliwan Hongsuwan","Prapass Wannapinij","Rungreung Kitphati","Nicholas P J Day","Susan Michie","Sharon J Peacock","Direk Limmathurotsakul","Chansrichavala P","Wongsuwan N","Suddee S","Malasit M","Hongsuwan M","Wannapinij P","Kitphati R","Day NP","Michie S","Peacock SJ","Limmathurotsakul D","Nicholas P.
