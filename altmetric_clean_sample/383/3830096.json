{"altmetric_id":3830096,"citation":{"abstract":"India is uniquely placed to help reduce global poverty and boost shared prosperity. As India continues to transform from a largely rural, agrarian economy into an increasingly urbanized one, more emphasis will be needed on creating strong linkages between the urban and rural parts of the country. The World Bank Group will support efforts to help India and its people reap the benefits of urbanization, while also improving agricultural productivity. The strategy seeks to help India lay the foundation for achieving a long-term vision for 2030, a vision of the nation as a global economic powerhouse where more and more people share the benefits of growth and where no more than 5.5 percent of the population lives in poverty and 41.3 percent of the population is no longer vulnerable to falling back. To help achieve the vision for India in 2030 and contribute to its ongoing transformation, the WBG strategy focuses on three broad areas of engagement: integration, rural-urban transformation and inclusion. Improving domestic, as well as regional and global, integration is key to high, sustained growth, and accelerated poverty reduction. As India continues to transform from a largely rural, agrarian economy into an increasingly urbanized one, more emphasis will be needed on creating strong linkages between the urban and rural parts of the country. WBG will support efforts to help India and its people reap the benefits of urbanization while also improving agricultural productivity. A third area of support is to work in partnership to help foster the inclusion of all social and economic groups, regardless of age, gender, caste, or place of residence, thus ensuring that the benefits of faster economic growth touch the lives of all of India\u0092s people. All three areas of engagement will share a focus on improving governance, promoting environmental sustainability, and bolstering gender equality.","authors":["The World Bank"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T12:45:25+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1387493496,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2013\/10\/18487518\/india-world-bank-group-time-transformation-country-partnership-strategy-2013-2017-summary"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2013\/11\/07\/000456286_20131107161916\/Rendered\/PDF\/826040WP0CPS0E00Box379865B00PUBLIC0.pdf","pubdate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"India and the World Bank Group in a time of transformation : the country partnership strategy 2013-2017 - a summary","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/18487518"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IN":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":2},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":2,"unique_users":["fzodin","Sadaf05953555"],"posts_count":2}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fzodin\/status\/413803834662998016","license":"datasift","rt":["Sadaf05953555"],"citation_ids":[3830096],"posted_on":"2013-12-19T22:51:36+00:00","author":{"name":"SultanFzOdin","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000747565332\/c3a415b857bcf6af86663ea2d3cf956a_normal.jpeg","description":"Student of  M.A ECONOMICS II LOVES= MOVIES+MUSIC+TRAVELING...... coming soon ...","id_on_source":"fzodin","tweeter_id":"471813449","geo":{"lt":"22.3511148","ln":"78.6677428","country":"IN"},"followers":48},"tweet_id":"413803834662998016"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sadaf05953555\/status\/413411579208540161","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830096],"posted_on":"2013-12-18T20:52:55+00:00","author":{"name":"Sadaf Fatima Hussain","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000777448749\/f54ed18c5e04dad2251fae9d6f5992a3_normal.jpeg","description":"choclates world bank handbag fetish","id_on_source":"Sadaf05953555","tweeter_id":"2193975648","followers":3},"tweet_id":"413411579208540161"}]}}
