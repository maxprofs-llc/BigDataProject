{"altmetric_id":3830967,"citation":{"abstract":"This note describes a framework for linking fiscal policy and growth issues in low-income countries. The framework has been developed in the context of a recently, completed Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) report in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region.  The note describes first the framework and then illustrates its application to fiscal reform and growth prospects in the context of Haiti. The note concludes by laying out an agenda for developing this framework further, ideally to facilitate use of this framework in preparing more Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) and elaborating medium-term budget frameworks.","altmetric_jid":"repec","authors":["Moreira, Emmanuel Pinto"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T13:11:22+00:00","handle":"10986\/11125","handles":["10986\/11125"],"issns":[],"journal":"Research Papers in Economics (RePEc)","last_mentioned_on":1375469380,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2009\/03\/10536727\/linking-fiscal-policy-growth-reports-operational-framework-low-income-countries","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10986\/11125"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2009\/05\/08\/000333037_20090508004544\/Rendered\/PDF\/483740BRI0prem10Box338903B01PUBLIC1.pdf","pubdate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","repec":"RePEc:wbk:wboper:11125","startpage":"1","title":"Linking fiscal policy and growth  in PER reports: : an operational framework for low-income countries","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/10536727"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3685046,"mean":4.9228975163162,"rank":2947135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3685046,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79467,"mean":9.0788103339794,"rank":65859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":254,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79467,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6937,"mean":6.0802488465975,"rank":5958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6937,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":13.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":1},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["maldiveanalyst"],"posts_count":1}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/maldiveanalyst\/statuses\/363371033815810048","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830967],"posted_on":"2013-08-02T18:49:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Maldive Analyst","url":"http:\/\/www.maldiveanalyst.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2529107220\/ma_normal.jpeg","description":"Maldives based, English language online magazine, offering analysis about current affairs, politics, business, technology and culture.","id_on_source":"maldiveanalyst","tweeter_id":"772290619","followers":13},"tweet_id":"363371033815810048"}]}}
