In small samples of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, it was shown that methane breath excretion correlates with clinical presentation and delayed gastrointestinal transit time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between intestinal production and breath excretion of CH4 and to correlate CH4 production with the presence and the severity of symptoms, in a large cohort of IBS patients and in a group of healthy volunteers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021fa","authors":["Michele Di Stefano","Caterina Mengoli","Manuela Bergonzi","Catherine Klersy","Elisabetta Pagani","Emanuela Miceli","Gino Roberto Corazza"],"doi":"10.1038\/ajg.2015.47","first_seen_on":"2015-03-25T18:18:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1572-0241"],"journal":"American Journal of Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1441307606,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25803403"],"pmid":"25803403","pubdate":"2015-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Breath Methane Excretion Is not An Accurate Marker of Colonic Methane Production in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/breath-methane-excretion-not-accurate-marker-colonic-methane-production-irritable-bowel-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5980767,"mean":6.045523634593,"rank":2765993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3050319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5980767,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158753,"mean":10.311150410704,"rank":83238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":68921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158753,"percentile":43},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1726,"mean":7.2904034782609,"rank":1106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":575,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1726,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":14.579045454545,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
