We introduce a cross-polarization (CP) OCT image metric called Integral Depolarization Factor (IDF) to enable automatic diagnosis of bladder conditions (assessment the functional state of collagen fibers). IDF-based diagnostic accuracy of identification of the severe fibrosis of normal bladder mucosa is 79%; recurrence of carcinoma on the post-operative scar is 97%; and differentiation between neoplasia and acute inflammation is 75%. The promising potential of CP OCT combined with image analysis in human urology is thus demonstrated in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c7b","authors":["Elena Kiseleva"],"doi":"10.1364\/boe.6.001464","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T22:44:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2156-7085"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biomedical Optics Express","last_mentioned_on":1427240723,"links":["http:\/\/www.opticsinfobase.org\/boe\/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-6-4-1464"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.opticsinfobase.org\/viewmedia.cfm?uri=boe-6-4-1464&seq=0","pmid":"25909028","pubdate":"2015-04-25T22:01:00+00:00","publisher":"Optical Society of America","title":"Differential diagnosis of human bladder mucosa pathologies in vivo with cross-polarization optical coherence tomography","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-diagnosis-human-bladder-mucosa-pathologies-vivo-crosspolarization-optical-coherence-tom"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6427587,"mean":5.8881981586857,"rank":3005661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3396047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6427587,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160750,"mean":10.282017953456,"rank":90884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":69036,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160750,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":8.3422909836066,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":1.5837358490566,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
