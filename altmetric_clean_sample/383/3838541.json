Merci!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Primary flexor tendon repair is still challenging even in the most experienced hands. With atraumatic surgery, the goal is to suture the tendon in a way that it will be strong enough to allow for tendon gliding without the risk of rupture or adhesions during the 12 weeks needed for the tendon to heal. After reviewing the zone 2 anatomy, the authors describe the state of art for flexor tendon repair along with their personal preferences. Although suture methods and postoperative rehabilitation programs are not universal, most specialized teams now use multistrand suturing techniques with at least 4 stands along with protected and controlled early active mobilization. Although the published rates of failure of the repair or postoperative adhesions with stiffness have decreased, these complications are still a concern. They will continue to pose a challenge for scientists performing research into the mechanics and biology of flexor tendon repairs, especially in zone 2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002521","doi":"10.1016\/j.main.2014.07.010","first_seen_on":"2015-03-25T23:19:38+00:00","issns":["12973203"],"journal":"Chirurgie de la Main","last_mentioned_on":1427356861,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S129732031400136X?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&ccp=y&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"25442406","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"R\u00e9paration primitive des tendons fl\u00e9chisseurs en zone 2 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/r%C3%A9paration-primitive-des-tendons-fl%C3%A9chisseurs-en-zone-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4925544,"mean":5.8485273635848,"rank":2442359,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2334237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4925544,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145739,"mean":10.341781086608,"rank":76688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":62610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145739,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.1625,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
