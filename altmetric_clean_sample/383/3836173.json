We previously found that SUMO-1 marks chromatin at the proximal promoter regions of some of the most active housekeeping genes during interphase in human cells, but the SUMOylated targets on the chromatin remained unclear. In this study, we found that SUMO-1 marks the promoters of ribosomal protein genes via modification of the Scaffold Associated Factor B (SAFB) protein, and the SUMOylated SAFB stimulated both the binding of RNA polymerase to promoters and pre-mRNA splicing. Depletion of SAFB decreased RNA polymerase II binding to promoters and nuclear processing of the mRNA, though mRNA stability was not affected. This study reveals an unexpected role of SUMO-1 and SAFB in the stimulatory coupling of promoter binding, transcription initiation and RNA processing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Hui-Wen Liu","Tapahsama Banerjee","Xiaoyan Guan","Michael A Freitas","Jeffrey D Parvin"],"doi":"10.1093\/nar\/gkv246","first_seen_on":"2015-03-25T12:53:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4962"],"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","last_mentioned_on":1427291286,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25800734?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25800734","pubdate":"2015-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The chromatin scaffold protein SAFB1 localizes SUMO-1 to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes to facilitate transcription initiation and splicing.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chromatin-scaffold-protein-safb1-localizes-sumo1-promoters-ribosomal-protein-genes-facilitate-transc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4921283,"mean":5.846301915641,"rank":2440760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2332210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4921283,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145633,"mean":10.344222341244,"rank":76643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":62549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145633,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8796,"mean":3.7422737919272,"rank":5742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":2767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8796,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250,"mean":4.6151485943775,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
