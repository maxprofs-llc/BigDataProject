Gas phase treatment of MoS2 with oxygen radicals generated in an upstream N2 -O2 plasma is shown to enhance the photoluminescence (PL) of many-layer, mechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes by up to 20 times, without reducing the layer thickness of the material. A blueshift in the PL spectra and narrowing of linewidth are consistent with a transition of MoS2 from indirect to direct bandgap material. Atomic force microscopy and Raman spectra reveal that the flake thickness actually increases as a result of the plasma treatment, indicating an increase in the interlayer separation in MoS2 . Ab initio calculations reveal that the increased interlayer separation is sufficient to decouple the electronic states in individual layers, leading to a transition from an indirect to direct gap semiconductor. With optimized plasma treatment parameters, we observed enhanced PL signals for 32 out of 35 many-layer MoS2 flakes (2-15 layers) tested, indicating that this method is robust and scalable. Monolayer MoS2 , while direct bandgap, has a small optical density, which limits its potential use in practical devices. The results presented here provide a material with the direct bandgap of monolayer MoS2 , without reducing sample thickness, and hence optical density.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006895","authors":["Dhall, Rohan","Neupane, Mahesh R.","Wickramaratne, Darshana","Mecklenburg, Matthew","Li, Zhen","Moore, Cameron","Lake, Roger K.","Cronin, Stephen"],"doi":"10.1002\/adma.201405259","first_seen_on":"2015-03-25T13:11:13+00:00","issns":["1521-4095"],"journal":"Advanced Materials","last_mentioned_on":1426723200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adma.201405259"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adma.201405259\/pdf","pmid":"25589365","pubdate":"2015-01-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry","biophysics"],"title":"Direct Bandgap Transition in Many\u2010Layer MoS2 by Plasma\u2010Induced Layer Decoupling","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/direct-bandgap-transition-manylayer-mos2-plasmainduced-layer-decoupling"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4888304,"mean":5.8155820430968,"rank":320777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4563324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4888304,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144899,"mean":10.273594832227,"rank":16819,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":127929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144899,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3366,"mean":8.6033117384844,"rank":392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":2959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3366,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":18.793487804878,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
