The reactions are carried out in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) and take advantage of the ability of this solvent to continuously release small amounts of HCl by thermolytic elimination. A study of the reaction led to several improved protocols such as (1) preheated TCE, (2) microwave-assisted reactions, and (3) flow or sealed-tube conditions, which allow significant reaction rate enhancements and made possible some challenging reactions such as the \u03b1-amidoalkylation of ketones. Studies using flow chemistry confirmed not only that very low concentrations of HCl generated from the solvent were responsible for the reactivity but also that TCE had additional beneficial properties in comparison to other chlorinated solvents such as dichloroethane. The method can easily be extended to the alkylation using proelectrophiles such as \u03c0-activated alcohols, which are normally unreactive toward HCl catalysis. This work represents the first successful use of HCl, the simplest strong Br\u00f8nsted acid, as an efficient alkylation catalyst.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["M\u00e9lanie Hamon"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo4015886","first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T23:21:33+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1398870221,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo4015886"],"pmid":"24533649","pubdate":"2014-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Intra- and intermolecular alkylation of N,O-acetals and pi-activated alcohols catalyzed by in situ generated acid.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intra-intermolecular-alkylation-n-oacetals-%CF%80activated-alcohols-catalyzed-situ-generated-acid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3708907,"mean":4.9739512648776,"rank":2967671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71322,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3708907,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93001,"mean":9.1849550967743,"rank":77632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93001,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2810,"mean":3.0042798148807,"rank":2033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2810,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":0.77313580246914,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
