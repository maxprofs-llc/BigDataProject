{"altmetric_id":3830355,"citation":{"abstract":"Indonesia is the world largest archipelagic country consisting of more than 17,000 islands spread over more than 5,000 kilometers from west to east. The land area is 1,860,360 km\u00b2 and the sea area 5,800,000 km\u00b2 with a total of 81,000 km of coastal line. The population is more than 237 million (2010). The population density is 124 inhabitants per km\u00b2. The population is very uneven distributed over the islands. Java has 58 percent of the population with only 7 percent of the total area. The population density in Java is 1,055 inhabitants per km\u00b2. Maluku and Papua and Kalimantan have much lesser population densities with 11 and 25 inhabitants per km\u00b2, respectively. The geographical nature of Indonesia with its many islands and the uneven distribution of the population put enormous challenges in developing infrastructure and tackling regional disparities. Lack of infrastructure has hampered the effort to develop and realize the national and regional economic potentials. The organization of an efficient logistics system is a crucial factor in the socio-economic development of Indonesia. The objective of the state of logistics Indonesia 2013 is to provide a status update of logistics performance in Indonesia. In addition, specific information is provided on logistics cases.","authors":["Bahagia, Ir.
