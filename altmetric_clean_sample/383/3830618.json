{"altmetric_id":3830618,"citation":{"abstract":"The 14 indicators describe a country's macro-fiscal environment to identify constraints or opportunities for health systems financing. For each indicator two aspects are important: level and trend. A country with a 10 percent unemployment rate that has fallen from 15 percent may be in better shape than one with an 8 percent unemployment rate that has risen from 4 percent. It is also important to benchmark to group averages of countries in the same Word Bank (WB) region (EAS, ECS, LCN, MEA, NAC, SAS, or SSF) and income group (HIC, upper MIC, lower MIC, or LIC).","authors":["Smitz, Marc","Eozenou, Patrick","Pande, Aaka","Leive, Adam","Ozcelik, Ece","Cortez, Rafael"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-24T13:00:00+00:00","issns":[],"last_mentioned_on":1377089434,"links":["http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/2013\/01\/18128535\/united-states-america-macro-fiscal-context-health-financing-factsheet"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www-wds.worldbank.org\/external\/default\/WDSContentServer\/WDSP\/IB\/2013\/08\/21\/000333037_20130821154511\/Rendered\/PDF\/804560BRI0Micr0Box0379804B00PUBLIC0.pdf","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1","title":"United States of America - Macro-fiscal context and health financing factsheet","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/documents.worldbank.org\/curated\/en\/18128535"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"counts":{"total":{"posts_count":1},"twitter":{"unique_users_count":1,"unique_users":["jonathan70us"],"posts_count":1}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jonathan70us\/statuses\/370166032855756800","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3830618],"posted_on":"2013-08-21T12:50:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Jonathan Knighton","url":"http:\/\/www.zerosides.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/511513867772375040\/UtkV9VrP_normal.jpeg","description":"Private investor, reality tester.
