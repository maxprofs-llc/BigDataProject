{"altmetric_id":3830990,"citation":{"abstract":"The theme of the World Development Report (WDR) 2007 is youth, aged 12 to 24.  It focuses on decisions concerning the five phases with the biggest long-term impact on how human capital is kept safe, developed, and deployed.  For each phase (continuing to learn, starting to work, developing a healthful lifestyle, beginning a family, and exercising citizenship) governments must increase investments directly and cultivate an environment for young people and their families to invest in themselves.  The WDR suggests that a youth lens on policies affecting the five phases would help focus on three broad directions: expanding opportunities, enhancing capabilities, and providing second chances.  Each pathway (opportunities, capabilities, and second chances) is applied to each of the transitions, generating reform suggestions.To mobilize the economic and political resources to stimulate such reforms, countries must resolve three issues: better coordination and integration with national policy, stronger voice, and more evaluation. In addition, the WDR examines both youth migration, and their increasing use of new technologies.","authors":["Murthi, Mamta","Ridao-Cano, Cristobal","Jimenez, Emmanuel Y.","Lundberg, Mattias K.
