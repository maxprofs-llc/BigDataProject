This review discusses the definition, assessment, and management of frailty and sarcopenia, and examines the relationship between them. Medline, Scopus and Psychoinfo databases were searched using the keywords frailty, sarcopenia, aging, and functional disability. The findings are that frailty and sarcopenia are often assessed clinically with such methods such as DeXA, CT scan, MRI, bioelectrical impedance, or anthropometry. Frailty and sarcopenia differentially affect older adults. Both conditions are characterized by decreased energy reserves and resistance to external and internal stressors, resulting in susceptibility to fatigue, comorbidity, sedentary life style, functional decline, hospitalization, quality of life, and even death. The estimated prevalence of frailty with sarcopenia is relatively low; however, the condition requires early detection and careful management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd24","authors":["Eli Carmeli"],"book":[],"doi":"10.1007\/5584_2017_18","first_seen_on":"2017-08-14T13:23:49+00:00","issns":["0065-2598"],"journal":"Advances in experimental medicine and biology","last_mentioned_on":1501323626,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28382607\/?i=6&from=carmeli%20e"],"pmid":"28382607","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Frailty and Primary Sarcopenia: A Review","type":"chapter","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frailty-primary-sarcopenia-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":4411369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2307993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138964,"mean":11.079872642358,"rank":75141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":50130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138964,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2417,"mean":3.515767384106,"rank":1089,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2417,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/118394456149082288391\/posts\/Rra5XVGQxVh","license":"public","citation_ids":[23788906],"posted_on":"2017-07-29T10:20:26+00:00","summary":"Frailty and Primary Sarcopenia: A Review. - PubMed - NCBI Adv Exp Med Biol. 2017 Apr 6. doi: 10.1007\/5584_2017_18.
