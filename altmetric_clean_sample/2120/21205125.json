This study extends the knowledge of exercise quota systems by examining their effects on beliefs relevant to exercise avoidance. Results indicate that exercise quota systems produce systematic increases in both exercise levels and expectancies of capability while reducing worry and concern about exercising. These data highlight the importance of avoidance learning in chronic pain and suggest that the effectiveness of exercise quota systems is related to a deconditioning process based on exposure rather than the process of applying reinforcement to quota achievement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003281","authors":["Dolce, J J","Crocker, M F","Moletteire, C","Doleys, D M"],"first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T18:52:46+00:00","issns":["0304-3959"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pain (03043959)","last_mentioned_on":1497934177,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3960576"],"pmid":"3960576","pubdate":"1986-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Exercise quotas, anticipatory concern and self-efficacy expectancies in chronic pain: a preliminary report.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exercise-quotas-anticipatory-concern-selfefficacy-expectancies-chronic-pain-preliminary-report"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":7258147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236858,"mean":12.923961073559,"rank":193720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236858,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3303,"mean":9.6898346456693,"rank":3123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3303,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":14.060625,"rank":57,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
