Participants were asked about symptoms and discomfort due to radiotherapy, management methods for radiation dermatitis, unmet needs for radiation dermatitis care, and clinical and socio-demographic information.\nOf total, 108 out of 111 patients (97.3%) reported symptoms related to radiation dermatitis. Hyperpigmentation was the most commonly reported uncomfortable symptom followed by erythema. On average, patients reported 8.6 radiotherapy-induced skin problems (range, 0-11). Of total, 59 (53.2%) patients stated that they wanted care for radiation dermatitis, and 80.0, 59.4, and 51% of patients searched for information, used products, and visited the hospital to manage radiotherapy-related skin problems. Patients who experienced dryness, burning feelings, irritation, roughness, and hyperpigmentation were 11.73, 7.02, 5.10, 4.27, and 2.80 times more likely to have management needs than patients without those symptoms, respectively, adjusting age, current cycle of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and type of surgery.\nMost of the breast cancer patients experience multiple symptoms associated with radiation dermatitis. Hyperpigmentation was the most common and uncomfortable symptom followed by erythema. Majority of patients wanted management for radiation dermatitis and patients who experienced dryness, burning feelings, irritation, roughness, and hyperpigmentation had higher needs for radiation dermatitis management.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000340e","authors":["Jieun Lee","Won Park","Doo Ho Choi","Seung Jae Huh","Im-Ryung Kim","Danbee Kang","Juhee Cho"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11136-017-1526-4","first_seen_on":"2017-06-20T19:38:48+00:00","issns":["0962-9343","1573-2649"],"journal":"Quality of Life Research","last_mentioned_on":1497987517,"links":["https:\/\/rd.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs11136-017-1526-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11136-017-1526-4.pdf","pmid":"28238091","pubdate":"2017-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Quality of Life Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sociology, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Patient-reported symptoms of radiation dermatitis during breast cancer radiotherapy: a pilot study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patientreported-symptoms-radiation-dermatitis-during-breast-cancer-radiotherapy-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":6372391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1138834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236858,"mean":12.923743853886,"rank":168104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":43099,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236858,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1336,"mean":3.5481887640449,"rank":909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1336,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":2.3912753623188,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
