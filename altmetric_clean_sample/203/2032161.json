Therefore, several interventions are suggested in literature to improve adherence rates in clinical practice. Adherence to treatment can be particularly troublesome in adolescents, who strive for autonomy and self-care independence. Literature suggests that improving adherence is useful to guarantee positive outcomes and reduce costs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f610009803","authors":["A Bagnasco","P Petralia","S Furnari","S Ghio","S Calza","L Sasso"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-09T18:14:33+00:00","issns":["1121-2233"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Preventive Medicine & Hygiene","last_mentioned_on":1389291248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24396995?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24396995","pubdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Paediatric nurses' perception of the child-family dyad's autonomy in managing a chronic disease situation: the experience of an Italian paediatric department.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paediatric-nurses-perception-childfamily-dyads-autonomy-managing-chronic-disease-situation-experienc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3562862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123091,"mean":7.6136693963769,"rank":95505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123091,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.2864666666667,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.3,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
