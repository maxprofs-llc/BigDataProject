Clinical trials with \u03b2-blockers suggest that HR reduction is an important mechanism of their benefit in pts with stable CHF. Pharmacologic inhibition of the I(f) current now provides the opportunity of pure HR reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of ''Off-Label'' use of ivabradine on exercise capacity, gas exchange, functional class, quality of life, and neurohormonal modulation in pts with ischemic CHF.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bba","authors":["Filippo M.
