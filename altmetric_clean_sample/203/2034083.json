Here, we report our discovery of tumor-specific inactivation of the MYC-associated factor X gene, MAX, in SCLC. MAX inactivation is mutually exclusive with alterations of MYC and BRG1, the latter coding for an ATPase of the switch\/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI\/SNF) complex. We demonstrate that BRG1 regulates the expression of MAX through direct recruitment to the MAX promoter, and that depletion of BRG1 strongly hinders cell growth, specifically in MAX-deficient cells, heralding a synthetic lethal interaction. Furthermore, MAX requires BRG1 to activate neuroendocrine transcriptional programs and to upregulate MYC targets, such as glycolysis-related genes. Finally, inactivation of the MAX dimerization protein, MGA, was also observed in both non-small cell lung cancer and SCLC. Our results provide evidence that an aberrant SWI\/SNF-MYC network is essential for lung cancer development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcb","authors":["Octavio A Romero","Manuel Torres-Diz","Eva Pros","Suvi Savola","Antonio Gomez","Sebastian Moran","Carmen Saez","Reika Iwakawa","Alberto Villanueva","Luis M Montuenga","Takashi Kohno","Jun Yokota","Montse Sanchez-Cespedes"],"doi":"10.1158\/2159-8290.cd-13-0799","first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T08:29:04+00:00","issns":["2159-8290","2159-8274"],"journal":"Cancer Discovery","last_mentioned_on":1413907508,"links":["http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/20\/2159-8290.CD-13-0799.abstract?sid=6a7d90df-ad0e-42d7-b2eb-3de31e4f2c56","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1158\/2159-8290.CD-13-0799","http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/20\/2159-8290.CD-13-0799.abstract","http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2014\/02\/13\/2159-8290.CD-13-0799.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24362264?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/4\/3\/292.full?keytype=ref&siteid=aacrjnls&ijkey=FkfTX5QOPSCho","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24362264"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org\/content\/early\/2013\/12\/20\/2159-8290.CD-13-0799.full.pdf","pmid":"24362264","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MAX inactivation in small-cell lung cancer disrupts the MYC-SWI\/SNF programs and is synthetic lethal with BRG1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/max-inactivation-small-cell-lung-cancer-disrupts-mycswisnf-programs-synthetic-lethal-brg1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":33.9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":33.9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":251364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":7808028,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185925,"mean":7.2509920290013,"rank":6831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":179088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185925,"percentile":96},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1476,"mean":7.8880515254237,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":1392,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1476,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":9.0773170731707,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":11},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
