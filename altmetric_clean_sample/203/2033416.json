A \u03b3-thiol-Glu building block was accessed in only three steps from protected glutamic acid and could be incorporated at the N-terminus of peptides. The application of these peptides in one-pot ligation-desulfurization chemistry is demonstrated with a range of peptide thioesters, and the utility of this methodology is highlighted through the synthesis of the osteoporosis peptide drug teriparatide (Forteo).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Katie M.
