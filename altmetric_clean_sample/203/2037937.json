An initial cluster analysis revealed two patterns of Internet use-low and high frequency-among these men. Although frequency of Internet use to find partners for venue encounters did not cluster with venue attendance, there was a trend among high-frequency Internet users to attend gyms, public bathrooms, and sex clubs more than low-frequency users. Furthermore, high-frequency users attended more venues, preferred venues where multiple partners can be found, and were marginally more likely to engage in unprotected anal sex across venues compared with low-frequency users. Knowing that some venue users initiate venue encounters on the Internet may be useful in targeting appropriate HIV\/STI interventions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006981","authors":["Martin J.
