The implementation of imaging to study the spleen is rapidly advancing our knowledge of this so-called \"blackbox\" of the abdominal cavity. Not only has ex vivo imaging revealed the complex functional compartmentalization of the organ and immune effector cells, but it has also allowed the observation of major structural remodeling during infections. In vivo imaging, on the other hand, has allowed quantitative measurements of the dynamic passage of the parasite at spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we review imaging techniques used for studying the malarious spleen, from optical microscopy to in vivo imaging, and discuss the bright perspectives of evolving technologies in our present understanding of the role of this organ in infections caused by Plasmodium.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003293","doi":"10.1016\/j.parint.2013.08.014","first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T09:05:42+00:00","issns":["13835769"],"journal":"Parasitology International","last_mentioned_on":1389344736,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1383576913001293"],"pmid":"23999413","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Authors","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Imaging of the spleen in malaria","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/imaging-spleen-malaria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2744618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":726065,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111333,"mean":7.1338280458451,"rank":81780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":24351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111333,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":1.6067669902913,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.74130434782609,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
