No quantitative evaluation has been reported to support this hypothesis. Emago\u00ae software (Oral Diagnostic Systems, Amsterdam, Netherlands) can perform digital subtraction on intraoral radiographs even if they were obtained by non-standardized radiography, provided the dimensional error is within a certain limit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether sclerotic changes of alveolar bone or thickening of lamina dura in patients using BP can be detected using the subtraction function of Emago.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f35","authors":["M U Zaman","T Nakamoto","K Tanimoto"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T16:11:03+00:00","issns":["0250-832X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Dentomaxillofacial Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1389370248,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24404602?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24404602","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","dentistry"],"title":"A retrospective study of digital subtraction technique to detect sclerotic changes in alveolar bone on intraoral radiographs of bisphosphonate-treated patients.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-study-digital-subtraction-technique-detect-sclerotic-changes-alveolar-bone-intraoral-r"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063727,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122885,"mean":7.6420111487259,"rank":80529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":27336,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122885,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":1.0352380952381,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.41666666666667,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Ph.D. Student":3,"Student (Postgraduate)":1,"Student (Master)":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine":4,"Computer and Information Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dentalradiology\/status\/421675500876988419","license":"public","citation_ids":[2035170],"posted_on":"2014-01-10T16:10:48+00:00","author":{"name":"Dental Radiology","url":"http:\/\/www.radiologiavaldivia.cl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/968927661\/7800506_normal.jpg","description":"Information for dentists & radiology specialist by @sergiouribe, DDS, Maxillofacial Radiologist.","id_on_source":"dentalradiology","tweeter_id":"153141448","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":356},"tweet_id":"421675500876988419"}]}}
