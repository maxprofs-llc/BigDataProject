Afterward, the scaffolds were evaluated by structural, microscopic, physical, and mechanical assays and cell culture analyses. Results of structural, physical, and mechanical analyses also showed a good resilience and compliance with movement as a skin graft. Cellular experiments showed a better cell adhesion, growth, and proliferation inside the modified scaffolds compared with unmodified ones. In animal models with histological examinations, all groups, excluding the control group especially the groups treated with stem cells, exhibited the most pronounced effect on wound closure, with the statistically significant improvement in wound healing being seen at postoperative day 21. These data suggest that chitosan-modified PHBV scaffold loaded with CB-derived USSCs could significantly contribute to wound repair and be potentially used in the tissue engineering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b3a","authors":["Zeinali, Reza","Biazar, Esmaeil","Keshel, Saeed Heidari","Tavirani, Mostafa Rezaei","Asadipour, Kamal"],"doi":"10.1097\/mat.0000000000000025","endpage":"114","first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T14:55:49+00:00","issns":["1058-2916"],"issue":"1","journal":"ASAIO Journal: A Peer-Reviewed Journal of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs","last_mentioned_on":1476303733,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=2014&issue=01000&article=00019&type=abstract&elq=6b3b8496fb204e7ea4294631d763fc34&elqCampaignId=12","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/Fulltext\/2014\/01000\/Regeneration_of_Full_Thickness_Skin_Defects_Using.19.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/2014\/01000\/Regeneration_of_Full_Thickness_Skin_Defects_Using.19.pdf","pmid":"24346243","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Engineering","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"106","title":"Regeneration of Full-Thickness Skin Defects Using Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cells Loaded into Modified Porous Scaffolds","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/asaiojournal\/Fulltext\/2014\/01000\/Regeneration_of_Full_Thickness_Skin_Defects_Using.19.aspx","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regeneration-fullthickness-skin-defects-using-umbilical-cord-blood-stem-cells-loaded-modified-porous-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7529066,"mean":6.5069445313556,"rank":5434748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1829459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7529066,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181954,"mean":7.1005944172399,"rank":107769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181954,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":1.7950361445783,"rank":267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.0125,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
