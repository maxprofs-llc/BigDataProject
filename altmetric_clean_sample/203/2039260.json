Test-and-slaughter strategies, the basis of most bTB eradication programs carried out worldwide, have demonstrated its usefulness in the control of the disease. However, in certain countries, eradication has not been achieved due in part to limitations of currently available diagnostic tests. In this study, results of in-vivo and post-mortem diagnostic tests performed on 3,614 animals from 152 bTB-infected cattle herds (beef, dairy, and bullfighting) detected in 2007-2010 in the region of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain, were analyzed to identify factors associated with positive bacteriological results in cattle that were non-reactors to the single intradermal tuberculin test, to the interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) assay, or to both tests applied in parallel (Test negative\/Culture + animals, T-\/C+). The association of individual factors (age, productive type, and number of herd-tests performed since the disclosure of the outbreak) with the bacteriology outcome (positive\/negative) was analyzed using a mixed multivariate logistic regression model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","doi":"10.1186\/1746-6148-10-14","first_seen_on":"2014-01-13T09:50:21+00:00","issns":["1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1389613230,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/10\/14\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1746-6148\/10\/14\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-6148-10-14.pdf","pmid":"24410926","pubdate":"2014-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"14","title":"Risk factors associated with negative in-vivo diagnostic results in bovine tuberculosis-infected cattle in Spain","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-associated-negative-invivo-diagnostic-results-bovine-tuberculosisinfected-cattle-spain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7407556,"mean":6.4397165474936,"rank":5344262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1803502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7407556,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183324,"mean":7.1213304168055,"rank":108352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183324,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1098,"mean":2.4289735642662,"rank":599,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1098,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":3.0071836734694,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
