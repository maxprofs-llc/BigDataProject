Thirty-two parents from 28 families of children with ASD in mainland China were interviewed. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four patterns of parenting styles which varied in affiliation to the roles of caretaker and coach. Based on their experience, a sizable group of parents perceived that their own emotions influence the child's emotions and his\/her symptoms. The results suggest the value of developing intervention programs on emotion regulation and positive parenting for the parents of children with ASD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028ad","authors":["Ting Zhou","Chunli Yi","Zhou, Ting","Yi, Chunli"],"doi":"10.1111\/famp.12058","endpage":"79","first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T13:24:13+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1545-5300","0014-7370"],"issue":"1","journal":"Family Process","last_mentioned_on":1416056226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24400727?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12058\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24400727?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/famp.12058\/pdf","pmid":"24400727","pubdate":"2014-01-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"67","subjects":["socialsciences","primaryhealthcare","psychology"],"title":"Parenting Styles and Parents' Perspectives on How Their Own Emotions Affect the Functioning of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parenting-styles-parents-perspectives-own-emotions-affect-functioning-children-autism-spectrum-disor-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6306418,"mean":5.9759110537734,"rank":818408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5486843,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6306418,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150857,"mean":7.6957598504536,"rank":23648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":127140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150857,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233,"mean":3.5017586206897,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.0875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
