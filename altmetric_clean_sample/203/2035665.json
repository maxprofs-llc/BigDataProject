Reductive intercalation of ALaNb2O7 with alkali metal (A = K, Rb) and RbCa2Nb3O10 with Rb leads to A2LaNb2O7 and Rb2Ca2Nb3O10, respectively. Oxidative intercalation with stoichiometric amounts of water vapor, produced by the decomposition of calcium oxalate monohydrate in a sealed ampule, allows the insertion hydroxide species. Compounds of the form (A2OH)LaNb2O7 (A = K, Rb) and (Rb2OH)Ca2Nb3O10 are accessible. X-ray diffraction data indicates a clear layer expansion of almost 3 \u00c5 on the insertion of hydroxide relative to that of the parent. Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data collected on deuterated samples of (Rb2OD)LaNb2O7 (P4\/mmm space group, a = 3.9348(1) \u00c5, c = 14.7950(7) \u00c5) finds that both rubidium and oxygen species reside in cubic sites forming a CsCl-like interlayer structure between niobate perovskite blocks. Hydrogens, attached to the interlayer oxygens, are disordered over a 4-fold site in the x-y plane and have O-H bond distances (0.98 \u00c5) consistent with known hydroxide species. This synthetic approach expands the library of available topochemical reactions, providing a facile method for the construction of alkali-metal hydroxide layers within receptive perovskite hosts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Dariush Montasserasadi","Debasish Mohanty","Ashfia Huq","Luke Heroux","Edward Andrew Payzant","John B.
