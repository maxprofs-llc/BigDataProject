European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 21, 522-560, 2009), several studies have suggested that the motor system used to interact with objects in our environment is involved in object recognition (e.g., Helbig, Graf, & Kiefer Experimental Brain Research, 174, 221-228, 2006). However, the role of the motor system in immediate memory for objects is more controversial. The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of the motor system in object memory by manipulating the similarity between the actions associated to series of objects to be retained in memory. In Experiment 1, we showed that lists of objects associated to dissimilar actions were better recalled than lists associated to similar actions. We then showed that this effect was abolished when participants were required to perform a concurrent motor suppression task (Experiment 2) and when the objects to be memorized were unmanipulable (Experiment 3). The motor similarity effect provides evidence for the role of motor affordances in object memory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e7","authors":["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Downing-Doucet","Katherine Gu\u00e9rard"],"doi":"10.3758\/s13423-013-0570-5","first_seen_on":"2014-01-09T18:41:53+00:00","issns":["1531-5320","1069-9384"],"journal":"Psychonomic Bulletin & Review","last_mentioned_on":1407267891,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.3758%2Fs13423-013-0570-5","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.3758\/s13423-013-0570-5"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.3758%2Fs13423-013-0570-5.pdf","pmid":"24395096","pubdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"A motor similarity effect in object memory","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/motor-similarity-effect-object-memory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4792463,"mean":5.7357771951068,"rank":2544204,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1596309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4792463,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":129345,"mean":7.8482996814697,"rank":63398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":48243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":129345,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":648,"mean":7.9196506955178,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":136,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":648,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":7.2534166666667,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
