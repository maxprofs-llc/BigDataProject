To correlate biochemically quantifiable defects resulting from point mutations in Pol-\u03b3 with their physiological consequences, we created \"humanized\" yeast, replacing the yeast mtDNA polymerase (MIP1) with human Pol-\u03b3. Despite differences in the replication and repair mechanism, we show that the human polymerase efficiently complements the yeast mip1 knockouts, suggesting common fundamental mechanisms of replication and conserved interactions between the human polymerase and other components of the replisome. We also examined the effects of four disease-related point mutations (S305R, H932Y, Y951N, and Y955C) and an exonuclease-deficient mutant (D198A\/E200A). In haploid cells, each mutant results in rapid mtDNA depletion, increased mutation frequency, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mutation frequencies measured in vivo equal those measured with purified enzyme in vitro. In heterozygous diploid cells, wild-type Pol-\u03b3 suppresses mutation-associated growth defects, but continuous growth eventually leads to aerobic respiration defects, reduced mtDNA content, and depolarized mitochondrial membranes. The severity of the Pol-\u03b3 mutant phenotype in heterozygous diploid humanized yeast correlates with the approximate age of disease onset and the severity of symptoms observed in humans.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Yufeng Qian","Aashiq H Kachroo","Christopher M Yellman","Edward M Marcotte","Kenneth A Johnson"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m113.526418","first_seen_on":"2014-01-10T23:17:54+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1393974885,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24398692?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/289\/9\/5970.abstract.html"],"pmid":"24398692","pubdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Yeast cells expressing the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase reveal correlations between polymerase fidelity and human disease progression.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/yeast-cells-expressing-human-mitochondrial-dna-polymerase-reveal-correlations-between-polymerase-fid-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":1879715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2570842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122869,"mean":7.6179193606148,"rank":44475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":76347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122869,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30237,"mean":2.4900870485514,"rank":17965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":12190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30237,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":5.4890921985816,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DNA_PHD\/status\/440988746607898624","license":"public","rt":["MyBioTechniques"],"citation_ids":[2035911],"posted_on":"2014-03-04T23:14:45+00:00","author":{"name":"John Bush","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/478641437261578240\/WOgIy_Ni_normal.png","description":"BIOLOGIST","id_on_source":"DNA_PHD","tweeter_id":"34327907","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":104},"tweet_id":"440988746607898624"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mholden0\/status\/421782864665911296","license":"public","citation_ids":[2035911],"posted_on":"2014-01-10T23:17:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Matthew T.
