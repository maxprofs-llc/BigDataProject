Fundus torsion was evaluated by measuring the disk foveal angle (DFA) using fundus photography. The axis of astigmatism was identified from the anterior sagittal map using Pentacam corneal imaging.\nA total of 54 eyes of 27 patients were included. Patients were divided into two groups: those with esotropia and those with exotropia. All patients had a preoperative DFA >8\u00b0, which decreased postoperatively in both groups (P < 0.01). Postoperatively, there was incyclorotation of the axis of astigmatism by >5\u00b0 in 80% of the esotropic group and 75% of the exotropic groups (P < 0.01).\nIncyclorotation of the axis of astigmatism occurs after IO myectomy. Measurement of the change in the axis of astigmatism can be used to assess the torsional changes after IO myectomy in patients with IOOA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b5b","authors":["Awadein, Ahmed","El-Fayoumi, Dina","Zedan, Rasha H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jaapos.2016.03.008","endpage":"294","first_seen_on":"2016-10-15T08:36:17+00:00","issns":["1528-3933","10918531"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of AAPOS (Journal of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus)","last_mentioned_on":1477983272,"links":["http:\/\/www.jaapos.org\/article\/S1091-8531(16)30052-0\/fulltext?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1091853116300520&_version=1&md5=719427d463a9a89d038c70151e4fe947"],"pmid":"27138808","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"289","subjects":["pediatrics","ophthalmology"],"title":"Changes in the axis of astigmatism and in fundus torsion following inferior oblique muscle weakening","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/changes-axis-astigmatism-fundus-torsion-following-inferior-oblique-muscle-weakening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.45,"score_history":{"1y":2.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":3040360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":4580408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241732,"mean":12.39016739268,"rank":92256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":149079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241732,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":2.6176468253968,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.4975609756098,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JO":1,"CA":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyef52\/statuses\/787210403222851584","license":"gnip","rt":["OphthaTweets"],"citation_ids":[12631399],"posted_on":"2016-10-15T08:36:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Fakhri El Hammouri","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1994801697\/SAM_1512_normal.JPG","id_on_source":"eyef52","tweeter_id":"311440241","geo":{"lt":31,"ln":36,"country":"JO"},"followers":1027},"tweet_id":"787210403222851584"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DonSmallman\/statuses\/785678119671779329","license":"public","rt":["OphthaTweets"],"citation_ids":[12631399],"posted_on":"2016-10-11T03:07:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Don Smallman","url":"http:\/\/www.kingstoneyeinstitute.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/850252812160073729\/NZ-Bl7ym_normal.jpg","description":"Ophthalmologist, Asst.
