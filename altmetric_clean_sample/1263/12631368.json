In the emerging era of immunotherapy, therapeutic cancer vaccines are an attractive option to cure, control and prevent cancer. Despite this, finding a feasible and efficacious vaccine platform has proven elusive across all malignancies. Vesigenurtacel-L is the first whole cell, allogeneic vaccine intended to treat high-grade, nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. This type of vaccine technology for bladder cancer is novel, and has the potential to be both economically and logistically feasible.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008df2","authors":["Aryeh Keehn"],"doi":"10.2217\/fon-2016-0284","first_seen_on":"2016-10-15T08:35:02+00:00","issns":["1744-8301","1479-6694"],"journal":"Future Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1476520489,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/fon-2016-0284?journalCode=fon&"],"pmid":"27609194","pubdate":"2016-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in the management of high-grade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vesigenurtacell-hs410-management-highgrade-nonmuscle-invasive-bladder-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7546003,"mean":6.5175573163071,"rank":3897310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2111696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7546003,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239288,"mean":12.410643428184,"rank":130875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239288,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":4.0360263929619,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":305,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":21.610784313725,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ugaotrader\/statuses\/787210106928857088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12631368],"posted_on":"2016-10-15T08:34:49+00:00","author":{"name":"ugaotrader","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/778658417795801088\/1w7YD3OB_normal.jpg","description":"Professional Independent #StockTrader.
