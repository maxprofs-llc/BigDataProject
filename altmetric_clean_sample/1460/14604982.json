ACT aimed to actively engage participants for 12 months with assertive, regular, minimum weekly contact. ACT was combined with TAU. TAU comprised access to the full range of services provided by the community teams. Primary outcome is mean drinks per drinking day and percent days abstinent at 12 months follow up. Analysis of covariance was conducted using 80% confidence intervals, appropriate in the context of a pilot trial.\nA total of 94 participants were randomized, 45 in ACT and 49 in TAU. Follow-up was achieved with 98 and 88%, respectively at 12 months. Those in ACT had better treatment engagement, and were more often seen in their homes or local community than TAU participants. At 12 months the ACT group had more problems related to drinking and lower quality of life than TAU but no differences in drinking measures. The ACT group had a higher percentage of days abstinent but lower quality of life at 6 months. The ACT group had less unplanned healthcare use than TAU.\nAn trial of ACT was feasible to implement in an alcohol dependent treatment population.\nISRCTN22775534.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021c6","authors":["Colin Drummond","Helen Gilburt","Tom Burns","Alex Copello","Michael Crawford","Ed Day","Paolo Deluca","Christine Godfrey","Steve Parrott","Abigail Rose","Julia Sinclair","Simon Coulton","Drummond, Colin","Gilburt, Helen","Burns, Tom","Copello, Alex","Crawford, Michael","Day, Ed","Deluca, Paolo","Godfrey, Christine","Parrott, Steve","Rose, Abigail","Sinclair, Julia","Coulton, Simon"],"doi":"10.1093\/alcalc\/agw091","first_seen_on":"2016-12-09T09:36:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc","dohuk"],"issns":["1464-3502","0735-0414"],"journal":"Alcohol & Alcoholism","last_mentioned_on":1502792922,"links":["http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/08\/alcalc.agw091","https:\/\/kar.kent.ac.uk\/59564\/","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/08\/alcalc.agw091?rss=1&utm_content=buffer632cb&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/08\/alcalc.agw091.abstract?papetoc","https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/alcalc\/article\/52\/2\/234\/2660942\/Assertive-Community-Treatment-For-People-With?searchresult=1","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27940571","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27940571\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27940571?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/alcalc\/early\/2016\/12\/08\/alcalc.agw091.full.pdf","pmid":"27940571","pubdate":"2016-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/alcalc.oxfordjournals.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1093\/alcalc\/agw091","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assertive-community-treatment-people-alcohol-dependence-pilot-randomized-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.95,"score_history":{"1y":13.95,"6m":10.2,"3m":6.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":626707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7752609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279629,"mean":12.031664304003,"rank":32612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":246953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279629,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1124,"mean":6.846464826358,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1124,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":6.4219130434783,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":15,"researcher":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":15,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":12,"US":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrG_NHS\/statuses\/896998164363870208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14604982],"posted_on":"2017-08-14T07:33:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Geraldine Strathdee","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000452013359\/6b94440fd0912aeaf5e59fcc33af9a04_normal.jpeg","description":"National Clinical Director, mental health , 2013-2016: Consultant Psychiatrist @OxleasNHS, Visiting Prof. @UCLPartners.
