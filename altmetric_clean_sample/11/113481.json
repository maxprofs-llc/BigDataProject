Under a variety of conditions and tests, there is a consistent and reproducible distinction between \"northern\" and \"southern\" European population groups: most individual participants with southern European ancestry (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek) have >85% membership in the \"southern\" population; and most northern, western, eastern, and central Europeans have >90% in the \"northern\" population group. Ashkenazi Jewish as well as Sephardic Jewish origin also showed >85% membership in the \"southern\" population, consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups. Based on this work, we have developed a core set of informative SNP markers that can control for this partition in European population structure in a variety of clinical and genetic studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Michael F Seldin","Russell Shigeta","Pablo Villoslada","Carlo Selmi","Jaakko Tuomilehto","Gabriel Silva","John W Belmont","Lars Klareskog","Peter K Gregersen","Michael F.
