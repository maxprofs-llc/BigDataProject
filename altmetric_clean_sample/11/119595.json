Previous research demonstrated the efficacy of expert system interventions for three behaviors in a population of parents. The interventions provide individualized feedback that guides participants through the stages of change for each of their risk behaviors. This study extended that research to a more representative population of patients from primary care practice and to targeting of four rather than three behaviors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003383","authors":["James O.
