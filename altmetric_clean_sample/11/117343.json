Some have been introduced in special journal issues or websites with a search function, but others remain scattered throughout the Internet and in the published literature. The searchable resources on these sites are collected and maintained manually and are therefore of higher quality than automatically updated sites, but also require more time and effort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Yasunori Yamamoto","Toshihisa Takagi","Yamamoto, Yasunori","Takagi, Toshihisa"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-8-287","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2105","14712105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1188751560,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/8\/287\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/8\/287"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-8-287.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1976328","pmid":"17683589","pubdate":"2007-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"287","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"OReFiL: an online resource finder for life sciences","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orefil-online-resource-finder-life-sciences"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.368,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.368},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8005094,"mean":6.7552691735077,"rank":590343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7414782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8005094,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7369245,"mean":7.0762568681359,"rank":573553,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6795669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7369245,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3531,"mean":4.9700730878187,"rank":287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3531,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3437,"mean":5.0223591385332,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3437,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
