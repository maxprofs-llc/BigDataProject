We used two sets of novel stimuli to examine the functional consequences of this dark dominance in human observers. We show that increment and decrement thresholds are equal when controlled for adaptation and eye movements. However, measurements for salience differences at high contrasts show that darks are detected pronouncedly faster and more accurately than lights when presented against uniform binary noise. In addition, the salience advantage for darks is abolished when the background distribution is adjusted to control for the irradiation illusion. The threshold equality suggests that the highest sensitivities of neurons in the ON and OFF channels are similar, whereas the salience difference is consistent with a population advantage for the OFF system.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Stanley Jose Komban","Jose-Manuel Alonso","Qasim Zaidi"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.0504-11.2011","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"23","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1308067595,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/31\/23\/8654.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/31\/23\/8654.full.pdf","pmid":"21653869","pubdate":"2011-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"8654","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Darks Are Processed Faster Than Lights","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/darks-processed-faster-lights"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505992,"mean":5.1115236646191,"rank":2328672,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1533708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505992,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441620,"mean":5.7488615151398,"rank":1806937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1138107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441620,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10242,"mean":6.5695307098916,"rank":5712,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2596,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10242,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9597,"mean":6.8137077949146,"rank":5222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":2471,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9597,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
