"],"citation":{"abstract":"An excitonic interaction caused by the H-aggregation of fluorescent dyes is a new type of useful photophysical process for fluorescence-controlled nucleic acid sensing. This critical review points out the recent advances in exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotide (ECHO) probes, which have a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide in which two molecules of thiazole orange or its derivatives are linked covalently. ECHO probes show absorption shift and emission switching depending on hybridization with the target nucleic acid. The hybridization-sensitive fluorescence emission of ECHO probes and the further modification of probes have made possible a variety of practical applications, such as multicolor RNA imaging in living cells and facile detection of gene polymorphism (144 references).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ee","authors":["Akimitsu Okamoto"],"doi":"10.1039\/c1cs15025a","issns":["1460-4744","0306-0012"],"issue":"12","journal":"Chemical Society Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1398844762,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2011\/CS\/C1CS15025A?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:%20rss\/CS%20(RSC%20-%20Chem.%20Soc.%20Rev.%20latest%20articles)","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/c1cs15025a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/cs\/c1cs15025a","pmid":"21660343","pubdate":"2011-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"5815","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"ECHO        probes: a concept of fluorescence control for practical nucleic acid sensing","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/echo-probes-concept-fluorescence-control-practical-nucleic-acid-sensing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506051,"mean":5.113311188876,"rank":844897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3633381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506051,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3441624,"mean":5.749006222651,"rank":719413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":2697145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3441624,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1006,"mean":2.5063184079602,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1006,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":770,"mean":2.7498153446034,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":770,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
