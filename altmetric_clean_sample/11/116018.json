The output is a resource description framework (RDF) site summary (RSS) feed, which potentially carries many advantages over conventional announcement mechanisms, including the ability to aggregate and then sort multiple and diverse RSS feeds on the basis of declared metadata and to feed into RDF-based mechanisms for establishing links between different subject areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5723cf058f610004c74","authors":["Henry S.
