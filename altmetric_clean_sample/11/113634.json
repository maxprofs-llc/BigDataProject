The recent draft MAC genome assembly revealed low sequence repetitiveness, a result of the epigenetic removal of invasive DNA elements found only in the MIC genome. Such low repetitiveness makes complete closure of the MAC genome a feasible goal, which to achieve would require standard closure methods as well as removal of minor MIC contamination of the MAC genome assembly. Highly accurate preliminary annotation of Tetrahymena's coding potential was hindered by the lack of both comparative genomic sequence information from close relatives and significant amounts of cDNA evidence, thus limiting the value of the genomic information and also leaving unanswered certain questions, such as the frequency of alternative splicing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Coyne RS","Thiagarajan M","Jones KM","Wortman JR","Tallon LJ","Haas BJ","Cassidy-Hanley DM","Wiley EA","Smith JJ","Collins K","Lee SR","Couvillion MT","Liu Y","Garg J","Pearlman RE","Hamilton EP","Orias E","Eisen JA","Meth\u00e9 BA"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-9-562","issns":["1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1227718199,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/562"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2164-9-562.pdf","pmid":"19036158","pubdate":"2008-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"562","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Refined annotation and assembly of the Tetrahymena thermophila genome sequence through EST analysis, comparative genomic hybridization, and targeted gap closure","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bmc-genomics-1343"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635015,"mean":4.9193540767705,"rank":327529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3280711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635015,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2730856,"mean":5.2093590761903,"rank":268653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2440261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2730856,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3347,"mean":3.2928714883443,"rank":254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":3083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3347,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3160,"mean":3.2538524849636,"rank":246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":2904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3160,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Tackling a Hairy Beast II","url":"http:\/\/phylogenomics.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/tackling-hairy-beast-ii.html","citation_ids":[113634],"posted_on":"2008-11-26T16:49:59+00:00","summary":"For all out there who love ciliates and their relatives, you might want to check out the second paper to come out of my Tetrahymena thermophila Genome Sequencing Project for which the preprint is available in BMC Genomics.
