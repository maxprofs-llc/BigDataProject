Harnessing the photoswitching properties of spiropyran fluorophores, we achieved nanoresolution fluorescence imaging using photoactuated unimolecular logical switching attained reconstruction (PULSAR) microscopy. The PULSAR microscope successfully resolved nanostructures and subcellular organelles when the photoswitchable nanoparticles containing spiropyran dyes were used as fluorescent probes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Dehong Hu","Zhiyuan Tian","Wuwei Wu","Wei Wan","Alexander D.
