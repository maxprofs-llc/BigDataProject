In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c43","authors":["Robert Maccabee Centor","Jeroan Julius Allison","Stuart James Cohen"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11606-006-0020-4","endpage":"130","issns":["0884-8734","1525-1497"],"issue":"1","journal":"JGIM: Journal of General Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1375007357,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/k8n5431261l41261\/fulltext.html"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11606-006-0020-4.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1824719","pmid":"17351852","pubdate":"2007-01-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"127","subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Pharyngitis Management: Defining the Controversy","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharyngitis-management-defining-controversy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.932,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.932},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6535297,"mean":6.0631729513083,"rank":467723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6070696,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6535297,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5606280,"mean":6.6415415715132,"rank":445531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":5160745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5606280,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2605,"mean":9.9413425499232,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2605,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2571,"mean":10.040927626459,"rank":417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2571,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
