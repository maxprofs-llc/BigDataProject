This compound performs stable vesicle aggregation in water and shows aggregation-dependent emission in its open form. The fluorescence can be effectively switched by alternating between UV and visible light irradiation. This compound thus can stain KB cells for switchable living cell imaging with excellent resistance to fatigue.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Ying Zou","Tao Yi","Shuzhang Xiao","Fuyou Li","Chunyan Li","Xia Gao","Junchen Wu","Mengxiao Yu","Chunhui Huang"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja8043163","endpage":"15751","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0002-7863","1520-5126"],"issue":"47","journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1225840966,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/ja8043163"],"pmid":"18973291","pubdate":"2008-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"15750","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Amphiphilic Diarylethene as a Photoswitchable Probe for Imaging Living Cells","type":"article","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/amphiphilic-diarylethene-photoswitchable-probe-imaging-living-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.312,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.312},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":553317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3078291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728918,"mean":5.213222266566,"rank":453882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2274590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728918,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12993,"mean":4.0845846674877,"rank":2703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":10282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12993,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12902,"mean":4.025243159445,"rank":2666,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":10228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12902,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
