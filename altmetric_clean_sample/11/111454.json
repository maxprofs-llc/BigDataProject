The hybrid lens achieves focal length tunability by changing its shape and, at the same time, utilizes the unique dispersion property of diffractive surfaces to enhance its spectral performance within a wide tuning range.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2009OptL...34.2793Z","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5773cf058f610004d26","authors":["Guangya Zhou","Hui Min Leung","Hongbin Yu","A.
