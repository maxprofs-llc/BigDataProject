Using maximally localized Wannier functions to treat the macroscopic polarization we formulate a first-principles, parameter-free, generalization of Kirkwood's phenomenological theory. Our calculated static permittivity is in good agreement with experiment. Two effects of the hydrogen bonds, i.e., a significant increase of the average local moment and a local alignment of the molecular dipoles, contribute in almost equal measure to the unusually large dielectric constant of water.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Manu Sharma","Raffaele Resta","Roberto Car"],"issns":["0031-9007"],"issue":"24","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1306533840,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17677991"],"pmid":"17677991","pubdate":"2007-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Dipolar correlations and the dielectric permittivity of water.","type":"article","volume":"98","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dipolar-correlations-dielectric-permittivity-water"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":328274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3271971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2727537,"mean":5.2196709902311,"rank":269245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":2433818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2727537,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11976,"mean":6.7980417536534,"rank":2068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":9624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11976,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9343,"mean":7.0029192892314,"rank":1676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":7394,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9343,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":37,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
