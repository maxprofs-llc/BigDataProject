The strange sensation that somebody is nearby when no one is actually present has been described by psychiatric and neurological patients, as well as by healthy subjects, but it is not understood how the illusion is triggered by the brain. Here we describe the repeated induction of this sensation in a patient who was undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, as a result of focal electrical stimulation of the left temporoparietal junction: the illusory person closely 'shadowed' changes in the patient's body position and posture. These perceptions may have been due to a disturbance in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporoparietal junction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2006Natur.443..287A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Shahar Arzy","Margitta Seeck","Stephanie Ortigue","Laurent Spinelli","Olaf Blanke"],"doi":"10.1038\/443287a","endpage":"287","issns":["1476-4687","0028-0836"],"issue":"7109","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1504877760,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v443\/n7109\/abs\/443287a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16988702","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16988702\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/443287a","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v443\/n7109\/full\/443287a.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v443\/n7109\/full\/443287a.html?foxtrotcallback=true","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v443\/n7109\/full\/443287a.html"],"pmid":"16988702","pubdate":"2006-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"287","subjects":["science"],"title":"Induction of an illusory shadow person","type":"article","volume":"443","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induction-illusory-shadow-person"},"altmetric_score":{"score":148.98,"score_history":{"1y":57.08,"6m":54.08,"3m":54.08,"1m":44.08,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":148.98},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8386234,"mean":7.0650459988331,"rank":52179,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8334061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8386234,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7750368,"mean":7.3894972129634,"rank":51587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7698781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7750368,"percentile":99},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48030,"mean":74.862618084907,"rank":6195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":41835,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48030,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47432,"mean":74.239433029032,"rank":6032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":41400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47432,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":20,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":14,"Researcher":54,"Student  > Ph.
