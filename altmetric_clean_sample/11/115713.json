This decision is primarily based on the primary targets and mechanisms of action of the chemical compounds under consideration. Whole-genome expression measurements have shown to be useful for this process but current approaches suffer from requiring either a large number of mutant experiments or a detailed understanding of the regulatory networks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007a9","authors":["Kristofer Hall\u00e9n","Kristofer Hall\u00e9n","Johan Bj\u00f6rkegren","Jesper Tegn\u00e9r"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2105-7-51","issns":["1471-2105"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","last_mentioned_on":1138907024,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2105\/7\/51\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2105-7-51.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1403807","pmid":"16451737","pubdate":"2006-02-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Computer Science"],"startpage":"51","subjects":["computationalbiology"],"title":"Detection of compound mode of action by computational integration of whole-genome measurements and genetic perturbations","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-compound-mode-action-computational-integration-wholegenome-measurements-genetic-perturbati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.032,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.032},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":596852,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3030343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2726417,"mean":5.2299154208336,"rank":490127,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":2235476,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2726417,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2289,"mean":4.2794291958042,"rank":543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":1746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2289,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2161,"mean":4.3540842592593,"rank":538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2161,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
