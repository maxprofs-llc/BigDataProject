This lifespan extension, the largest yet reported in any organism, requires the activity of a second gene, daf-16. Both genes also regulate formation of the dauer larva, a developmentally arrested larval form that is induced by crowding and starvation and is very long-lived. Our findings raise the possibility that the longevity of the dauer is not simply a consequence of its arrested growth, but instead results from a regulated lifespan extension mechanism that can be uncoupled from other aspects of dauer formation. daf-2 and daf-16 provide entry points into understanding how lifespan can be extended.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1993Natur.366..461K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","authors":["Cynthia Kenyon","Jean Chang","Erin Gensch","Adam Rudner","Ramon Tabtiang","Kenyon, C","Chang, J","Gensch, E","Rudner, A","Tabtiang, R","Kenyon C","Chang J","Gensch E","Rudner A","Tabtiang R"],"doi":"10.1038\/366461a0","endpage":"464","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0028-0836","${footerJournalISSN}","${footerJournalEISSN}","1476-4687"],"issue":"6454","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1502002593,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/366461a0","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v366\/n6454\/abs\/366461a0.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8247153","https:\/\/www.omicsonline.org\/references\/a-c-elegans-mutant-that-lives-twice-as-long-as-wild-type-1617145.html","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8247153","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/nature\/journal\/v366\/n6454\/abs\/366461a0.html"],"pmid":"8247153","pubdate":"1993-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"461","subjects":["science"],"title":"A C. elegans mutant that lives twice as long as wild type","type":"article","volume":"366","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c-elegans-mutant-lives-twice-long-wild-type"},"altmetric_score":{"score":77.858,"score_history":{"1y":45.08,"6m":42.08,"3m":8,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":77.858},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":114865,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":8216430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7698182,"mean":7.3451763334672,"rank":113258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7584924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7698182,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47889,"mean":74.612498412964,"rank":9826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":38063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47889,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47295,"mean":74.020425677676,"rank":9543,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":37752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47295,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":7,"Professor > Associate Professor":33,"Researcher":120,"Student  > Doctoral Student":26,"Student  > Ph.
