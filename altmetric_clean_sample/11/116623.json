PubNet supports the creation of complex networks derived from the contents of individual citations, such as genes, proteins, Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and authors. This feature allows one to, for example, examine a literature derived network of genes based on functional similarity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6ec3cf058f610009ffb","authors":["Douglas SM","Montelione GT","Gerstein M","Shawn M Douglas","Gaetano T Montelione","Mark Gerstein"],"doi":"10.1186\/gb-2005-6-9-r80","issns":["1465-6906","14656906"],"issue":"9","journal":"Genome Biology (Online Edition)","last_mentioned_on":1427448077,"links":["http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2005\/6\/9\/R80","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16168087","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16168087"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genomebiology.com\/content\/pdf\/gb-2005-6-9-r80.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1242215","pmid":"16168087","pubdate":"2005-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"R80","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"PubNet: a flexible system for visualizing literature derived networks.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pubnet-flexible-system-visualizing-literature-derived-networks"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.456,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.456},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4927808,"mean":5.8496558347391,"rank":276647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":4651171,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4927808,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3904680,"mean":6.6024383822629,"rank":253818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3650845,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3904680,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1899,"mean":17.754747102213,"rank":479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1899,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1777,"mean":18.762543918919,"rank":478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1299,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1777,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
