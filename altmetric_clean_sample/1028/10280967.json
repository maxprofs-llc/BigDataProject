Blood samples were taken pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise, and 2\u2009h post-exercise from which plasma concentrations of study variables were measured. Immediately and 2\u2009h post-exercise, increases were observed in epinephrine (control group only) norepinephrine (both groups), lactate (both groups), and FFA (both groups immediately post-exercise; breast cancer survivor group only at 2\u2009h post-exercise) (p<0.05). Cortisol decreased immediately and 2\u2009h post-exercise in the control group while glucose decreased immediately post-exercise in the breast cancer survivor group (p<0.05). In conclusion, breast cancer survivors appeared to display attenuated epinephrine, cortisol, and lactate responses while displaying larger magnitude changes in glucose and FFA responses compared to controls. These preliminary findings may have implications for the regulation of metabolism during exercise in breast cancer survivors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ba9","authors":["Evans, E S","Hackney, A C","Pebole, M M","McMurray, R G","Muss, H B","Deal, A M","Battaglini, C L","E.
