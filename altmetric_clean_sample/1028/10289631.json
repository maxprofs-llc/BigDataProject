N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme catalyses two acetylation reactions in INH metabolism and NAT2 gene polymorphism leads to slow and rapid acetylators. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of allelic variants of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene as a predisposing factor for phenytoin toxicity in patients with TBM or tuberculoma having seizures, and taking INH and phenytoin simultaneously.\nSixty patients with TBM or tuberculoma with seizures and taking INH and phenytoin simultaneously for a minimum period of seven days were included in study. Plasma phenytoin was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. NAT2 gene polymorphism was studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism and allele specific PCR.\nThe patients were grouped into those having phenytoin intoxication and those with normal phenytoin level, and also classified as rapid or slow acetylators by NAT2 genotyping. Genotypic analysis showed that of the seven SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of NAT2 gene studied, six mutations were found to be associated with phenytoin intoxication. For rs1041983 (C282T), rs1799929 (C481T), rs1799931 (G857A), rs1799930 (G590A), rs1208 (A803G) and rs1801280 (T341C) allelic variants, the proportion of homozygous mutant was higher in phenytoin intoxicated group than in phenytoin non-intoxicated group.\nHomozygous mutant allele of NAT2 gene at 481site may act as a predisposing factor for phenytoin intoxication among TBM or tuberculoma patients having seizures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aad","authors":["Adole, Prashant S","Kharbanda, Parampreet S","Sharma, Sadhna"],"doi":"10.4103\/0971-5916.187106","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T21:42:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"5","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1474244153,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27488001?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27488001","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"581","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphism as a predisposing factor for phenytoin intoxication in tuberculous meningitis or tuberculoma patients having seizures - A pilot study","type":"article","volume":"143","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nacetyltransferase-2-nat2-gene-polymorphism-predisposing-factor-phenytoin-intoxication-tuberculous-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8421960,"mean":7.0860234078473,"rank":4251991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3952838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8421960,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259638,"mean":12.015298998216,"rank":129703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":119209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259638,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":716,"mean":3.6313734265734,"rank":284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":716,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.8842105263158,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Immunology and Microbiology":2,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/761678833175056386","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10289631],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T21:42:39+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
