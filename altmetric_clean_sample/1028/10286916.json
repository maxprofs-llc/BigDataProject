Investigation of the effectiveness of EA in a leptin-enriched model might have been given a little interest. Here in, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of EA in the presence of leptin to reflect on therapeutic use of EA in obesity-linked colon cancer. Proven effective in leptin-enriched microenvironment, EA inhibited cell proliferation of HCT-116 and CaCo-2 cell lines, modulated cell cycle, translocated Bax to the mitochondrial fraction of cells, activated caspase-8, and reduced PCNA expression. The current study findings cast a beam of light on the potential therapeutic use of EA in obesity-related colon carcinogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008c15","authors":["Yousef, Amany I","El-Masry, Omar S","Yassin, Eman H"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13277-016-5284-7","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T17:59:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0380","1010-4283"],"journal":"Tumor Biology","last_mentioned_on":1470374403,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27460082"],"pmid":"27460082","pubdate":"2016-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The anti-oncogenic influence of ellagic acid on colon cancer cells in leptin-enriched microenvironment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antioncogenic-influence-ellagic-acid-colon-cancer-cells-leptinenriched-microenvironment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8170298,"mean":6.9145785001388,"rank":7070861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8170298,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257062,"mean":11.980800300317,"rank":217083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257062,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1971,"mean":1.2517512690355,"rank":1149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1971,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":2.0578703703704,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"The anti-oncogenic influence of ellagic acid on colon cancer cells in leptin-enriched microenvironment.
