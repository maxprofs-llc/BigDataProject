It may also occur in newborns whose mothers are undergoing substitution therapy.\nTo determine the presence of active ear acupuncture points in newborn infants with NAS.\nAmong newborn infants with NAS admitted to the Division of Neonatology at the University Hospital Graz between March 2009 and November 2014, an acupuncture-point detector (PS3 Silberbauer, Vienna, Austria) was used to identify active ear acupuncture points. An integrated optical and acoustical signal detects the ear points, which were then assigned to the ear map. A total of 31 newborn infants were assessed; 1 infant was excluded, however, because the mother had already weaned herself off opiates before admission.\nThe excluded infant did not develop signs of NAS, had a low Finnegan score (3 points), and did not present any detectable active psychic ear acupuncture points. In all included newborn infants with NAS, active ear acupuncture points were identified: The psychovegetative rim was the most common active somatic area in each infant, followed by a few somatic and psychic ear acupuncture points. In all infants with symptoms of NAS, active psychic ear points were identified, of which the most frequently found points were the Frustration point and the R point.\nThe activity of psychic ear acupuncture points may be specific for neonates with NAS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c79","authors":["Kurath-Koller, Stefan","Pansy, Jasmin","Mileder, Lukas P","Schm\u00f6lzer, Georg M","Urlesberger, Berndt","Raith, Wolfgang","Kurath-KollerStefan"],"doi":"10.1089\/acm.2016.0075","endpage":"793","first_seen_on":"2016-08-05T13:25:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-7708","1075-5535"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1480685311,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27486672","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27486672?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/acm.2016.0075"],"pmid":"27486672","pubdate":"2016-08-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"788","subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Active Somatic and Psychic Ear Acupuncture Points in Newborn Infants with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-somatic-psychic-ear-acupuncture-points-newborn-infants-neonatal-abstinence-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.5,"score_history":{"1y":12.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7836572,"mean":6.6415682037409,"rank":605033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7227008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7836572,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254081,"mean":11.790504148299,"rank":30401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":223533,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254081,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1500,"mean":12.803883922615,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":1194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1500,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":12.482285714286,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Blue_Wode\/statuses\/761553723093032960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10283341],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T13:25:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Blue Wode","url":"http:\/\/www.ebm-first.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/617918667\/twitterProfilePhoto_normal.jpg","description":"Editor of an anti-quackery website with a strong focus on chiropractic.","id_on_source":"Blue_Wode","tweeter_id":"35760477","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":2868},"tweet_id":"761553723093032960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/zak_acupuncture\/statuses\/761677386182225920","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10283341],"posted_on":"2016-08-05T21:36:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Zak Acupuncture","url":"http:\/\/acupuncturelondon.wix.com\/harleystreet","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667699592989974530\/0sFTRnxf_normal.jpg","description":"London's Acupuncturist.Former medical doctor with 30 years experience.
