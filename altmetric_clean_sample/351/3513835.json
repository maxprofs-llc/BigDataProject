The first step involves enzymatic conversion of retinol to retinaldehyde. The physiological significance and relative contributions of the various retinol dehydrogenases to the oxidation of retinol in epidermal cells remain unclear. We report the characterization of a retinol dehydrogenase\/reductase of the SDR superfamily, hRoDH-E2, which is abundantly expressed in the epidermis, epidermal appendages and in cultured epidermal keratinocytes. Both in live keratinocytes and in isolated keratinocyte microsomes, where the enzyme normally localizes, hRoDH-E2 functions as a bona fide retinol dehydrogenase. In the prevailing oxidative reaction it recognizes both free- and CRBP-bound retinol, and shows preference toward NADP as a co-substrate. In comparison, hRoDH-E2 retinol dehydrogenase activity in the simple epithelial HEK 293 cells is much lower and in CHO cells is non-existent. hRoDH-E2 transcripts are distributed throughout the epidermal layers but are more abundant in the basal cells. In contrast, the protein is detected predominantly in the basal and the most differentiated living layers. Its synthesis is negatively regulated by retinoic acid. The biochemical properties and the differential expression of hRoDH-E2 in the strata where retinoic acid signaling is critical for epidermal homeostasis support a conclusion that hRoDH-E2 bears the characteristics of the major microsomal retinol dehydrogenase activity in the epidermal keratinocytes in physiological circumstances.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003113","authors":["Nedialka G Markova","A Pinkas-Sarafova","N Karaman-Jurukovska","V Jurukovski","M Simon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T19:23:39+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-7192"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Genetics & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1200379082,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12618084"],"pmid":"12618084","pubdate":"2003-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Expression pattern and biochemical characteristics of a major epidermal retinol dehydrogenase.","type":"article","volume":"78","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-pattern-biochemical-characteristics-major-epidermal-retinol-dehydrogenase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95368,"mean":8.1856544507012,"rank":24787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69491,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95368,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":565,"mean":2.4015035460993,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":565,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.6807692307692,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Associate Professor":1,"Assistant Professor":1,"Ph.D. Student":3},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":5}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"DHRS9","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=184436891#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3513834,3513835],"posted_on":"2008-01-15T06:38:02+00:00","summary":"Dehydrogenase\/reductase SDR family member 9 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the DHRS9 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15227728","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
