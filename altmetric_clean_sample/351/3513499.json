However, the function of LIMD1 is unknown. Here we show that LIMD1 specifically interacts with retinoblastoma protein (pRB), inhibits E2F-mediated transcription, and suppresses the expression of the majority of genes with E2F1-responsive elements. LIMD1 blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo and is down-regulated in the majority of human lung cancer samples tested. Our data indicate that LIMD1 is a tumor-suppressor gene, the protein product of which functionally interacts with pRB and the loss of which promotes lung carcinogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004PNAS..10116531S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Tyson V.
