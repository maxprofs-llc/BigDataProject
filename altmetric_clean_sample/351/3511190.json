We recently reported that impaired p63 expression is a common feature of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinomas and associates with reduced beta-catenin. On the basis of these facts, we proposed that impaired p63 expression contributes to biological aggressiveness of urothelial neoplasms. Uroplakin (UP) III expression was also evaluated to investigate a possible association between loss of p63 expression and terminal urothelial differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Koga F","Kawakami S","Fujii Y","Saito K","Ohtsuka Y","Iwai A","Ando N","Takizawa T","Kageyama Y","Kihara K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T17:49:01+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"15","journal":"Clinical Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1199566681,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14654529"],"pmid":"14654529","pubdate":"2003-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Impaired p63 expression associates with poor prognosis and uroplakin III expression in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impaired-p63-expression-associates-poor-prognosis-uroplakin-iii-expression-invasive-urothelial-carci"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816218,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95599,"mean":8.1954197368148,"rank":24884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95599,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3398,"mean":3.9377262290256,"rank":960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":1906,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3398,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":9.3485833333333,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
