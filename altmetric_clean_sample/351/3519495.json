Susceptibility of the strains to amodiaquine was correlated with susceptibility to chloroquine (r2 = 0.96). Similarly, accumulation of amodiaquine was correlated with accumulation of chloroquine (r2 = 0.94). Accumulation of both chloroquine and amodiaquine was significantly reduced in chloroquine-resistant isolates (p < 0.005). For the panel of isolates, the accumulation ratio of both drugs was inversely proportional to drug susceptibility (r2 = 0.963 and 0.994 for amodiaquine and chloroquine, respectively). Time course studies highlighted a reduced initial rate of amodiaquine accumulation in chloroquine-resistant isolates compared with chloroquine-susceptible isolates, with no evidence of an enhanced drug efflux rate. Daunomycin, a modulator of parasite chloroquine transport, significantly increased steady state accumulation of both drugs in chloroquine-resistant isolates and, to a lesser extent, in chloroquine-susceptible isolates. Furthermore, daunomycin increased the initial rate of accumulation of amodiaquine in both chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible isolates. Resistance to 4-aminoquinoline drugs is associated with reduced drug permeability rather than enhanced cellular exit of preaccumulated drug, and daunomycin seems to increase the permeability of parasites to aminoquinolines. A new model of 4-aminoquinoline resistance is proposed to take account of these and earlier observations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e7","authors":["P G Bray","S R Hawley","S A Ward"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T22:22:28+00:00","issns":["0026-895X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Molecular Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1203578955,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8967977"],"pmid":"8967977","pubdate":"1996-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"4-Aminoquinoline resistance of Plasmodium falciparum: insights from the study of amodiaquine uptake.","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/4aminoquinoline-resistance-plasmodium-falciparum-insights-study-amodiaquine-uptake"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":815909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96239,"mean":8.2468710280764,"rank":25175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96239,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":913,"mean":2.8564407894737,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":913,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.0789473684211,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
