Fragmentation of 32P-labelled (activated)C1r followed by N-terminal sequence and mass spectrometry analyses allowed identification of Ser189 as the phosphorylation site. Accessibility of Ser189 was low in intact C1r, due in part to the presence of one of the oligosaccharides borne by the alpha region, further reduced in the presence of calcium, and abolished when C1r was incorporated into the C1s-C1r-C1r-C1s tetramer or the C1 complex. In contrast, phosphorylation was enhanced in the isolated alpha fragment and insensitive to calcium. Taken together, these data provide support for the occurrence of a (Ca2+)-dependent interaction between the alpha region and the remainder of the C1r molecule.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00403-6","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T22:26:25+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1203708593,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00403-6","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8635594"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/0014579396004036\/pdf","pmid":"8635594","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of a cryptic protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation site in human complement protease Clr, and its use to probe intramolecular interaction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-cryptic-protein-kinase-ck2-phosphorylation-site-human-complement-protease-c1r-probe-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.93425642237,"rank":816638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2284678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94426,"mean":7.604731564734,"rank":24106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94426,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6252700471698,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3653846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
