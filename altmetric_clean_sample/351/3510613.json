Three proteins are known to be part of the synthase complex: DPM 1, DPM2 and DPM3. Only mutations in DPM1, the catalytic subunit, have been described in three families. One was homozygous for the c274C>G (R92G) mutation in DPM1 and two others were compound heterozygous for R92G and a c628delC deletion or a c331-343del13, respectively. Clinical features were a severe infantile encephalopathy, early intractable seizures, acquired microcephaly, and some dysmorphic features. We report a patient with milder symptoms: microcephaly, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, optic atrophy, and cerebellar dysfunction without cerebellar atrophy. The patient is homozygous for a new mutation in exon 9 of the DPM1 gene (c742T>C (S248P)). Our findings extend the spectrum of CDG Ie.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cda","authors":["Garc\u00eda-Silva MT","Matthijs G","Schollen E","Cabrera JC","Sanchez del Pozo J","Mart\u00ed Herreros M","Sim\u00f3n R","Maties M","Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez E","Hennet T","Briones P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T17:26:12+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease","last_mentioned_on":1199570567,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15669674"],"pmid":"15669674","pubdate":"2005-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) type Ie.
