This study provides a comprehensive review of this phenomenon supported by original data on the Ag concentrations of macrofungi from pristine and Ag-polluted areas. In pristine areas, the median Ag concentrations of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprobic (SAP) macrofungi were 0.79 and 2.94 mg kg(-1), respectively. In these areas, hyperaccumulation thresholds for Ag in ECM and SAP macrofungi are proposed as 100 and 300 mg kg(-1), respectively. In a Ag-polluted area, the Ag concentrations in macrofungi (ECM and SAP) were significantly elevated with the median value of 24.7 mg kg(-1) and the highest concentrations in Amanita spp. of the section Vaginatae (304-692 mg kg(-1)). The intracellular speciation of Ag in fruit-bodies of the Ag-accumulator Amanita submembranacea was inspected by size exclusion chromatography followed by sulfhydryl-specific fluorimetric assays of ligands using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and improved polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Virtually all Ag was found to be intracellular and sequestered in the major 7 kDa and minor 3.3 kDa complexes. The lack of glutathione and phytochelatins and the presence of a single 3 kDa sulfhydryl-containing peptide in the isolated Ag-complexes suggest that detoxification of Ag in A. submembranacea may rely on metallothionein. Vertical distribution of Ag in a polluted forest soil profile has shown substantial enrichment in organic horizons; in polluted technosol, the highest Ag concentrations were found in surface layers. Standardized EDTA extraction of Ag in both the investigated soil profiles showed relatively low Ag extractibility, generally within the range of 2.2-7.7% of total Ag content.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100034e7","doi":"10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2010.02.031","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T19:53:15+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Science of the Total Environment","last_mentioned_on":1349551403,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scitotenv.2010.02.031","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20303145"],"pmid":"20303145","pubdate":"2010-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Bioaccumulation of silver in ectomycorrhizal and saprobic macrofungi from pristine and polluted areas.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioaccumulation-silver-ectomycorrhizal-saprobic-macrofungi-pristine-polluted-areas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628172,"mean":4.9437236464363,"rank":817265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287739,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628172,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95158,"mean":8.1603233393236,"rank":24702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95158,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1441,"mean":3.4972513888889,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1441,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.6171052631579,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
