An inhibitory signal is generated at the level of the catalytic subunit of the cbb3 cytochrome c oxidase and is transduced through the membrane-localized PrrC polypeptide to the PrrBA two-component activation system, which controls the expression of most of the photosynthesis genes in response to O2. The redox state of the quinone pool is monitored by the redox-active AppA antirepressor protein, which determines the functional state of the PpsR repressor protein. The antirepressor\/repressor system as well as a modulator of AppA function, TspO, together with FnrL and PrrA stringently control photopigment gene expression. These regulatory elements, together with spectral complex-specific assembly factors, control the ultimate cellular levels and composition of the photosynthetic membrane.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003118","authors":["J I Oh","S Kaplan"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T22:32:31+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0950-382X"],"issue":"5","journal":"Molecular Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1318388462,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11251830"],"pmid":"11251830","pubdate":"2001-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","microbiology"],"title":"Generalized approach to the regulation and integration of gene expression.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/generalized-approach-regulation-integration-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633986,"mean":4.9208287981427,"rank":815881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295977,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633986,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96168,"mean":8.2502501689771,"rank":25139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69926,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96168,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1878,"mean":2.3426872669153,"rank":241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1878,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.16116,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
