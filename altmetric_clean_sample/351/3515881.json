Few proteins from this family have been characterized, and their function remains unclear. In the present work, zeta-crystallins from human and yeast (Zta1p) were expressed, purified and characterized. Both enzymes are able to reduce ortho-quinones in the presence of NADPH but are not active with 2-alkenals. Deletion of the ZTA1 gene makes yeast more sensitive to menadione and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting a role in the oxidative stress response. The human and yeast enzymes specifically bind to adenine-uracil rich elements (ARE) in RNA, indicating that both enzymes are ARE-binding proteins and that this property has been conserved in zeta-crystallins throughout evolution. This supports a role for zeta-crystallins as trans-acting factors that could regulate the turnover of certain mRNAs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c7","authors":["M.
