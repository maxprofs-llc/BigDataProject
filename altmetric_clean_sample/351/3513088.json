Recently, a bio-informatic procedure based on an 'electronic Northern' approach was established to screen expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries for genes differentially expressed in tumour and normal tissues, and identified 450 candidate genes differentially expressed in breast and ovarian cancer. In this report, the validation of an initial set of 40 candidate genes, which were selected due to their localization in chromosomal regions frequently altered in gynaecological tumours, is described. Differential expression of 29 of these genes, including three uncharacterized novel genes, was confirmed by applying cancer profiling arrays with 106 matched pairs of tumour\/normal cDNAs and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 60 clinical specimens. The majority of these differentially expressed genes have not been described previously in the context of breast and ovarian cancer, and may constitute novel diagnostic markers for these tumour entities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Dahl, Edgar","Sadr\u2010Nabavi, Ariane","Klopocki, Eva","Betz, Beate","Grube, Susanne","Kreutzfeld, Rene","Himmelfarb, Marina","An, Han\u2010Xiang","Gelling, Stephen","Klaman, Irina","Hinzmann, Bernd","Kristiansen, Glen","Gr\u00fctzmann, Robert","Kuner, Ruprecht","Petschke, Beate","Rhiem, Kerstin","Wiechen, Kai","Sers, Christine","Wiestler, Otmar","Schneider, Achim","H\u00f6fler, Heinz","N\u00e4hrig, J\u00f6rg","Dietel, Manfred","Sch\u00e4fer, Reinhold","Rosenthal, Andr\u00e9","Schmutzler, Rita","D\u00fcrst, Matthias","Meindl, Alfons","Niederacher, Dieter"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.1687","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T18:51:56+00:00","issns":["1096-9896"],"journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1200368454,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/path.1687","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15586368"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.1687\/pdf","pmid":"15586368","pubdate":"2004-12-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Systematic identification and molecular characterization of genes differentially expressed in breast and ovarian cancer.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-identification-molecular-characterization-genes-differentially-expressed-breast-ovarian-c-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":816057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95830,"mean":8.2100706466729,"rank":24998,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95830,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":736,"mean":2.8399673469388,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":736,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":10.7,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":8}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"EG":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"RAPH1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=184410704#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3513088],"posted_on":"2008-01-15T03:40:54+00:00","summary":"Ras-associated and pleckstrin homology domains-containing protein 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAPH1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15225416","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
