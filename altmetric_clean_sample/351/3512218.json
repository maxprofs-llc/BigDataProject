We examined the effect of proteasome inhibition on IL-10 activation of the IL-10E1 pathway following stimulation of HPCA-10a cells. Treatment of HPCA-10a cells with the proteasome inhibitor, N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-norleucinal (LLnL), led to stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-10 receptor and IL-10E1 following stimulation. Further investigation showed that these stable phosphorylation events were the result of prolonged activation of JAK1 and TYK2 plus IL-10E1. IL-10E1 signaling normally induced the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and LLnL treatment of the HPCA-10a and HPCA-10c cells significantly enhanced IL-10 induction of TIMP-1 levels to block tumor cell invasion in modified Boyden chamber invasion assays. These observations were confirmed using pharmacologic inhibitors by Western blot and ELISAs. In the presence of LLnL, stable phosphorylation of IL-10E1 and induction of TIMP-1 was abrogated if the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, was added. The effect of staurosporine on IL-10E1 phosphorylation and TIMP-1 could be overcome if the phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, was also added, suggesting that phosphorylated IL-10E1 could be stabilized by phosphatase, but not by proteasome inhibition. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that proteasome-mediated protein degradation can modulate the activity of the IL-10E1 pathway and TIMP-1 induction by regulating the deactivation of JAK1\/TYK2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081df","authors":["Mark E Stearns","M Wang","Youji Hu","F U Garcia"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T18:18:29+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1541-7786"],"issue":"9","journal":"Molecular Cancer Research","last_mentioned_on":1200323818,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12861049"],"pmid":"12861049","pubdate":"2003-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms","cellbiology"],"title":"Interleukin-10 activation of the interleukin-10E1 pathway and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression is enhanced by proteasome inhibitors in primary prostate tumor lines.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin10-activation-interleukin10e1-pathway-tissue-inhibitor-metalloproteinase1-expression-enha"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629356,"mean":4.9352152798544,"rank":816513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629356,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95371,"mean":8.1855563384714,"rank":24786,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69495,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95371,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":424,"mean":3.0607375886525,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":424,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":8.9381052631579,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"CSRP2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=184263226#altmetric_citation_9","license":"public","citation_ids":[3512218],"posted_on":"2008-01-14T15:16:58+00:00","summary":"Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CSRP2 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15213268","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
