We studied the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) in the regulation of CCR7-dependent survival. We show that GSK3beta behaves as a proapoptotic regulator in cultured monocyte-derived human DCs and murine splenic DCs in vitro, and in lymph node DCs in vivo. In keeping with its prosurvival role, stimulation of CCR7 induced phosphorylation\/inhibition of GSK3beta, which was mediated by the prosurvival regulator Akt1, but it was independent of ERK1\/2, a key regulator of chemotaxis. Stimulation of CCR7 also induced translocation of two transcription-factor targets of Akt, prosurvival NF-kappaB and proapoptotic FOXO1, to the nucleus and cytosol, respectively, resulting in DCs with a phenotype more resistant to apoptotic stimuli. We analyzed if GSK3beta was able to modulate the mobilizations of these transcription factors. Using pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering RNA, and a construct encoding constitutively active GSK3beta, we show that active GSK3beta fosters and hampers the translocations to the nucleus of FOXO and NF-kappaB, respectively. Inhibition of GSK3beta resulted in the degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB, indicating a mechanism whereby GSK3 can control the translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus. GSK3beta and FOXO interacted in vivo, suggesting that this transcription factor could be a substrate of GSK3. The results provide a novel mechanism whereby active GSK3beta contributes to regulate apoptosis in DCs. They also suggest that upon stimulation of CCR7, Akt-mediated phosphorylation\/inhibition of GSK3beta may be required to allow complete translocations of FOXO and NF-kappaB that confer DCs an extended survival.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Cristina Escribano","Cristina Delgado-Mart\u00edn","Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.0804093","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T18:09:39+00:00","issns":["1550-6606"],"journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1263997499,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4049\/jimmunol.0804093","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19841191"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jimmunol.org\/content\/183\/10\/6282.full.pdf","pmid":"19841191","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"CCR7-dependent stimulation of survival in dendritic cells involves inhibition of GSK3beta.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ccr7dependent-stimulation-survival-dendritic-cells-involves-inhibition-gsk3%CE%B2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633792,"mean":4.9212574058383,"rank":815862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633792,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96114,"mean":8.2471995255587,"rank":25114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96114,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5839,"mean":1.84052004111,"rank":416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":4025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5839,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":1.9739701492537,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
