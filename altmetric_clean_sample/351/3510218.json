The rate and direction of axonal growth is determined by interactions between the highly motile growth cone and environmental cues that can act in either an attractive or a repulsive manner. Locomotion is ultimately dependent upon the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton and an established role for the Rho family of small GTPases in regulating this process in non-neuronal cells identifies them as candidate signalling molecules in growth cones. An inactive form of Rac1 has recently been shown to inhibit the 'growth-cone collapse' response induced by chick Sema3A, a protein that has recently been established as an important guidance cue. The molecular basis for this inhibition remains unclear.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002660","authors":["I V\u00e4strik","B J Eickholt","F S Walsh","A Ridley","P Doherty"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T17:10:38+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0960-9822"],"issue":"18","journal":"Current Biology","last_mentioned_on":1199581957,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10508610"],"pmid":"10508610","pubdate":"1999-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Sema3A-induced growth-cone collapse is mediated by Rac1 amino acids 17-32.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sema3ainduced-growthcone-collapse-mediated-rac1-amino-acids-1732"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9190323311044,"rank":816208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96322,"mean":8.2419711381735,"rank":25206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96322,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4858,"mean":15.728323244801,"rank":1911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":2101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4858,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":70.848385964912,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
