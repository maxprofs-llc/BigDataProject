Rising numbers of people surviving stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) mean the numbers of people with non-progressive dysarthria are likely to increase, with increased challenges for speech and language therapists (SLTs), service providers and key stakeholders. The evidence base for assessment and intervention approaches with this population remains limited with clinical guidelines relying largely on clinical experience, expert opinion and limited research. Furthermore, there is currently little evidence on the practice behaviours of SLTs available.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b67","authors":["Conway, Aifric","Walshe, Margaret","Conway A","Walshe M"],"doi":"10.1111\/1460-6984.12143","endpage":"388","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T21:48:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1460-6984","1368-2822"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Language & Communication Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1430951026,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1460-6984.12143\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1460-6984.12143"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1460-6984.12143\/pdf","pmid":"25652223","pubdate":"2015-02-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Linguistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"374","subjects":["speechlanguagepathology"],"title":"Management of non\u2010progressive dysarthria: practice patterns of speech and language therapists in the Republic of Ireland","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-nonprogressive-dysarthria-practice-patterns-speech-language-therapists-republic-ireland"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6368406,"mean":5.983378228929,"rank":1202475,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5162849,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6368406,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":205805,"mean":8.5443324716721,"rank":49888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":155719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":205805,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":5.8466382978723,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":5.5,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
