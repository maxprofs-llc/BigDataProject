Studies in mouse model systems have shown that the gamma chain of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI gamma) may substitute for the zeta chain in the TCR-CD3 complex of iIEL. This has suggested that the functional properties of these cells may be associated with an altered composition of the TCR-CD3 complex. We therefore analyzed the TCR-CD3 complex of normal human iIEL. One- and two-dimensional non-reducing\/reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, zeta and Fc epsilon RI gamma chain immunoprecipitates of cell surface radiolabeled proteins with subunit-specific antibodies revealed a TCR-CD3 complex without associated Fc epsilon RI gamma chains. Thus, normal human iIEL contain a TCR-CD3 complex that consists predominantly of zeta homodimers in association with the alpha beta TCR and CD3 gamma, delta and epsilon, similar to the majority of peripheral lymphocytes. This indicates that the distinct properties of human iIEL are not associated with substitutions of the Fc epsilon RI gamma chain in the TCR-CD3 complex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b0d","authors":["Steven P.
