However, it is not fully understood to what extent NFkappaB contributes to induction of the metastasis-associated matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) gene and sensitivity to the commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) in CRC. Using the RKO human CRC cell line and two NFkappaB signaling deficient RKO mutants, we investigated NFkappaB's role in the induction of MMP-9 and 5-Fu sensitivity in RKO CRC cells. NFkappaB plays a predominant role in MMP-9 gene induction in RKO cells, as evidenced by the failure of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to induce MMP-9 in either of the NFkappaB signaling mutants. RKO cells exhibit a robust, oscillatory NFkappaB activity in response to TNFalpha not seen in either of the NFkappaB mutant cell lines, which instead demonstrate diminished, nonoscillatory NFkappaB activation. Analysis of TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation and MMP-9 promoter recruitment of the p65 NFkappaB subunit revealed a significant reduction in p65 phosphorylation as well as reduced and altered recruitment of p65 to the MMP-9 gene promoter in the mutants compared to the parental RKO cell line. 5-Fu only activated NFkappaB in the parental RKO cells through induction of IkappaB-kinase (IKK) activity and increased sensitivity to 5-Fu is observed in both NFkappaB mutant lines. Our results suggest that TNFalpha-dependent induction of MMP-9 gene expression is tightly regulated by oscillatory\/cumulative activation of NFkappaB and that 5-Fu stimulates NFkappaB and RKO CRC cell survival through induction of IKK activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e1","authors":["Fukuyama, Ryuichi","Ng, Kwok Peng","Cicek, Muzaffer","Kelleher, Clare","Niculaita, Roxana","Casey, Graham","Sizemore, Nywana"],"doi":"10.1002\/mc.20288","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T18:42:12+00:00","issns":["1098-2744"],"journal":"Molecular Carcinogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1200350722,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/mc.20288","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17186550"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mc.20288\/pdf","pmid":"17186550","pubdate":"2006-12-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"Role of IKK and oscillatory NFkappaB kinetics in MMP-9 gene expression and chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil in RKO colorectal cancer cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-ikk-oscillatory-nfb-kinetics-mmp9-gene-expression-chemoresistance-5fluorouracil-rko-colorectal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9280690829525,"rank":815952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93834,"mean":7.282771626187,"rank":23840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93834,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":288,"mean":1.7039303135889,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":288,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.9763157894737,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
