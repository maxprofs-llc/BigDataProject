The yeast Two-Hybrid system was utilized to identify a protein that interacts with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, designated BMRP. This protein corresponds to a previously known mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRPL41). Binding experiments confirmed the interaction of BMRP to Bcl-2 in mammalian cells. Subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation studies showed that both Bcl-2 and BMRP are localized to the same fractions (fractions that are rich in mitochondria). Northern blot analysis revealed a major bmrp mRNA band of approximately 0.8 kb in several human tissues. Additionally, a larger 2.2 kb mRNA species was also observed in some tissues. Western blot analysis showed that endogenous BMRP runs as a band of 16-17 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Overexpression of BMRP induced cell death in primary embryonic fibroblasts and NIH\/3T3 cells. Transfection of BMRP showed similar effects to those observed by overexpression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bad. BMRP-stimulated cell death was counteracted by co-expression of Bcl-2. The baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 also protected cells from BMRP-induced cell death. These findings suggest that BMRP is a mitochondrial ribosomal protein involved in the regulation of cell death by apoptosis, probably affecting pathways mediated by Bcl-2 and caspases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bc4","authors":["Chintharlapalli, Sudhakar R.","Jasti, Madhuri","Malladi, Srinivas","Parsa, Kishore V.L.","Ballestero, Rafael P.","Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Garc\u00eda, Maribel"],"doi":"10.1002\/jcb.20292","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T18:51:49+00:00","issns":["1097-4644"],"journal":"Journal of Cellular Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1200368378,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jcb.20292","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15547950"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jcb.20292\/pdf","pmid":"15547950","pubdate":"2004-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"BMRP is a Bcl-2 binding protein that induces apoptosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bmrp-bcl2-binding-protein-induces-apoptosis-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9199904968162,"rank":815910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96238,"mean":8.2453784303336,"rank":25166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69969,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96238,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":868,"mean":1.839321799308,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":868,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.0494,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
