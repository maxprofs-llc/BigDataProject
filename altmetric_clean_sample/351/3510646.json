Based on its domain structure, mst-3 belongs to the SPS1 subgroup of STE20-like proteins, which includes germinal center (GC) kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK), kinase homologous to STE20\/SPS-1 (KHS), kinases responsive to stress (KRS1\/2), the mammalian STE20-like kinases (mst1\/2), and the recently published STE20\/oxidant stress response kinase SOK-1. mst-3 is most closely related to SOK-1, with 88% amino acid similarity in the kinase domain. The similarity of the mst-3 kinase domain to STE20 is 42%. The mst-3 transcript is ubiquitously expressed, and the protein was found in all human, mouse, and monkey cell lines tested. An in vitro kinase assay showed that mst-3 can phosphorylate basic exogenous substrates as well as itself. Interestingly, mst-3 prefers Mn2+ to Mg2+ as a divalent cation and can use both GTP and ATP as phosphate donors. Like SOK-1, mst-3 is activated by autophosphorylation. However, a physiological stimulus of mst-3 activity was not identified. mst-3 activity does not change upon exposure to several mitogenic and stress stimuli. Overexpression of mst-3 wild-type or kinase dead protein affects neither the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1\/2 or ERK6), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, nor pp70S6 kinase, suggesting that mst-3 is part of a novel signaling pathway.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["K Schinkmann","J Blenis"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T17:27:39+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"45","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1199569090,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9353338"],"pmid":"9353338","pubdate":"1997-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning and characterization of a human STE20-like protein kinase with unusual cofactor requirements.","type":"article","volume":"272","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-characterization-human-ste20like-protein-kinase-unusual-cofactor-requirements"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":817332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95114,"mean":8.1484618506409,"rank":24684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95114,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6449034627866,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
