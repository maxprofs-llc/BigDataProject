The beta 3 subunit gene is > 50 kb in size and is split into 7 exons. The exon\/intron organization of the beta 3 subunit gene is identical to that of the Na,K-ATPase beta 3 subunit gene, indicating that these two genes evolved from a common evolutionary ancestor. Comparison of the promoter region of the human and mouse beta 3 subunit gene reveals a high degree of homology within a 300-bp segment located immediately upstream of the translation start site, suggesting that control elements that serve to regulate the cell-specific expression of the beta 3 subunit gene are likely to be located within this conserved region. Dot blot analysis of beta 3 subunit transcripts revealed expression within virtually all human tissues, while in situ hybridization showed expression of beta 3 mRNA in both neurons and glia of rat brain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with PAC DNA clones localized ATP1B3 to the q22-->23 region of Chromosome (Chr) 3, and the beta 3 pseudogene to the p13-->15 region of Chr 2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037b5","authors":["N Malik","V Canfield","G Sanchez-Watts","A G Watts","S Scherer","B G Beatty","P Gros","R Levenson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T17:41:25+00:00","issns":["0938-8990"],"issue":"2","journal":"Mammalian Genome","last_mentioned_on":1199558598,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9457675"],"pmid":"9457675","pubdate":"1998-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Structural organization and chromosomal localization of the human Na,K-ATPase beta 3 subunit gene and pseudogene.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-organization-chromosomal-localization-human-nakatpase-beta-3-subunit-gene-pseudogene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630293,"mean":4.9302727339889,"rank":816217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630293,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95599,"mean":8.1954286282142,"rank":24884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95599,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":2.6315771065183,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CL":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ATP1B3","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=182348968#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3510991,3510992],"posted_on":"2008-01-05T18:43:18+00:00","summary":"Sodium\/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ATP1B3 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15062801","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
