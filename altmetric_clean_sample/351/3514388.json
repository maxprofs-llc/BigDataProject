In contrast to rodents that possess several NKR-P1 genes coding for either activating or inhibitory receptors, the nature of signals delivered by the single human NKR-P1A receptor is still to be clarified. In this article, we show that the lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1) molecule is a ligand for the CD161 receptor. Engagement of CD161 on NK cells with LLT1 expressed on target cells inhibited NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma secretion. Conversely, LLT1\/CD161 interaction in the presence of a TCR signal enhanced IFN-gamma production by T cells. These findings identify a novel ligand\/receptor pair that differentially regulate NK and T cell functions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Hatice Aldemir","Virginie Prod\u2019homme","Marie-Jeanne Dumaurier","Christelle Retiere","Gwenola Poupon","Julie Cazareth","Franck Bihl","Veronique M.
