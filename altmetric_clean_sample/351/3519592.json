A lambda gt10 cDNA library of mRNA from IFN-induced Daudi lymphoblastoid cells was screened with oligonucleotide probes. Several overlapping cDNAs were isolated and shown to be derived from the human synthetase gene using filter selection and oocyte microinjection assays. The nucleotide sequence of one of these, cDNA 8-2, extended the 2-5A synthetase sequence already described 72 bp in the 5' direction but was found to differ significantly in coding sequence at the 3' end. The longest cDNA isolated (6-2) was approximately 1.4 kb. By Northern hybridization analysis single mRNAs of 1.7 kb were detected in Daudi and T98G (glioblastoma) cells. However, in HeLa cells, four mRNAs ranging in size from 1.5 to 3.5 kb were found, one of which differed at the 3' end. Analysis of both phage and cosmid genomic clones and comparison with genomic DNA indicate that there is a single gene for 2-5A synthetase, comprising at least six exons and five introns, which can undergo a novel form of alternative RNA processing depending on cell type.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["M E Saunders","D R Gewert","M E Tugwell","M McMahon","B R Williams"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T22:25:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0261-4189"],"issue":"7","journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1195428187,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2411547","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC554415"],"pmcid":"PMC554415","pmid":"2411547","pubdate":"1985-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Human 2-5A synthetase: characterization of a novel cDNA and corresponding gene structure.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-25a-synthetase-characterization-novel-cdna-corresponding-gene-structure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":817716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94911,"mean":8.1223476556739,"rank":24608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94911,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3999,"mean":3.2006628314157,"rank":592,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1728,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3999,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":7.5704545454545,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
