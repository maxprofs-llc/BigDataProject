Using conventional and affinity chromatography, we have isolated a human coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence. Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16 activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA Pol II via the CTD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["Anders M.
