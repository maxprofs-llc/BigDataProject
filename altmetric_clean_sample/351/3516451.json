The paired box domain encodes a DNA binding motif, indicating that PAX proteins may function as transcriptional regulators, participating in a hierarchical network of gene regulation during embryogenesis. In this report, we provide evidence that there is an additional conserved region near the predicted COOH-terminus of PAX-2, PAX-5, and PAX-8. We also describe alternative splicing of a conserved 83-nucleotide segment in the 3' coding sequence of the PAX-2 gene. PAX-2 transcripts that contain the 83-nucleotide insertion encode a putative protein with an alternative COOH-terminus. The presence of an additional conserved region and alternative splicing within the predicted COOH-terminal region of several PAX genes has implications for the evolutionary origins and for the DNA binding site specificity of PAX-2, PAX-5, and PAX-8.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1b","authors":["T A Ward","A Nebel","A E Reeve","M R Eccles"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T21:06:38+00:00","issns":["1044-9523"],"issue":"9","journal":"Cell Growth & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1195329678,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7819127"],"pmid":"7819127","pubdate":"1994-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Alternative messenger RNA forms and open reading frames within an additional conserved region of the human PAX-2 gene.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-messenger-rna-forms-open-reading-frames-within-additional-conserved-region-human-pax2-ge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95481,"mean":8.1909574570593,"rank":24827,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95481,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":2.4615384615385,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
