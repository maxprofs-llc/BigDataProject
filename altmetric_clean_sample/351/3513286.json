The erythroid-specific transcriptional network that regulates Bcl-x(L) expression in erythropoiesis remains unclear. The activation of the central erythropoietic transcriptional factor, GATA-1, leads to the early, transient induction of a transcription repressor, Gfi-1B, followed by the late induction of Bcl-x(L) during erythroid maturation in G1ER cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that a constant level of GATA-1 binds to the Bcl-x promoter throughout the entire induction period, while Gfi-1B is transiently associated with the promoter in the early phase. The sustained expression of Gfi-1B abolished GATA-1-induced Bcl-x(L) expression. Here, we present evidence that GATA-1 binds to the noncanonical GATT motif of the Bcl-x promoter for trans-activation. Gfi-1B expressed at increased levels is recruited to the Bcl-x promoter through its association with GATA-1, suppressing Bcl-x(L) transcription. Therefore, the down-regulation of Gfi-1B in the late phase of erythroid maturation is necessary for Bcl-x(L) induction. Furthermore, we show that the inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase by treatment with imatinib caused the up-regulation of Gfi-1B in K562 cells, where Gfi-1B also cooperated with GATA-1 to repress Bcl-x(L) transcription. Gfi-1B knockdown by RNA interference diminished imatinib-induced apoptosis, while the overexpression of Gfi-1B sensitized K562 cells to arsenic-induced death. These findings illuminate the role of Gfi-1B in GATA-1-mediated transcription in the survival aspect of erythroid cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310d","authors":["Yuan-Yeh Kuo","Zee-Fen Chang"],"doi":"10.1128\/mcb.02212-06","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T19:00:09+00:00","issns":["1098-5549"],"journal":"Molecular & Cellular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1489147274,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1128\/MCB.02212-06","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17420275","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1900040"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/mcb.asm.org\/content\/27\/12\/4261.full.pdf","pmid":"17420275","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"GATA-1 and Gfi-1B Interplay To Regulate Bcl-xL Transcription","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gata1-gfi1b-interplay-regulate-bclxl-transcription"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":1834210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6442532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245025,"mean":8.393523312002,"rank":60683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":183347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245025,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3947,"mean":2.9270369994932,"rank":295,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3947,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":2.3929454545455,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
