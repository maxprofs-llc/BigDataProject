Here we measured these components of leptin in serum and in the incubation medium of sc adipose tissue in healthy lean (n = 10) and obese (n = 13) female subjects using recently developed specific RIA systems. In addition, immunostaining for FL, BL, and LR in adipose tissue was performed. Serum FL levels were increased in the obese subjects (P < 0.0001), whereas BL and LR concentrations in serum of lean and obese subjects were similar. Both FL and BL were secreted from human preadipocytes and increased in parallel to the differentiation of the cells. In sc fat cell explants LR antibodies predominantly stained the fat cell membrane, whereas FL and BL antibodies revealed intracytoplasmatic adipocyte staining. The release of FL, BL, and LR from adipose tissue was increased in obese compared with lean subjects (P < 0.005 for FL; P < 0.02 for BL, and P < 0.01 for LR). In summary, fat cells are capable of releasing not only FL, but also BL and LR.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be1","authors":["G Brabant","H Nave","B Mayr","M Behrend","V van Harmelen","P Arner"],"doi":"10.1210\/jcem.87.8.8758","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T20:22:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-972X"],"issue":"8","journal":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism","last_mentioned_on":1200960251,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12161541"],"pmid":"12161541","pubdate":"2002-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Secretion of free and protein-bound leptin from subcutaneous adipose tissue of lean and obese women.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secretion-free-proteinbound-leptin-subcutaneous-adipose-tissue-lean-obese-women"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":817527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95043,"mean":8.1286262915344,"rank":24655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95043,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4635,"mean":4.884107034959,"rank":928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4635,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":15.662941176471,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
