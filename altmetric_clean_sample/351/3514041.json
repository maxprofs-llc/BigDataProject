For in vitro and in vivo chemotherapeutic studies, we used the following head and neck cancer cell lines: a mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line, Sq-1979; a human SCC cell line, SCCHA; a mouse salivary gland adenocarcinoma (SGA) cell line, NR-PG; and a human SGA cell line, HSY. We used a vinca alkaloid anticancer drug, vincristine (VCR), as a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug. To determine the cause of multidrug resistance, Western blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry of xenografted tumors in nude mice, drug efflux analysis, and drug efflux inhibitory assays were performed. VCR-treated cell lines, Sq-1979\/VCR, SCCHA\/VCR, NR-PG\/VCR, and HSY\/VCR, intensively expressed multidrug resistance (MDR) gene 1 mRNA and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP) 1 mRNA. MRP7 mRNA and protein were expressed in NR-PG\/VCR and HSY\/VCR cells, but not in Sq-1979\/VCR and SCCHA\/VCR cells. In each cell clone of NR-PG\/VCR and HSY\/VCR, MRP7 mRNA was induced by VCR treatment, suggesting an acquired resistance to VCR in the context of MRP7 expression. In the in vivo chemotherapeutic nude mice model, VCR-treated xenografted SCCHA and HSY cells expressed MDR1 and MRP1. Moreover, MRP7 expression was immunohistochemically found in xenografted HSY cells of VCR-injected tumor-bearing mice, but not in SCCHA cells. Furthermore, doxorubicin accumulation was increased and drug cross-resistance to docetaxel decreased in HSY\/VCR in the presence of a competitive MRP7 inhibitor, 17-beta-estradiol-(17-beta-D-glucuronide). These results indicate that MDR1 expression, MRP1 expression, and MRP7 expression are refractory factors in head and neck cancer chemotherapy and suggest that induction of MRP7 expression is involved in drug resistance to natural products, especially to docetaxel in SGA.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007977","authors":["Naramoto H","Uematsu T","Uchihashi T","Doto R","Matsuura T","Usui Y","Uematsu S","Li X","Takahashi M","Yamaoka M","Furusawa K"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T19:33:53+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"International Journal of Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1200375659,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17203221"],"pmid":"17203221","pubdate":"2007-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 7 expression is involved in cross-resistance to docetaxel in salivary gland adenocarcinoma cell lines.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multidrug-resistanceassociated-protein-7-expression-involved-crossresistance-docetaxel-salivary-glan"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95274,"mean":8.1736700429294,"rank":24752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95274,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":2.262920598389,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":504,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.6973,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
