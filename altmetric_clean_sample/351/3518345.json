J. 308, 901-908]. This facet was further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis of selected basic residues of human CYP17. The purified mutant proteins were subjected to detailed kinetic analysis. It was found that the mutation of Lys83, Arg347 and Arg358 produced proteins that were deficient in their responsiveness to cytochrome b5, and the effect was most pronounced for the two arginine mutants (Arg347-->His and Arg358-->Gln) which have been found in male patients suffering from genital ambiguity. These residues are invoked to mediate protein-protein interaction between cytochrome b5 and CYP17, which 'awakens' the lyase activity of the enzyme required for androgen formation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["P Lee-Robichaud","M E Akhtar","M Akhtar"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T21:55:02+00:00","issns":["0264-6021"],"journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1195454898,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9601054","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1219480"],"pmcid":"PMC1219480","pmid":"9601054","pubdate":"1998-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Control of androgen biosynthesis in the human through the interaction of Arg347 and Arg358 of CYP17 with cytochrome b5.","type":"article","volume":"332 ( Pt 2)","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/control-androgen-biosynthesis-human-through-interaction-arg347-arg358-cyp17-cytochrome-b5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":816889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95274,"mean":8.1736894608128,"rank":24752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95274,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3760,"mean":2.4031088055334,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":1494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3760,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.7214285714286,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
