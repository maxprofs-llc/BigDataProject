In this study, the distribution characteristics of UMP in the southern Yellow Sea was investigated, and then a flocculation experiment of UMP using modified clay (MC) was conducted at a selected station of the research cruise. The results indicated that the distribution of green algae thalli is one of the main factors that directly influence UMP distribution. UMP density was strongly negatively correlated with the distance between the sampling station and the centre of the area containing floating Ulva (r=-0.618***, n=83). >80% of the UMP was removed from the water column after MC application at a concentration of 0.1g\/L, and MC applied at a concentration of 0.5g\/L reduced the germination rate to 0.3%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006690","authors":["Jing Li","Xiuxian Song","Yue Zhang","Jun Pan","Zhiming Yu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.marpolbul.2017.01.063","first_seen_on":"2017-02-13T12:07:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0025326X","1879-3363"],"journal":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1486987621,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0025326X17300929"],"pmid":"28187967","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"An investigation of the space distribution of Ulva microscopic propagules and ship-based experiment of mitigation using modified clay","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0025326X17300929","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/investigation-space-distribution-ulva-microscopic-propagules-shipbased-experiment-mitigation-using-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":6229743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1104621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269397,"mean":12.909711383984,"rank":195345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45775,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269397,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2899,"mean":5.3023857832988,"rank":2025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2899,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":5.4661085271318,"rank":94,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBFmasts\/statuses\/831112437185155072","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16357115],"posted_on":"2017-02-13T12:07:01+00:00","author":{"name":"MBF","url":"http:\/\/www.masts.ac.uk\/research\/research-forums\/biogeochemistry-forum\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/529766192618033153\/FOVr80Ps_normal.jpeg","description":"The Marine Biogeochemistry Forum aims to bring together marine biogeochemists, and communicate the importance of marine biogeochemistry to a wider audience.","id_on_source":"MBFmasts","tweeter_id":"2850820803","geo":{"lt":56,"ln":-4,"country":"GB"},"followers":861},"tweet_id":"831112437185155072"}]}}
