Four days earlier he sustained a dog bite to the left hand with localized swelling that rapidly resolved without additional signs of infection. No other source of fever was identified on history and physical examination. He was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of the origin of the fever, including possible endocarditis. Complete cardiac evaluation revealed no valvular infection. On the fifth hospital day, the patient developed severe lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine revealed L4-5 vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis. Blood cultures were positive for Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Antibiotics were continued and recovery was complete and uneventful.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Michael J. Nelson","Richard E.
