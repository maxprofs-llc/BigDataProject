Two hundred seventy-four women with postmenopausal bleeding regardless of endometrial thickness (group 1: symptomatic) and 328 women with an incidental finding of thickened endometrium (\u22655 mm) without bleeding (group 2: asymptomatic) underwent endometrial biopsy for histopathologic examination. The receiver operating characteristics curves of endometrial thickness measurement for prediction of endometrial pathologies were analyzed.\nEndometrial carcinoma was detected in eight women (2.9%) in group 1 and in three (0.9%) in group 2. The best cutoff point for endometrial thickness in predicting endometrial carcinoma in group 1 was 8.2 mm, which provided 75% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.9-92.9%) and 74% specificity (95% CI, 68-78.5%); area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76-1.00%; p = 0.0001. In group 2, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.46-1.00; p = 0.114); the evidence was inconclusive as to the relationship between endometrial thickness and malignancy. For the prediction of polyps, the AUCs of endometrial thickness were 0.77 for group 1 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83%; p = 0.0001) and 0.61 for group 2 (95% CI, 0.54-0.67%; p = 0.002).\nSonographically determined endometrial thickness measurement shows high diagnostic performance for detection of endometrial cancer in symptomatic postmenopausal women at the optimal cutoff thickness of approximately 8 mm, although the evidence supporting the use of sonography for predicting malignancy in asymptomatic women is inconclusive. For polyp detection, this technique shows moderate diagnostic ability in symptomatic women, but its predictive value is low in asymptomatic women. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
