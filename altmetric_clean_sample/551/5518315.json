The generation and persistence of corneal myofibroblasts (contractile cells with reduced transparency) arise from the interaction of cytokines and growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 1 produced by epithelial and stromal cells in response to the corneal injury. Myofibroblasts, and the opaque extracellular matrix they secrete into the stroma, disturb the precise distribution and spacing of collagen fibers related to corneal transparency and lead to the development of vision-limiting corneal opacity (haze). The intact epithelial basement membrane has a pivotal role as a structure that regulates corneal epithelial-stromal interactions. Thus, defective regeneration of the epithelial basement membrane after surgery, trauma, or infection leads to the development of stromal haze. The apoptotic process following laser stromal ablation, which is proportional to the level of attempted correction, leads to an early decrease in anterior keratocyte density and the diminished contribution of these non-epithelial cells of components such as perlecan and nidogen-2 required for normal regeneration of the epithelial basement membrane. Haze persists until late repair of the defective epithelial basement membrane.\nDefective regeneration of the epithelial basement membrane has a critical role in determining whether a cornea heals with late haze after photorefractive keratectomy or with scarring at the flap edge in LASIK.
