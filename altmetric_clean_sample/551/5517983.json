We tested three explanations: (i) the two constructs are actually one; (ii) the correlation is explained by a third factor; (iii) there are prospective relationships between body satisfaction and self-esteem. A population based sample of Norwegian adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a03251) was examined four times over a 13-year period. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that body satisfaction and self-esteem were separate constructs and the correlation between them was not attenuated when adjusting for 3rd variables. Autoregressive cross-lagged analysis showed reciprocal relations between body satisfaction and self-esteem. The prospective relationship between body satisfaction during adolescence and self-esteem in late adolescence and emerging adulthood was stronger than at later stages.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001ca5","authors":["Wichstr\u00f8m, Lars","von Soest, Tilmann"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.adolescence.2015.12.003","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T11:10:06+00:00","issns":["1095-9254","01401971"],"journal":"Journal of Adolescence","last_mentioned_on":1455275387,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0140197115002833"],"pmid":"26713411","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Reciprocal relations between body satisfaction and self-esteem: A large 13-year prospective study of adolescents ","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reciprocal-relations-between-body-satisfaction-selfesteem-large-13year-prospective-study-adolescents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7185566,"mean":6.3172903489115,"rank":5406153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992750,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7185566,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320658,"mean":9.6014863920011,"rank":222470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54267,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320658,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":567,"mean":5.7713074204947,"rank":496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":567,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":16.0745,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
