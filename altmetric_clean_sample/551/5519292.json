In our first model, cooperation consists of the production of a public good, and adversity is linked to the degree of complementarity of the players\u05f3 efforts in producing the public good. In our second model, cooperation consists of the defense of a public, and\/or a private good with by-product benefits, and adversity is measured by the number of random attacks (e.g., by a predator) facing the players. In both of these models, our analysis confirms the existence of the so-called boomerang effect, which states that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally defect in a situation of joint cooperation. Focusing on such an effect in isolation leads to the \"common-enemy\" hypothesis that a larger degree of adversity increases the probability of cooperation. Yet, we also find that a sucker effect may simultaneously exist, which says that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally cooperate in a situation of joint defection. Looked at in isolation, the sucker effect leads to the competing hypothesis that a larger degree of adversity decreases the probability of cooperation. Our analysis predicts circumstances in which the \"common enemy\" hypothesis prevails, and circumstances in which the competing hypothesis prevails.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f77","authors":["De Jaegher, Kris","Hoyer, Britta"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jtbi.2015.12.034","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T15:52:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8541","00225193"],"journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1455292401,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0022519316000424"],"pmid":"26780649","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Medicine","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"By-product mutualism and the ambiguous effects of harsher environments \u2013 A game-theoretic model ","type":"article","volume":"393","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/byproduct-mutualism-ambiguous-effects-harsher-environments-gametheoretic-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7185566,"mean":6.3172903489115,"rank":5151754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1779441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7185566,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320658,"mean":9.6014505281341,"rank":204159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":98188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320658,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1898,"mean":3.4509910384818,"rank":1343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":511,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1898,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":4.296,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
