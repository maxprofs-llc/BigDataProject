More nurses are badly needed."],"citation":{"abstract":"The aim of this project was to develop a quality nurse education programme in Bangladesh. A sustainable social business financial model was used. The project is a collaboration between Glasgow Caledonian University and the Grameen Health Care Trust. It contributes to the UN development agenda, eradication of poverty, sustainability and the development of global partnerships.\nThere is an acute shortage of nurses in Bangladesh but many young women who wish to become nurses are unable to do so. Women are discriminated against, have few leadership opportunities and poverty affects large proportions of rural society.\nThe collaboration between the University and the Trust provides the necessary input to ensure a quality nursing programme. A business plan was developed, competency-based teaching introduced, infrastructure and financial management processes were set-up and an evaluation framework was put in place.\nThe systems evaluation framework monitors the financial status of the College and the effects of the programme on students. The social business model, providing access to educational loans, has enabled 118 students to graduate into employment. The College is currently on target to be financially sustainable by 2016.\nThis project outlines a business model that tackles poverty, gender equality and contributes to the human resource deficit. Young women are equipped as change agents and leaders.\nThe social business model provides a mechanism for releasing funds for education to those who are impoverished. It provides a viable option for increasing the number of well-educated nurse leaders in developing countries.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bc5","authors":["Parfitt, Barbara","Nahar, Niru
