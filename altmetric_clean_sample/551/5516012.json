Lack of reproducible phenotypic and genetic features of malignant myopericytic neoplasms prevented establishment of myopericytic sarcoma as acceptable diagnostic category. Following detection of a LMNA-NTRK1 gene fusion in an index case of paediatric haemangiopericytoma-like sarcoma by combined whole-genome and RNA sequencing, we identified three additional sarcomas harbouring NTRK1 gene fusions, termed as spindle cell sarcoma, NOS with myo-\/haemangiopericytic growth pattern. The patients were two children aged 11 months and 2 years and two adults aged 51 years and 80 years. While the tumours of adults were strikingly myopericytoma-like, but with clear-cut atypical features, paediatric cases were more akin to infantile myofibromatosis\/haemangiopericytoma. All cases contained numerous thick-walled dysplastic-like vessels with segmental or diffuse nodular myxohyaline myointimal proliferations of smooth muscle actin-positive cells occasionally associated with thrombosis. Immunohistochemistry showed variable expression of smooth muscle actin and CD34, but other mesenchymal markers including STAT6 were negative. This study showed a novel variant of myo-\/haemangiopericytic sarcoma with recurrent NTRK1 gene fusions. Given the recent introduction of a novel therapeutic approach targeting NTRK-fusion positive neoplasms, recognition of this rare but likely underreported sarcoma variant is strongly encouraged.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007dc7","authors":["Haller, Florian","Knopf, Jasmin","Ackermann, Anne","Bieg, Matthias","Kleinheinz, Kortine","Schlesner, Matthias","Moskalev, Evgeny A.","Will, Rainer","Satir, Ali Abdel","Abdelmagid, Ibtihalat E.","Giedl, Johannes","Carbon, Roman","Rompel, Oliver","Hartmann, Arndt","Wiemann, Stefan","Metzler, Markus","Agaimy, Abbas","Moskalev, Evgeny A","Abdelmagid, Ibtihalat E","Florian Haller","Jasmin Knopf","Anne Ackermann","Matthias Bieg","Kortine Kleinheinz","Matthias Schlesner","Evgeny A Moskalev","Rainer Will","Ali Abdel Satir","Ibtihalat E Abdelmagid","Johannes Giedl","Roman Carbon","Oliver Rompel","Arndt Hartmann","Stefan Wiemann","Markus Metzler","Abbas Agaimy"],"doi":"10.1002\/path.4701","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T04:50:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1096-9896","00223417"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1455791230,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/path.4701","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/path.4701#.Vr3r_kTbtWY.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fpath.4701#.Vr3r_kTbtWY.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fpath.4701"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/path.4701\/pdf","pmid":"26863915","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Paediatric and adult soft tissue sarcomas with NTRK1 gene fusions: a subset of spindle cell sarcomas unified by a prominent myopericytic\/haemangiopericytic pattern","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/path.4701","volume":"238","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/paediatric-adult-soft-tissue-sarcomas-ntrk1-gene-fusions-subset-spindle-cell-sarcomas-unified-promin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.45,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":1614854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":5587957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321006,"mean":9.6224060995931,"rank":89704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":230618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321006,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":3.3840532110092,"rank":219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":3.7206666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
