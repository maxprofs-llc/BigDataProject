Caring for this population has unique challenges. The goal of the review is to identify factors that may help in the care of geriatric patients suffering from genitourinary trauma.\nMultiple factors lead to inferior outcomes in patients with geriatric trauma including failure to rescue, treatment in lower volume trauma centers, and undertriage of geriatric patients. Improvement in geriatric trauma outcomes occurs with the use of dedicated geriatric consult teams. The surgical management of genitourinary injuries in the geriatric population remains unchanged.\nInterventions for geriatric patients differ from younger populations. Direct changes in overall management of the geriatric population lead to improved outcomes. The treatment of geriatric trauma patients with genitourinary injuries is similar to a younger cohort. The lack of recent studies in clinical outcomes in this population has been identified as a gap in knowledge that will require future research to answer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f610007077","authors":["Metcalf, Meredith","Broghammer, Joshua A"],"doi":"10.1097\/mou.0000000000000268","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T15:27:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-6586","0963-0643"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current Opinion in Urology","last_mentioned_on":1455290815,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-urology\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Genitourinary_trauma_in_geriatric_patients.10.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-urology\/2016\/03000\/Genitourinary_trauma_in_geriatric_patients.10.pdf","pmid":"26814883","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"165","title":"Genitourinary trauma in geriatric patients","type":"article","volume":"26"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7185566,"mean":6.3172903489115,"rank":5406154,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7185566,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320657,"mean":9.6014815627959,"rank":222470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":54261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320657,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":476,"mean":1.6380294736842,"rank":253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":476,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":1.2441379310345,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CO_Urology\/statuses\/698166399168958464","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5518917],"posted_on":"2016-02-12T15:26:55+00:00","author":{"name":"CO Urology","url":"http:\/\/www.co-urology.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1706291245\/MOU_square_cover_normal.jpg","description":"Provides powerful perspectives on the most important advances in published literature, delivering expert assessments of developments from the previous year.","id_on_source":"CO_Urology","tweeter_id":"368390845","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"698166399168958464"}]}}
