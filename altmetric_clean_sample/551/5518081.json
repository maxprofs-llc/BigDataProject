Common histologies were olfactory neuroblastoma (23%), squamous cell carcinoma (22%), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (17%). Advanced stage (T3 in 25% and T4 in 69%) and high-grade histology (51%) were common. Surgical procedures included endoscopic resection alone (45%), endoscopic resection with craniotomy (12%), or open resection (30%).\u00a0Gross residual disease was present in 26% of patients. Most patients received hyperfractionated PT (1.2\u00a0Gy [relative biological effectiveness (RBE)] twice daily, 99%) and chemotherapy (75%).\u00a0The median PT dose was 73.8\u00a0Gy (RBE), with 85% of patients receiving more than 70\u00a0Gy (RBE). Prognostic factors were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards regression for multiple regression. Dosimetric parameters were evaluated using logistic regression. Serious, late grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. The median follow-up was 2.4\u00a0years for all patients and 2.7\u00a0years among living patients.\nThe local control (LC), neck control, freedom from distant metastasis, disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 94%, 73%, 63%, 70%, and 68%, respectively, at 3\u00a0years. Gross total resection and PT resulted in a 90% 3-year LC rate. The 3-year LC rate was 61% for primary radiation therapy and 59% for patients with gross disease. Gross disease was the only significant factor for LC on multivariate analysis, whereas grade and continuous LC were prognostic for overall survival. Six of 12 local recurrences were marginal. Dural dissemination represented 26% of distant recurrences. Late toxicity occurred in 24% of patients (with grade 3 or higher unilateral vision loss in 2%).\nDose-intensified, hyperfractionated PT with or without concurrent chemotherapy results in excellent LC after gross total resection, and results in patients with gross disease are encouraging. Patients with high-grade histology are at greater risk of death from distant dissemination. Continuous LC is a major determinant of survival justifying aggressive local therapy in nearly all cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b96","authors":["Roi Dagan","Curtis Bryant","Zuofeng Li","Daniel Yeung","Jeb Justice","Peter Dzieglewiski","John Werning","Rui Fernandes","Phil Pirgousis","Donald Lanza","Christopher G.
