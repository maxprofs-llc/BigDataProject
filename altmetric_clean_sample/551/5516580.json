The underlying flexibility is attributed to a concerted conformational contraction of up to two thirds of the linkers, which breaks the local lattice symmetry. X-ray scattering data are described well by a nanodomain model in which differently oriented tetragonal-type distortions propagate over about 7-10 unit cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Bueken, Bart","Vermoortele, Frederik","Cliffe, Matthew J.","Wharmby, Michael T.","Foucher, Damien","Wieme, Jelle","Vanduyfhuys, Louis","Martineau, Charlotte","Stock, Norbert","Taulelle, Francis","Van\u2005Speybroeck, Veronique","Goodwin, Andrew L.","De\u2005Vos, Dirk","Cliffe, Matthew J","Wharmby, Michael T","Van Speybroeck, Veronique","Goodwin, Andrew L","De Vos, Dirk","Bart Bueken","Frederik Vermoortele","Matthew J.
