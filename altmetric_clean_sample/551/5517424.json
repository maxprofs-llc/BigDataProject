Treatments used in BD patients may influence the ill phases with different actions on the illness-free interval.\nWe performed a naturalistic mirror-image retrospective study analyzing the number of episodes and admissions in 41 BD patients for the same period of time of 5 years before and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Furthermore, we assessed the duration of free intervals before and after ECT as a sign of prolonged well-being. Univariate analysis with t-test was used to compare differences before and after ECT, while analysis of variance was used to compare factors possibly associated with the efficacy on free-interval of ECT.\nComparing the 5-year periods before and after ECT, we found significantly longer [13.2\u00b19.0 months before ECT to 25.1\u00b119.1 after treatment (t=3.8; p<0.0001)] free intervals, as well as significant reductions in the number of episodes [5.9\u00b13.0 before ECT to 1.0\u00b11.7 after treatment (t=9.3; p<0.0001)], and in the number of admissions [2.2\u00b11.3 before ECT to 0.2\u00b10.5 after treatment (t=9.4; p<0.0001)].\nThe main limitations of this study consisted in the relatively small sample size, the mirror-image retrospective naturalistic study design and possibly patient selection bias.\nElectroconvulsive therapy seemed to increase free-intervals and reduced number of BD episodes and admissions. It is plausible that ECT, along with suspending antidepressant treatment, might carry intrinsic stabilizing effect on the course of BD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c6c","authors":["Gian Paolo Minnai","Piergiorgio Salis","Mirko Manchia","Martina Pinna","Leonardo Tondo","Minnai, Gian Paolo","Salis, Piergiorgio","Manchia, Mirko","Pinna, Martina","Tondo, Leonardo"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jad.2016.02.027","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T08:23:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0165-0327","1573-2517"],"journal":"Journal of Affective Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1456219873,"links":["http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165-0327(15)30695-9\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26896811?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26896811"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jad-journal.com\/article\/S0165032715306959\/pdf","pmid":"26896811","pubdate":"2016-02-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"What happens to the course of bipolar disorder after electroconvulsive therapy?","type":"article","volume":"195","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/happens-course-bipolar-disorder-after-electroconvulsive-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7252957,"mean":6.3649994636635,"rank":1531482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5708591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7252957,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321379,"mean":9.6362502100327,"rank":84452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":236041,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321379,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3768,"mean":5.7356968409875,"rank":1040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3768,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254,"mean":5.3616600790514,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":189,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
