Outline the variables present in patients with wounds taken into consideration when the MEAL tool was developed. 2. Identify the results of the MEAL tool pilot study.3. List implications from this study for wound care practice.\nTo construct a quickly and easily administered nutrition screening tool using variables believed to be predictive of malnutrition risk in the wound patient population.\nA prospective pilot study assessed patients on a list of suspected variables, as well as the Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), chosen as the criterion standard. Variables were analyzed to select the most appropriate items for inclusion on a new nutrition screening tool using preliminary bivariate correlations and \u03c7 tests of association. Items significantly associated with malnutrition were dichotomized, and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to arrive at a final model. A sum score was computed, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine designation of risk.\nAn outpatient wound center in Northeast Ohio.\nThe pilot study included a convenience sample of 105 outpatients with at least 1 active wound.\nMalnutrition as assessed by the Scored PG-SGA.\nThe final nutrition screening tool, the MEAL Scale, is composed of 4 dichotomous elements: multiple wounds (number of wounds), eats less than 3 meals per day, appetite decrease (eats less than usual), and level of activity. These variables predicted 83.7% of the malnutrition cases assessed by the Scored PG-SGA. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an acceptable area under the curve (0.8581), and a cutoff score of 2 or greater was selected to indicate risk (median sensitivity = 91.4%, median specificity = 60.9%).\nAlthough further studies of validity and reliability are necessary to establish the tool before widespread use, the MEAL Scale is a needed step toward nutrition screening in a wound patient population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056d4","authors":["Judith Fulton","Brad Evans","Stephannie Miller","Kimberly N.
