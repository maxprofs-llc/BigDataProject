However, studies are often carried out with small samples and without controlling for other variables. This study examined how different forms of identity-deaf, hearing, bicultural (deaf and hearing), and marginal (neither deaf nor hearing)-were associated with levels of psychological well-being and a number of other variables. The sample was 742 adults with hearing loss in Denmark. The study found that those with a deaf, hearing or bicultural identity had significantly higher levels of psychological well-being than those with a marginal identity. Further, it found that additional disability, educational level, and feeling discriminated against significantly and independently explained the degree of psychological well-being. Results are discussed here with respect to social identity theory and current deaf identity themes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a24","authors":["Chapman, Madeleine","Dammeyer, Jesper"],"doi":"10.1093\/deafed\/enw073","first_seen_on":"2016-11-28T10:40:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1081-4159","1465-7325"],"journal":"Journal of Deaf Studies & Deaf Education","last_mentioned_on":1481144976,"links":["http:\/\/jdsde.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/11\/22\/deafed.enw073.long","http:\/\/jdsde.oxfordjournals.org\/cgi\/content\/long\/enw073v1","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/deafed\/enw073"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jdsde.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/12\/01\/deafed.enw073.full.pdf","pmid":"27881482","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology","education"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significance-deaf-identity-psychological-wellbeing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":4,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":1649501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6151310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252614,"mean":12.191290012786,"rank":74850,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":177052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252614,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":400,"mean":4.0918796992481,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":400,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":6.26875,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
