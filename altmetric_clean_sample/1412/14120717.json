A neuroendocrine brain-placenta interaction has been described to explain the association between prenatal stress-related disorders and placental abnormalities. Whether these mechanisms may affect the likelihood of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of infections has never been investigated.\nTo evaluate the role of psychological factors in cytomegalovirus (CMV) MTCT in pregnant women with primary CMV infection.\nA cohort of 276 pregnant women with primary CMV infection underwent assessment of (a) reactive psychopathological symptoms, such as current depressive symptoms and ongoing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; and (b) stable personality traits, such as alexithymia and Type D (distressed) personality. Congenital infection was diagnosed by CMV DNA amplification from blood and\/or urine and saliva from newborn at birth.\nThe occurrence of congenital CMV disease in the newborn was independently predicted by post-traumatic stress symptoms during pregnancy.\nOur findings suggest that psychological stress-related disturbances may weaken the physical and immunological barrier against the mother-to-fetus transmission of viruses.\nWe declare that we have no conflicting interests to disclose.\n\u00a9 The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.
