The packing is centred on bis-(piperidinium) sulfate ribbons parallel to the c axis; the cations are hydrogen bonded to the sulfate by N-H\u22efO and C-H\u22efO inter-actions. The 1,3-di-methyl-urea mol-ecules are also hydrogen bonded to sulfate O atoms, and project outwards from the ribbon parallel to the b axis.","authors":["D\u00f6ring, C.","Lueck, J.F.D.","Jones, P.G.","D\u00f6ring, C.","Lueck, J.F.D.","Jones, P.G.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989017004820","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T00:00:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 5","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1491350406,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989017004820"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2017\/05\/00\/hg5484\/hg5484.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5418776","pmid":"28529768","pubdate":"2017-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structure of the 1:2 adduct of bis(piperidinium) sulfate and 1,3-dimethylthiourea","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-12-adduct-bispiperidinium-sulfate-13dimethylthiourea"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
