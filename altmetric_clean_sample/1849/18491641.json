Cross-species computational analyses were used to compare expression profiles for treated mice with those of patients who had received 5-ARIs before prostatectomy.\nFinasteride administered to Nkx3.1 mutant mice. 5-ARI-treated patient specimens obtained retrospectively.\nEndpoints in mice included histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular profiling. GraphPad Prism software, R-studio, and Matlab were used for statistical and data analyses.\nFinasteride treatment of Nkx3.1 mutant mice resulted in a significant reduction in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), as evident from histopathological and expression profiling analyses. Cross-species computational analysis comparing finasteride-treated mice with two independent 5-ARI-treated patient cohorts showed that reduced NKX3.1 expression is predictive of response to 5-ARI. A limitation of the study is that these retrospective human cohorts have relatively few patients with limited clinical outcome data. Future prospective clinical trials are needed to validate whether stratifying patients on the basis of NKX3.1 expression improves the benefit of 5-ARIs during active surveillance.\nThis co-clinical study implicates NKX3.1 status as a predictor of response to 5-ARIs, and suggests that molecular features, including NKX3.1 expression, may help to identify PCa patients most likely to benefit from 5-ARIs during active surveillance.\nThe aim of precision cancer prevention is to tailor interventions on the basis of individualized patient characteristics. We propose that patients with low NKX3.1 expression are optimal candidates for intervention with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors as an adjunct to active surveillance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002875","authors":["Aditya Dutta","Sukanya Panja","Renu K.
