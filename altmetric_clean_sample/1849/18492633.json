In a subgroup of 44 subjects, the lactose tolerance test was performed using both blood glucose and breath hydrogen determination. The remaining 370 probands were examined using a field version of the breath hydrogen test. In the total sample of 414 probands, 248 lactose malabsorbers were identified (60%). This result differs considerably from previous reports of very low frequencies of lactose malabsorption in Pakistan and neighbouring areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767b","authors":["Ahmad, M","Flatz, G"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T20:27:19+00:00","issns":["0001-5652"],"issue":"2","journal":"Human Heredity","last_mentioned_on":1491337624,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6745955"],"pmid":"6745955","pubdate":"1984-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Prevalence of primary adult lactose malabsorption in Pakistan.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-primary-adult-lactose-malabsorption-three-populations-northern-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":4520101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355981,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250798,"mean":13.08230063358,"rank":141014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":86672,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250798,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":3.1546611570248,"rank":164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
