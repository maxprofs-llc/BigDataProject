In this study, S. cerevisiae strains with different capacities to consume substrates present in wheat were selected to investigate the impact of substrate limitation on dough fermentation and final bread volume. Results show that fermentation of dough with maltose-negative strains relies on the presence of fructan and sucrose as fermentable substrates and can be used for regular bread making. Levels of fructan and sucrose, endogenously present or added, hence determine the extent of fermentation and timing at the proofing stage. Whole meal is inherently more suitable for substrate-limited fermentation than white flour, due to the presence of higher native levels of these substrates. Bread making protocols with long fermentation times are accommodated by addition of substrates like sucrose.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006625","authors":["Struyf, Nore","Laurent, Jitka","Verspreet, Joran","Verstrepen, Kevin J","Courtin, Christophe M.","Nore Struyf","Jitka Laurent","Joran Verspreet","Kevin J.
