Its rapid consumption of sugars and production of CO2 are the most important attributes required to leaven the dough. New research attempts highlight that these attributes are not unique to S. cerevisiae, but also found in several non-conventional yeast species. A small number of these yeast species with similar properties have been described, but remain poorly studied. They present a vast untapped potential for the use as leavening agents and flavor producers due to their genetic and phylogenetic diversity. We assessed the potential of several non-conventional yeasts as leavening agents and flavor producers in dough-like conditions in the presence of high sugar concentrations and stressful environments mimicking conditions found in flour dough. We tested the capabilities of bread leavening and aroma formation in a microbread platform as well as in a bakery setup. Bread leavened with Kazachstania gamospora and Wickerhamomyces subpelliculosus had better overall results compared to control baker's yeast. In addition, both displayed higher stress tolerance and broader aroma profiles than the control baker's yeast. These attributes are important in bread and other farinaceous products, making K. gamospora and W. subpelliculosus highly applicable as alternative baker's yeasts.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b4f","authors":["Nerve Zhou","Anna Judith Schifferdecker","Amparo Gamero","Concetta Compagno","Teun Boekhout","Jure Pi\u0161kur","Wolfgang Knecht"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.03.013","first_seen_on":"2017-04-05T00:04:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01681605","1879-3460"],"journal":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1491350653,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28365494?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28365494","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Kazachstania gamospora and Wickerhamomyces subpelliculosus : Two alternative baker\u2019s yeasts in the modern bakery","type":"article","volume":"250","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kazachstania-gamospora-wickerhamomyces-subpelliculosus-two-alternative-bakers-yeasts-modern-bakery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251371,"mean":13.074785630743,"rank":207815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251371,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1594,"mean":3.1449679849341,"rank":1195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1594,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":6.5111111111111,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
