It is essential to optimise health services to meet current needs and prepare for anticipated future demands. This paper explores issues impacting on people living with cognitive impairment and\/or dementia who experience a\u00a0hip fracture and are cared for in acute settings. This is important given the high mortality and morbidity associated with this population. Given the current insufficiency of clear evidence on optimum rehabilitation of this patient group, this paper explored three key themes namely: recognition of cognitive impairment, response by way of training and education of staff to optimise care for this patient group and review of the importance of outcomes measures. Whilst there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the optimal ways of caring for patients living with dementia following hip fracture, this paper concludes that future research should improve understanding of healthcare staff education to improve the outcomes for this important group of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d6a","authors":["Nigel Gill","Simon Hammond","Jane Cross","Toby Smith","Nigel Lambert","Chris Fox"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00391-017-1224-4","first_seen_on":"2017-04-04T21:49:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0948-6704","1435-1269"],"journal":"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Gerontologie und Geriatrie","last_mentioned_on":1491753185,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00391-017-1224-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00391-017-1224-4.pdf","pmid":"28364260","pubdate":"2017-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Medizin","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Aging","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"Optimising care for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia following hip fracture","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/optimising-care-patients-cognitive-impairment-dementia-following-hip-fracture"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.6,"score_history":{"1y":3.6,"6m":3.6,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":1836682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6179892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234943,"mean":12.917478833074,"rank":73090,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":161075,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234943,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":3.6314418604651,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.2,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":4,"IE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CamGeris\/statuses\/849378354167992320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18493503],"posted_on":"2017-04-04T21:49:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Cambridge Geriatrics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/836331298729914370\/AidIjCep_normal.jpg","description":"Educational account at the Department of Medicine for the Elderly at Addenbrooke's Hospital @CUH_NHS.
