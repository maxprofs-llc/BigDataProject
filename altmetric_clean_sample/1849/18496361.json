Half of them, including the HLA class I and II genes, are directly involved in immune responses. Consequently, the MHC strongly associates with numerous diseases and clinical therapies. Notoriously, the MHC has been intractable to high-throughput analysis at complete sequence resolution, and current reference haplotypes are inadequate for large-scale studies. To address these challenges, we developed a method that specifically captures and sequences the 4.8Mb MHC from genomic DNA. For 95 MHC homozygous cell lines we assembled, de novo, a set of high-fidelity contigs and a sequence scaffold, representing a mean 98% of the target region. Included are six alternative MHC reference sequences of the human genome that we completed and refined. Characterization of the sequence and structural diversity of all MHC genes, shows the approach accurately determines the sequences of the highly polymorphic HLA class I and HLA class II genes and the complex structural diversity of all genes, including complement factor C4. It has also uncovered extensive and unexpected diversity in other MHC genes, an example is MUC22, which encodes a lung mucin and exhibits more coding sequence alleles than any HLA class I or II gene studied here. More than 60% of the coding sequence alleles analyzed were previously uncharacterized. We have created a substantial database of robust reference MHC haplotype sequences that will enable future population scale studies of this complicated and clinically important region of the human genome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002944","authors":["Paul J Norman","Steven J Norberg","Lisbeth A Guethlein","Neda Nemat-Gorgani","Thomas E Royce","Emily E Wroblewski","Tobias Mann","Tamsen Dunn","Claudia Alicata","Jill A Hollenbach","Weihua Chang","Melissa Shults-Won","Kevin L Gunderson","Laurent Abi-Rached","Mostafa Ronaghi","Peter Parham","Paul J.
