Conversely, cattle (B. taurus) has been found to suffer from high-altitude hypertension or heart failure when exposed to these high altitudes. Two mitochondrial genes, MT-ND1 and MT-ND2, encode two subunits of NADH dehydrogenase play an essential role in the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We sequenced these two mitochondrial genes in two bovine groups (70 Tibetan yaks and 70 Xuanhan cattle) and downloaded 300 sequences of B. taurus (cattle), 93 sequences of B. grunniens (domestic yak), and 2 sequences of B. mutus (wild yak) from NCBI to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of adaptability to hypoxia at high altitudes in yaks compared to cattle. MT-ND1 SNP m.3907\u2009C\u2009>\u2009T, present in all Tibetan yaks, was positively associated with high-altitude adaptation (p\u2009<\u2009.0006). Specially, mutation m.3638\u2009A\u2009>\u2009G present in all cattle, resulting in the termination of transcription, was negatively associated with high-altitude adaptation (p\u2009<\u2009.0006). Additionally, MT-ND2 SNPs m.4351\u2009G\u2009>\u2009A and m.5218\u2009C\u2009>\u2009T also showed positive associations with high-altitude adaptation (p\u2009<\u2009.0004). MT-ND1 haplotypes H2, H3, H4, H6, and H7 showed positive associations but haplotype H20 had a negative association with high-altitude adaptation (p\u2009<\u2009.0008). Similarly, MT-ND2 haplotypes Ha1 Ha8, Ha10, and Ha11 were positively associated whereas haplotype Ha2 was negatively associated with adaptability to high-altitudes (p\u2009<\u2009.0008). Thus, MT-ND1 and MT-ND2 can be considered as candidate genes associated with adaptation to high-altitude environments.","altmetric_jid":"56dd9b6e2a83ee7d288b4576","authors":["Yu Shi","Yongsong Hu","Jie Wang","Mauricio A.
