There is a discrepancy between European regulatory approaches regarding the temperature at which degradation half-lives should be (1) measured in simulation degradation testing of environmental compartments, and (2) compared to the P\/vP criteria. In this paper, an opinion is provided on the options for the experimental temperature and extrapolation to other conditions. A review of the historical development of persistence criteria did not give conclusive evidence of the temperature at which the half-lives that underpin the P-criteria were measured, but room temperature is likely. Half-lives measured at 20\u00a0\u00b0C are in line with the intentions of some international agreements, but in the EU there is a continued political debate regarding the relevant temperature for comparison with persistence criteria. Measuring degradation at 20\u00a0\u00b0C has the advantage that metabolites\/transformation products can be identified with greater accuracy, and that kinetic fits to determine half-lives for parent compounds and metabolites carry less uncertainty. Extrapolation of half-lives to lower temperatures is possible for assessing environmental exposure, but the uncertainty of the persistence classification is smaller when measured half-lives are used for direct comparison with P\/vP criteria, without extrapolation. Model simulations demonstrate the pattern of concentrations that can be expected for realistic worst case climate scenarios in the EU based on the half-life of 120\u00a0days in soil at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and of 40\u00a0days in water at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, and their temporal and spatial variability.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000813","authors":["Michael Matthies","Sabine Beulke","Michael Matthies","Sabine Beulke"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12302-017-0113-1","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T08:21:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2190-4707","2190-4715"],"issue":"1","journal":"Environmental Sciences Europe","last_mentioned_on":1491553284,"links":["http:\/\/www.readcube.com\/articles\/10.1186%2Fs12302-017-0113-1?author_access_token=7wKMlZrO7AMXBPLrB0X22W_BpE1tBhCbnbw3BuzI2RMbmwvJUNZeLuz6z3y9M_kYeryXwSsd5hw4DCicbHfKGcJJBTH7wyes1iLMqQs9h_ZrtU-qhZNHU7zG1LiRr2SQNMVtvpW0mWyEZX3_86Obpg=="],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/enveurope.springeropen.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12302-017-0113-1?site=enveurope.springeropen.com","pmcid":"PMC5380697","pmid":"28424754","pubdate":"2017-04-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","title":"Considerations of temperature in the context of the persistence classification in the EU","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/considerations-temperature-context-persistence-classification-eu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":4206331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2233204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235176,"mean":12.877353179547,"rank":131732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235176,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":49.434310679612,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.51,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Enviresearch\/statuses\/850262216590770177","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18578032],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T08:21:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Enviresearch","url":"http:\/\/www.enviresearch.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/811216873316564992\/_nQ-PcY9_normal.jpg","description":"Enviresearch will provide the best regulatory and risk assessment service in Europe, for the global chemical industry.","id_on_source":"Enviresearch","tweeter_id":"788045310228652032","geo":{"lt":52.16045,"ln":-0.70312,"country":"GB"},"followers":73},"tweet_id":"850262216590770177"}]}}
