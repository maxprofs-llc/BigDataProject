These probed tooth-site level measures are usually rounded and recorded as whole numbers (in mm) producing clustered (site measures within a mouth) error-prone ordinal responses representing some ordering of the underlying PD progression. In addition, it is hypothesized that PD progression can be spatially-referenced, i.e., proximal tooth-sites share similar PD status in comparison to sites that are distantly located. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probit framework for these ordinal responses where the cut-point parameters linking the observed ordinal CAL levels to the latent underlying disease process can be fixed in advance. The latent spatial association characterizing conditional independence under Gaussian graphs is introduced via a nonparametric Bayesian approach motivated by the probit stick-breaking process, where the components of the stick-breaking weights follows a multivariate Gaussian density with the precision matrix distributed as G-Wishart. This yields a computationally simple, yet robust and flexible framework to capture the latent disease status leading to a natural clustering of tooth-sites and subjects with similar PD status (beyond spatial clustering), and improved parameter estimation through sharing of information. Both simulation studies and application to a motivating PD dataset reveal the advantages of considering this flexible nonparametric ordinal framework over other alternatives.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5643cf058f610004a2f","authors":["Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar","Canale, Antonio","Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","Antonio Canale"],"doi":"10.1111\/rssc.12150","endpage":"640","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T10:02:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1467-9876","0035-9254"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics)","last_mentioned_on":1468389491,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/rssc.12150\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/rssc.12150&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/rssc.12150#.V4S6odfjO1M.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/rssc.12150\/pdf","pmid":"27524839","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Decision Sciences","Social Sciences","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"startpage":"619","title":"Non-parametric spatial models for clustered ordered periodontal data","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonparametric-spatial-models-clustered-ordered-periodontal-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":3330946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4697577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271536,"mean":11.45771753181,"rank":100892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":168327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271536,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171,"mean":2.3784352941176,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.4,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Other":2,"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Computer Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tonycanale_\/statuses\/721994499757580288","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6777237],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T09:31:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Antonio Canale","url":"http:\/\/sites.carloalberto.org\/canale","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/588612722205458432\/w16lfaN9_normal.jpg","description":"Statistician and data scientist.
