This Letter shows a way of manipulating the mode coupling within an optical fiber by applying stress through an external 3D printed periodic structure. Different LPG lengths and periods have been studied, as well as the effect of the applied stress on the coupling efficiency from the fundamental mode to cladding modes. The technique is very simple, highly flexible, affordable, and easy to implement without the need of altering the optical fiber. This Letter is part of a growing line of interest in the use of 3D printers for optical applications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5773cf058f610004d26","authors":["Iezzi, Victor Lambin","Boisvert, Jean-S\u00e9bastien","Loranger, S\u00e9bastien","Kashyap, Raman"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T12:16:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-4794"],"issue":"8","journal":"Optics Letters","last_mentioned_on":1460981751,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27082365"],"pmid":"27082365","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Quantum Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"3D printed long period gratings for optical fibers.","type":"article","volume":"41"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":6552477,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267505,"mean":11.329867590765,"rank":224467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267505,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1015,"mean":7.0374792899408,"rank":780,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1015,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":17.589333333333,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NIHL3D\/statuses\/722035913992310784","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6779446],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T12:15:51+00:00","author":{"name":"NIHL 3D Printing","url":"http:\/\/nihlibrary.nih.gov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535844758770311168\/TEZkAxsL_normal.png","description":"National Institutes of Health Library","id_on_source":"NIHL3D","tweeter_id":"2887052859","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":735},"tweet_id":"722035913992310784"}]}}
