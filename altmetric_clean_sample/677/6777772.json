This method uses \u03b5PL's remarkable effect of promoting the enzymatic reaction of GOx with ferricyanide ion. This reaction reduces ferricyanide ion to ferrocyanide ion, accompanied by a color change from yellow to colorless. In this colorimetric assay, the detection limit of \u03b5PL was estimated to be approximately 0.5\u00a0mg\/L when purified \u03b5PL samples were used. \u03b5PL has usually been produced by a fermentation process using Streptomyces albulus species. The components of the culture broth showed interference effects against the assay method. However, due to the high sensitivity of the assay method for \u03b5PL, \u03b5PL could be detected in the culture broth without any pretreatment. The detectable concentration of \u03b5PL in the culture broth, cPL,ac, was estimated to be approximately 20\u00a0mg\/L. By combining the Berlin blue reaction with this method, the cPL,ac was reduced to 10\u00a0mg\/L. In light of the proposed method's simplicity and sensitivity, it could be useful for screening \u03b5PL synthetic enzymes and microorganisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd2","authors":["Uematsu, Kohei","Ueno, Takaaki","Ushimaru, Kazunori","Maruyama, Chitose","Hamano, Yoshimitsu","Katano, Hajime"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiosc.2016.03.005","first_seen_on":"2016-04-18T10:17:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-4421","13891723"],"journal":"Journal of Bioscience & Bioengineering","last_mentioned_on":1474689486,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27085788?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S1389172316300275&_version=1&md5=dbe49e1ca1d4a9948ead5eae5aa180c6"],"pmid":"27085788","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","microbiology"],"title":"Colorimetric method to detect \u03b5-poly-l-lysine using glucose oxidase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colorimetric-method-detect-%CE%B5polyllysine-using-glucose-oxidase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":6091234,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2032282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274097,"mean":11.543957664467,"rank":175192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":82692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274097,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":1.645332,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.66166666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/statuses\/722002891578343424","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6777772],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T10:04:38+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":328},"tweet_id":"722002891578343424"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/marinekk0907\/statuses\/779530323583393793","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6777772],"posted_on":"2016-09-24T03:58:06+00:00","author":{"name":"kk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/550770289\/3978698169_0493f030de_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"marinekk0907","tweeter_id":"90064711","geo":{"lt":36.25,"ln":138.98333,"country":"JP"},"followers":65},"tweet_id":"779530323583393793"}]}}
