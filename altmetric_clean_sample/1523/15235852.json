However, the environmental impacts of the resulting filtrate (brine) discharged to surface water need to be evaluated before large-scale desalination can be successful in the United States. Developing fish are especially sensitive to changes in salinity and varying ionic composition. Limited research is available on the impacts of hypersalinity on chronic vertebrate embryonic development, particularly on sublethal effects. To investigate this, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos were treated with: (1) graphite filtered freshwater; (2) artificial seawater [17, 35, 42, 56, and 70\u00a0parts per thousand (ppt)]; (3) effluent from a desalination facility at Monterey Bay Aquarium, CA, diluted to 75, 50, and 25% with 35\u00a0ppt artificial seawater to simulate mixing (39, 42, 46, and 50\u00a0ppt); (4) artificial San Joaquin River water (CA, USA) (9, 13, and 17\u00a0ppt); and (5) artificial San Joaquin River water diluted to 75, 50, and 25% with artificial seawater to simulate estuarine mixing in the San Francisco Bay (13, 19, 24, and 30\u00a0ppt). Percent hatch, survival post hatch, deformities, swim bladder inflation, and median day to hatch were recorded to calculate EC50 (50% effect concentration) and NOEC (no observable effect concentration) values. No significant difference was observed between artificial seawater and Monterey Bay aquarium effluent (EC50\u00a0=\u00a045-55\u00a0ppt). However, San Joaquin River water decreased survival post hatch and increased deformities in comparison to artificial seawater and San Joaquin River water mixed with seawater, suggesting that unique ion compositions may play a role in embryo and larval toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000649d","authors":["Allison Kupsco","Rafid Sikder","Daniel Schlenk"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00244-016-0354-9","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T23:03:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0703"],"journal":"Archives of Environmental Contamination & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1483570982,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs00244-016-0354-9"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00244-016-0354-9.pdf","pmid":"28054105","pubdate":"2017-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Comparative Developmental Toxicity of Desalination Brine and Sulfate-Dominated Saltwater in a Euryhaline Fish","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-developmental-toxicity-desalination-brine-sulfatedominated-saltwater-euryhaline-fish"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":6905267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253621,"mean":12.598349183818,"rank":208946,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253621,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1091,"mean":3.9610532110092,"rank":896,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1091,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.5457142857143,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
