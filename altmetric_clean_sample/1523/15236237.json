Patients completed a 6-min walk test (6MWT) on POD6. Step count and physical activity intensity (METs; metbolic equivalents) were the main outcome measures.\nMales exhibited significantly higher physiotherapist-supervised and independent physical activity step counts and time \u2265\u20093 METS (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). The 6MWT distance on POD6 was greater in men (mean 393 m, standard deviation (SD) 108 m) than women (mean 300 m, SD 121 m) (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Mean length of stay in hospital was 9 days (SD 3 days) and was negatively correlated with overall physiotherapist-supervised (R\u2009=\u2009-0.70), independent physical activity step counts (R\u2009=\u2009-0.62), and combined physiotherapist-supervised (R\u2009=\u2009-0.65) and independent (R\u2009=\u2009-0.43) physical activity time \u2265\u20093 METs.\nPhysiotherapist-supervised activity fosters improvements in postoperative physiological functional capacity and reduces length of stay in hospital following cardiac surgery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040c6","authors":["S Mungovan","P Singh","G Gass","N Smart","A Hirschhorn"],"doi":"10.2340\/16501977-2165","first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T23:58:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1650-1977","1651-2081"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1502610390,"links":["https:\/\/www.medicaljournals.se\/jrm\/content\/abstract\/10.2340\/16501977-2165?ref=search"],"pmid":"28101566","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"Effect of physical activity in the first five days after cardiac surgery","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-physical-activity-first-five-days-after-cardiac-surgery-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":5.2,"6m":0.85,"3m":0.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":1584047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6774549,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275706,"mean":12.356533816942,"rank":71053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":204228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275706,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":469,"mean":3.1667478632479,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":404,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":469,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.1129032258065,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
