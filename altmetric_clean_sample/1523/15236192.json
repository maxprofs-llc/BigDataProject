Weights and heights were measured at the tri-monthly treatment visits for a period of one year. Among the 273 children who were seen and weighed at the one-year follow-up visit, the rate of weight gain was 8 per cent greater for those receiving levamisole than for placebo-treated controls (p = .06). In 78 children known to be infected with Ascaris at baseline, the rate of weight gain was 21 per cent greater in children treated with levamisole than in those receiving placebo (p = .03). The rate of height gain was no different for treatment and placebo groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["W C Willett","W L Kilama","C M Kihamia"],"first_seen_on":"2017-01-04T23:50:39+00:00","issns":["0090-0036"],"issue":"10","journal":"American Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1483558620,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1619153\/pdf\/amjph00695-0015.pdf"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1619153\/pdf\/amjph00695-0015.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1619153","pmid":"384815","pubdate":"1979-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Public Health Association","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"987","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Ascaris and growth rates: a randomized trial of treatment.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ascaris-growth-rates-randomized-trial-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":9,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7981790,"mean":6.7349664530035,"rank":884007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7054179,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7981790,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253622,"mean":12.598314887174,"rank":44318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":208909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253622,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8549,"mean":14.671181328966,"rank":1984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8549,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":43.866427480916,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
