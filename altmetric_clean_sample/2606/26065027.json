The mechanisms is based on the manipulation of the surface plasmon band of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) via the formation of Ag (NH3)2(+) complex. This complex decreases the amount of AgNPs in the solution and consequently, the color intensity of the colloidal system decreases. Not only the variation in color intensity of the solution can be tracked by a UV-vis spectrophotometer, but also a smartphone can be employed to monitor the color intensity variation by RGB analysis. Ammonia, in the concentration range of 10-1000mgL(-1), was successfully measured spectrophotometrically (UV-vis spectrophotometer) and colorimetrically (RGB measurement) with the detection limit of 180 and 200mgL(-1), respectively. Linear relationships were also developed for both methods. Also, the response time of the developed colorimetric sensor was around 20s. Both of the colorimetric and spectrophotometric methods showed a reliable performance for determination of ammonia in the real samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003609","authors":["Amirmostafa Amirjani","Davoud Haghshenas Fatmehsari"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.talanta.2017.08.022","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T10:01:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00399140","1873-3573"],"journal":"Talanta","last_mentioned_on":1505728855,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28917747?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28917747","pubdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Colorimetric detection of ammonia using smartphones based on localized surface plasmon resonance of silver nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"176","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/colorimetric-detection-ammonia-using-smartphones-based-localized-surface-plasmon-resonance-silver-na"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110642,"mean":11.83069800526,"rank":90267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110642,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1614,"mean":1.5377433353999,"rank":1280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1614,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.69404761904762,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
