Need further reseach.","Evidence on persistence with anticoagulants, its effect on the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism #VTE"],"citation":{"abstract":"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence is high following an initial VTE event, and it persists over time. This recurrence risk decreases rapidly after starting with anticoagulation treatment and reduces by ~80%-90% with prolonged anticoagulation. Nonpersistence with anticoagulants could lead to increased risk of VTE recurrence. This systematic review aimed to estimate persistence at 3, 6, and 12 months with anticoagulants in patients with VTE, and to evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence in nonpersistent patients.\nPubMed and Embase(\u00ae) were searched up to May 3, 2014 and the search results updated to May 31, 2015. Studies involving patients with VTE aged \u226518 years, treatment with anticoagulants intended for at least 3 months or more, and reporting data for persistence were included. Proportions were transformed using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and pooled using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects approach.\nIn total, 12 observational studies (7\/12 conference abstracts) were included in the review. All 12 studies either reported or provided data for persistence. The total number of patients meta-analyzed to estimate persistence at 3, 6, and 12 months was 71,969 patients, 58,940 patients, and 68,235 patients, respectively. The estimated persistence for 3, 6, and 12 months of therapy was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-87; I (2)=99.3%), 62% (95% CI, 58-66; I (2)=98.1%), and 31% (95% CI, 22-40; I (2)=99.8%), respectively. Only two studies reported the risk of VTE recurrence based on nonpersistence - one at 3 months and the other at 12 months.\nLimited evidence showed that persistence was suboptimal with an estimated 17% patients being nonpersistent with anticoagulants in the crucial first 3 months. Persistence declined over 6 and 12 months. Observational data on persistence with anticoagulation treatment, especially direct oral anticoagulants, in patients with VTE and its effect on risk of VTE recurrence were scarce and further research is required.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc71","authors":["Pareen Vora","Montse Soriano-Gabarro","Kiliana Suzart-Woischnik","Gunnar Brobert","Montse Soriano-Gabarr\u00f3","Kiliana Suzart","Gunnar Persson Brobert"],"doi":"10.2147\/ppa.s112297","endpage":"1665","first_seen_on":"2016-09-04T06:14:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1177-889X"],"journal":"Patient preference and adherence","last_mentioned_on":1474463409,"links":["https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/limited-evidence-on-persistence-with-anticoagulants-and-its-effect-on--peer-reviewed-article-PPA","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5010154\/?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=32140","pmid":"27621599","pubdate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1657","title":"Limited evidence on persistence with anticoagulants, and its effect on the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review of observational studies","type":"article","volume":"Volume 10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/limited-evidence-persistence-anticoagulants-effect-risk-recurrence-venous-thromboembolism-systematic-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8414405,"mean":7.0824487780638,"rank":3658552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4635112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8414405,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252624,"mean":12.495910601964,"rank":103809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":144414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252624,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":814,"mean":4.4843911439114,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":814,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":6.0421917808219,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ZA":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HannelieMeyer\/statuses\/772316823022739457","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11717858],"posted_on":"2016-09-04T06:14:14+00:00","author":{"name":"Hannelie Meyer","url":"http:\/\/savic.ac.za","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/795283740666773504\/_wL0hi5J_normal.jpg","description":"Passionate about Public Health Pharmacy in SA * Course leader MPharm @SMU_PHPM * Vaccination saves lives @SAVICinfo * All tweets my own opinion","id_on_source":"HannelieMeyer","tweeter_id":"188081075","geo":{"lt":-29,"ln":24,"country":"ZA"},"followers":679},"tweet_id":"772316823022739457"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NSchellack\/statuses\/772335164152217600","license":"gnip","rt":["HannelieMeyer"],"citation_ids":[11717858],"posted_on":"2016-09-04T07:27:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Natalie Schellack","url":"http:\/\/www.sasocp.co.za","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/889807096736362496\/l3t3rU0L_normal.jpg","description":"Committed to clinical pharmacy and paediatrics in South Africa.Course leader of the postgraduate degree in clinical pharmacy at SMU.
