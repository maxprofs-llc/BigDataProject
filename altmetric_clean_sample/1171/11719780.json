During the past decade, several new parvoviruses have been discovered in pigs. Porcine parvovirus type 6 (PPV6), recently identified, has been reported in pigs in China and in the USA while the PPV6 status in the European pig population remains undetermined. In the present study, PPV6 DNA was identified in serum samples collected from domestic pigs in Poland. In investigated herds, the prevalence of PPV6 was 14.9\u00a0% (15\/101 samples). Sequencing was conducted, and 11 nearly complete PPV6 genomes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PPV6 sequences cluster into four distinct groups, and the Polish PPV6 strains from three individual farms were present in three of these four groups. In addition, the Polish PPV6 strain P15-1 was identified as a putative recombination of an ORF1 from US stains and an ORF2 from Chinese strains. This is the first identification of PPV6 in Europe, and this finding will encourage future epidemiological studies on parvoviruses in European pigs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008c88","authors":["Cui, Jin","Fan, Jinghui","Gerber, Priscilla F","Biernacka, Kinga","Stadejek, Tomasz","Xiao, Chao-Ting","Opriessnig, Tanja","Priscilla Freitas Gerber","Biernacka , Kinga","Tanja Opriessnig","Jin Cui","Jinghui Fan","Priscilla F.
