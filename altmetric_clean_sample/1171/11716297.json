PBDEs have been shown to accumulate in the environment and human populations while exhibiting a range of toxic effects. In this study, surface soil samples from 30 sites in the city of Melbourne, Australia, were analysed for PBDEs. Eight congeners of environmental concern (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154 -183 and -209) were assessed using selective pressurized liquid extraction (S-PLE) and gas chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS\/MS). PBDEs were detected in 29\/30 samples with \u03a38PBDE soil concentrations ranging nd-13,200\u00a0ng\/g dw and \u03a37PBDEs (excluding BDE-209) levels of nd-70.5\u00a0ng\/g dw. Soils from waste disposal sites (n\u00a0=\u00a06) contained the highest median \u03a37PBDE and \u03a38PBDE concentrations, followed by manufacturing sites (n\u00a0=\u00a018) and then non-source sites (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Electronics recycling facilities contained the greatest levels of \u03a38PBDEs by a significant margin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) to indicate that these industries are a potential source of contamination. BDE-209 was the dominant congener, contributing an average of 75.5% to \u03a38PBDEs soil concentrations, followed by BDE-47, BDE-99 and BDE-183\u00a0at 7.90, 5.64 and 4.31%, respectively. Congener profiles reflected global estimates of Deca-BDE, Octa-BDE and Penta- BDE commercial production, with the most significant congener correlation existing between BDE-47 and BDE-99 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.943). This first assessment of PBDEs in Melbourne soils indicates widespread contamination of the urban environment, including locations where direct sources to soil are not clear.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f7","authors":["McGrath, Thomas J","Morrison, Paul D","Sandiford, Christopher J","Ball, Andrew S","Clarke, Bradley O"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chemosphere.2016.08.017","endpage":"232","first_seen_on":"2016-09-04T01:35:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1298","00456535"],"journal":"Chemosphere","last_mentioned_on":1472952886,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27588576"],"pmid":"27588576","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"225","subjects":["chemistry","biology","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Widespread polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) contamination of urban soils in Melbourne, Australia","type":"article","volume":"164","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/widespread-polybrominated-diphenyl-ether-pbde-contamination-urban-soils-melbourne-australia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8324953,"mean":7.0165383958894,"rank":7198038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8324953,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251852,"mean":12.458098947393,"rank":210742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251852,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3842,"mean":3.4280244727935,"rank":3364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3842,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":3.0669622641509,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
