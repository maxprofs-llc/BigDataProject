Mortality was monitored for up to ten years. The relationship found between hypertension and mortality is characterized in this report by four parameters: attributable risk, prevalence, population attributable risk, and population attributable fraction. Attributable risk of death, a measure of the over-all impact of hypertension on those in each race-sex group with hypertension, is high in white males, black males, and black females, and is lowest in white females. Population attributable risk, a measure of the impact of hypertension on each entire race-sex group, is highest in black males and females due to the high prevalence of hypertension in blacks. It is somewhat lower in white males and lowest in white females. The fraction of all deaths attributable to hypertension (population attributable fraction) is highest in black females and lower in the other three groups. The population attributable fraction (ranging from 0.26 to 0.54 for systolic hypertension) is of such magnitude that if the 50% reduction in mortality achieved in the Veteran Administration Cooperative Study could be repeated in the general population, life expectancy after 40 years of age could be substantially increased.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["D C Deubner","H A Tyroler","J C Cassel","C G Hames","C Becker"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.cir.52.5.901","endpage":"908","first_seen_on":"2016-12-24T08:08:26+00:00","issns":["0009-7322","1524-4539"],"issue":"5","journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":883612800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1161\/01.CIR.52.5.901"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/circulationaha\/52\/5\/901.full.pdf","pmid":"1175273","pubdate":"1975-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"901","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Attributable risk, population attributable risk, and population attributable fraction of death associated with hypertension in a biracial population","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attributable-risk-population-attributable-risk-population-attributable-fraction-death-associated-hyp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6843909,"mean":6.1865045436003,"rank":1593508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":4509959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6843909,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95223,"mean":11.146340803596,"rank":28390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":65479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95223,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7581,"mean":14.487379419525,"rank":3284,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":3437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7581,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":31.891711111111,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Control of Cardiovascular Diseases in Developing Countries: Research, Development, and Institutional Strengthening","url":"https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/download\/6218","license":"public","citation_ids":[9891526,173695,1952422,3173495,14978253,16598459,3549932,15007261,14579117,15007263,15007268,1587343,15007273,15007274,967243,2204740,16707425,15007276,3641585,15007279,1487334,203424,15007284,15007288,15007292,15007293,15007294,6289153,15007299,15007300,6302741,15007301,15007303,15007304,15007305,15007307,15007308,17246239,15007310],"posted_on":"1998-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"National Academies Press","description":"The US National Academies Press (NAP) was created by the National Academy of Sciences to publish the reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, operating under a charter granted by the Congress of the United States.
