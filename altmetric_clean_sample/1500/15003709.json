Insect wing deformations during flight are largely passive, and are controlled primarily by the architecture and material properties of the wing. Although many details of wing structure are well understood, the distribution of flexural stiffness in insect wings and its effects on wing bending are unknown. In this study, we developed a method of estimating spatial variation in flexural stiffness in both the spanwise and chordwise direction of insect wings. We measured displacement along the wing in response to a point force, and modeled flexural stiffness variation as a simple mathematical function capable of approximating this measured displacement. We used this method to estimate flexural stiffness variation in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, and the dragonfly Aeshna multicolor. In both species, flexural stiffness declines sharply from the wing base to the tip, and from the leading edge to the trailing edge; this variation can be approximated by an exponential decline. The wings of M. sexta also display dorsal\/ventral asymmetry in flexural stiffness and significant differences between males and females. Finite element models based on M. sexta forewings demonstrate that the measured spatial variation in flexural stiffness preserves rigidity in proximal regions of the wing, while transferring bending to the edges, where aerodynamic force production is most sensitive to subtle changes in shape.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f43cf058f610002d97","authors":["S.
