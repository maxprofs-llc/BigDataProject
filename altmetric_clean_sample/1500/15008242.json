Changes in hemostatic factors 5 hours after infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) revealed a more profound fall in fibrinogen levels in black patients compared with the response seen in Hispanic or white patients (mean change in fibrinogen +\/- SD, mg\/dL: 151.3 +\/- 107.4, 112.2 +\/- 97.0, 109.4 +\/- 98.6; P < .001, respectively) without more frequent infarct-related artery patency or hemorrhagic complications. Mortality was similar in the white, black, and Hispanic patients through the first year after adjustment for baseline variables.\nTIMI II data yield evidence that (1) corroborates published reports of a high prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors among minority patients with acute myocardial infarction, (2) there is a greater decrease in fibrinogen levels 5 hours after the start of rt-PA infusion among black patients than in white and Hispanic patients without evidence of more frequent infarct-related artery patency or hemorrhagic complications, and (3) thrombolytic therapy with appropriate supplemental measures is associated with comparable 1-year mortality in white, black, and Hispanic patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057f2","authors":["H A Taylor","B R Chaitman","W J Rogers","M J Kern","M L Terrin","F V Aguirre","G Sopko","R McMahon","R N Ross","E C Bovill"],"doi":"10.1161\/01.cir.88.4.1484","endpage":"1494","first_seen_on":"2016-12-24T08:16:30+00:00","issns":["0009-7322","1524-4539"],"issue":"4 Pt 1","journal":"Circulation","last_mentioned_on":852076800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1161\/01.CIR.88.4.1484"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/circulationaha\/88\/4\/1484.full.pdf","pmid":"8403296","pubdate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Heart Association, Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1484","subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Race and prognosis after myocardial infarction.
