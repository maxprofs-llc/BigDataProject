Even so, it remains open whether direct inhibition of eEF2K without altering up-stream or other signaling pathways affects hippocampal synaptic transmission and neuronal network synchrony. Inhibition of eEF2K by the selective and potent eEF2K inhibitor A-484954 induced a fast pre-synaptically mediated enhancement of synaptic transmission and synchronization of neural network activity. The eEF2K-inhibition mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 neurons is most notably independent of protein synthesis and does not rely on protein kinase C, protein kinase A or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1\/2. Moreover, the strengthening of synaptic transmission in the response to the inhibition of eEF2K was strongly attenuated by the inhibition of p38 MAPK. In addition, we show the involvement of barium-sensitive and more specific the TWIK-related potassium-1 (TREK-1) channels in the eEF2K-inhibition mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission. These findings reveal a novel pathway of eEF2K mediated regulation of hippocampal synaptic transmission. Further research is required to study whether such compounds could be beneficial for the development of mood disorder treatments with a fast-acting antidepressant response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0a","authors":["Weng, Weiguang","Chen, Ying","Wang, Man","Zhuang, Yinghan","Behnisch, Thomas"],"doi":"10.3389\/fncel.2016.00247","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T09:42:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5102"],"journal":"Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1477388521,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncel.2016.00247\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncel.2016.00247\/pdf","pmid":"27826228","pubdate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Potentiation of Schaffer-Collateral CA1 Synaptic Transmission by eEF2K and p38 MAPK Mediated Mechanisms","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potentiation-schaffercollateral-ca1-synaptic-transmission-eef2k-p38-mapk-mediated-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":6572943,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235116,"mean":12.669141271293,"rank":191643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235116,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1328,"mean":3.9236367746797,"rank":1105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1328,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":2.2559701492537,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
