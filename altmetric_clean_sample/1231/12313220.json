The exercise-induced oxidative skeletal muscle adaptation in COPD patients with inherited alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) has not been studied.\nTo compare PR effects on skeletal muscle adaptation in COPD patients with and without A1ATD.\nNine COPD patients with A1ATD (genotype PiZZ, 6 receiving A1AT augmentation therapy), and 10 'usual' COPD patients (genotype PiMM) performed an incremental cycling test and underwent musculus vastus lateralis biopsies before and after a 3-week PR program including exercise training.\nPiZZ and PiMM patients improved peak work rate following PR (+9 \u00b1 11 W, p < 0.05, and +18 \u00b1 9 W, p < 0.001, between-group difference p < 0.05). PiMM patients increased fibre type I (+8.1%), reduced fibre type IIA (-2.1%) and hybrid fibre type IIA\/IIX proportion (-3.9%). Following PR, PiMM patients also raised mitochondrial signalling proteins PGC-1\u03b1 (4.5-fold), and TFAM (6.4-fold). PiZZ patients had no change in fibre type I but showed a shift of type IIA\/IIX (-8.8%) towards fibre type IIA distribution (+8.9%). The capillary to fibre ratio increased by 28% (p < 0.05) in PiZZ, whereas no change was observed in PiMM patients. Linear regression analysis revealed that diffusion capacity and A1AT therapy are predictor variables for myofibre type I response to PR (r2 = 0.684, p < 0.01).\nFollowing a 3-week PR with comparable training modalities, PiMM but not PiZZ patients increased the oxidative myofibre type I proportion. This skeletal muscle adaptation pattern suggests better improvement of exercise capacity in PiMM than in PiZZ patients with COPD.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003470","authors":["Jarosch, Inga","Gehlert, Sebastian","Jacko, Daniel","Koczulla, Rembert Andreas","Wencker, Marion","Welte, Tobias","Bloch, Wilhelm","Janciauskiene, Sabina","Kenn, Klaus"],"doi":"10.1159\/000449509","first_seen_on":"2016-09-30T12:52:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1423-0356","0025-7931"],"issue":"5","journal":"Respiration","last_mentioned_on":1476703779,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27686000","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27686000\/"],"pmid":"27686000","pubdate":"2016-09-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Different Training-Induced Skeletal Muscle Adaptations in COPD Patients with and without Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-traininginduced-skeletal-muscle-adaptations-copd-patients-without-alpha1-antitrypsin-defic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":3149560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4295883,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241199,"mean":12.491486778497,"rank":99363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":137607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241199,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":2.3472938596491,"rank":195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.8472222222222,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Neuroscience":2,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Inspire4lifeorg\/statuses\/783547411302117377","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12313220],"posted_on":"2016-10-05T06:00:35+00:00","author":{"name":"elaine bevan-smith","url":"https:\/\/www.walkingforhealth.org.uk\/walkfinder\/inspire-4-lifehttpshttps","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/739852350588866561\/axdankHP_normal.jpg","description":"Advanced nurse practitioner COPD\/pulm rehab.
