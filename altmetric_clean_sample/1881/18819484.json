However, the probable effects and underlying mechanisms of PFN2 in tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) of non-small cell lung cancer\u00a0(NSCLC) remain poorly understood. The protein and mRNA levels of PFN2 in human bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE and three NSCLC cell lines A549, NCI-H520 and 95D were assessed. The gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss\u2011of-function (siRNA) experiments of PFN2 were performed in 95D\u00a0cells. A dual-luciferase reporter assay, western blotting and real-time PCR were used to investigate the relationship between PFN2 and miR\u201130a\u20115p. PFN2 was upregulated in three NSCLC cell lines, and the highest in 95D\u00a0cell line. Furthermore, the upregulation of PFN2 promoted, whereas the downregulation of PFN2 suppressed invasion and EMT in 95D. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR\u201130a\u20115p directly interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PFN2 mRNA. Interestingly, miR\u201130a\u20115p negatively regulates the expression of PFN2 and suppresses EMT and invasion in 95D. In summary, the present study demonstrated that miR\u201130a\u20115p inhibits EMT and invasion in high invasive NSCLC cell lines via targeting PFN2. Suggesting the association of miR\u201130a\u20115p and PFN2 may play an essential role in the development of NSCLC by modulating EMT and cell invasion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Yan, Jiliang","Ma, Chunyan","Gao, Yue"],"doi":"10.3892\/or.2017.5566","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T18:03:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1021-335X","1791-2431"],"issue":"5","journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1492193015,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28405690?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28405690","pubdate":"2017-04-14T22:05:12+00:00","publisher":"Spandidos Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MicroRNA-30a-5p suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting profilin-2 in high invasive non-small cell lung cancer cell lines","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":6989751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237116,"mean":12.839868924361,"rank":193614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237116,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1593,"mean":1.6704020100503,"rank":966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1593,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":0.45379746835443,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/852945444632018944","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18819484],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T18:03:35+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
