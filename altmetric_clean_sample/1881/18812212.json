A total of nine patients with stage I, left-sided breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were selected for this retrospective study. For each patient, a hybrid arc plan was generated and then compared with two hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. All plans were optimized using the same objectives and dose constraints. The prescription dose was 50.4 Gy to the planning target volume with simultaneous boost to 60 Gy to the expanded gross target volume in 28 fractions. The differences among these hybrid plans were analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The hybrid arc plans achieved the clinical requirements of target dose coverage and normal tissue (NT) dose constraints. It was found that the hybrid arc plans showed advantages in the conformity index of the expanded gross target volume, the V5 of the heart, the D2 of the left ventricle, and the D2 and V50.4 of NTs. The average beam-on time and monitor units of the hybrid arc plans were significantly lower (P < 0.001).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f61000404d","authors":["Xu, Ben-Hua","Chen, Yuan-Gui","Li, An-Chuan","Li, Wen-Yao","Huang, Miao-Yun","Li, Xiao-Bo","Chen, Ming-Qiu","Zhang, Mutian"],"doi":"10.4103\/jmp.jmp_105_16","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T10:06:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0971-6203"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Medical Physics","last_mentioned_on":1492164369,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28405101?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC5370332","pmid":"28405101","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The feasibility study of a hybrid coplanar arc technique versus hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy in treatment of early-stage left-sided breast cancer with simultaneous-integrated boost","type":"article","volume":"42"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":6989761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237117,"mean":12.839928220786,"rank":193628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237117,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.1142857142857,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/852825295878995968","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18812212],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T10:06:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"852825295878995968"}]}}
