Among patients who sustained high-energy injuries, in-hospital mortality was 8%, 1-year mortality was 15%, and 5-year mortality was 25%. Among patients who sustained low-energy injuries, in-hospital mortality was 3%, 1-year mortality was 23%, and 5-year mortality was 40%. Low-energy mechanism of injury was an independent predictor for 1- and 5-year mortality, even when controlling for Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Injury Severity Score (ISS), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score.\nGeriatric patients with high-energy injuries and those with low-energy injuries seem to represent different patient populations, and low-energy mechanism seems to be a marker for frailty. High-energy mechanism was associated with lower long-term mortality rates, even when controlling for CCI, ISS, age, sex, BMI, and admission GCS score.\nPrognostic Level III.
