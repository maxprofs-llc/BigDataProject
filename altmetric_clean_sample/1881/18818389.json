What's Cochrane say about Mg2+ oh well"],"citation":{"abstract":"Oral magnesium supplementation is commonly used to support a low magnesium diet. This investigation set out to determine whether magnesium in a cream could be absorbed transdermally in humans to improve magnesium status.\nIn this single blind, parallel designed pilot study, n = 25 participants (aged 34.3+\/-14.8y, height 171.5+\/-11cm, weight 75.9 +\/-14 Kg) were randomly assigned to either a 56mg\/day magnesium cream or placebo cream group for two weeks. Magnesium serum and 24hour urinary excretion were measured at baseline and at 14 days intervention. Food diaries were recorded for 8 days during this period. Mg test and placebo groups' serum and urinary Mg did not differ at baseline. After the Mg2+ cream intervention there was a clinically relevant increase in serum magnesium (0.82 to 0.89 mmol\/l,p = 0.29) that was not seen in the placebo group (0.77 to 0.79 mmol\/L), but was only statistically significant (p = 0.02)) in a subgroup of non-athletes. Magnesium urinary excretion increased from baseline slightly in the Mg2+ group but with no statistical significance (p = 0.48). The Mg2+ group showed an 8.54% increase in serum Mg2+ and a 9.1% increase in urinary Mg2+ while these figures for the placebo group were smaller, i.e. +2.6% for serum Mg2+ and -32% for urinary Mg2+. In the placebo group, both serum and urine concentrations showed no statistically significant change after the application of the placebo cream.\nNo previous studies have looked at transdermal absorbency of Mg2+ in human subjects. In this pilot study, transdermal delivery of 56 mg Mg\/day (a low dose compared with commercial transdermal Mg2+ products available) showed a larger percentage rise in both serum and urinary markers from pre to post intervention compared with subjects using the placebo cream, but statistical significance was achieved only for serum Mg2+ in a subgroup of non-athletes. Future studies should look at higher dosage of magnesium cream for longer durations.\nISRCTN registry ID No. ISRTN15136969.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kass, Lindsy","Rosanoff, Andrea","Tanner, Amy","Sullivan, Keith","McAuley, William","Plesset, Michael","Lindsy Kass","Andrea Rosanoff","Amy Tanner","Keith Sullivan","William McAuley","Michael Plesset"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0174817","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T17:07:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1506186939,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28403154","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174817","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0174817","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0174817"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174817&type=printable","pmid":"28403154","pubdate":"2017-04-14T22:11:04+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Effect of transdermal magnesium cream on serum and urinary magnesium levels in humans: A pilot study.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-transdermal-magnesium-cream-serum-urinary-magnesium-levels-humans-pilot-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.6,"score_history":{"1y":16.6,"6m":16.6,"3m":4.1,"1m":4.1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":536241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7917050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252120,"mean":12.972538705928,"rank":27645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":224425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252120,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116447,"mean":10.678997423699,"rank":11607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":104817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116447,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4567,"mean":10.22152869032,"rank":438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4567,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Effect of transdermal magnesium cream on serum and urinary magnesium levels in humans: A pilot study (2017)","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FoodNerds\/comments\/65c6ts\/effect_of_transdermal_magnesium_cream_on_serum\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18818389],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T12:19:18+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"shrillthrill"}},{"title":"Effect of transdermal magnesium cream on serum and urinary magnesium levels in humans: A pilot study [PLoS ONE, 12 Apr 2017 \u2014 free full-text]","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pharmacology\/comments\/688vbv\/effect_of_transdermal_magnesium_cream_on_serum\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18818389],"posted_on":"2017-04-29T11:26:54+00:00","author":{"name":"isosafrole","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/pharmacology","id_on_source":"pharmacology","followers":1513,"subreddit":"pharmacology"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Lindsy_sport\/statuses\/853746351494049792","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18818389],"posted_on":"2017-04-16T23:06:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Lindsy","url":"http:\/\/scholar.google.co.uk\/citations?user=zSvwWBAAAAAJ&hl=en","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781582435406475264\/65SP_P3b_normal.jpg","description":"Sport and Exercise Scientist.
