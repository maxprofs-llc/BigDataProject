We aimed to characterize and compare patients with aggressive lymphoma by objective response and survival status based on pre-treatment cancer-specific geriatric (C-SGA) and quality of life (QoL) assessments.\nPatients not eligible for anthracycline-based first-line therapy or intensive salvage regimens completed C-SGA and QoL assessment before and after a rituximab-bendamustine-lenalidomide (R-BL) treatment in a phase II clinical trial. Clinical outcomes were compared based on pre-treatment individual and summary C-SGA measures, their cutoff-based subcategories and QoL indicators, using Wilcoxon rank sum or chi-square tests.\nA total of 57 patients (41 included in the clinical trial) completed a C-SGA. Participants with pre-treatment impaired functional status (Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 score \u22653) were more likely to experience worse outcomes: a higher proportion were non-responders, died before the median follow-up of 31.6\u00a0months (interquartile range (IQR) 27.9-37.9) or died during treatment. Non-responders were patients categorized as having possible depression (Geriatric Depression Scale-5 score \u22652) and with worse QoL scores for functional performance. Patients with worse C-SGA summary scores and with greater tiredness were more likely to die during treatment.\nA pre-treatment impaired functional status is an important factor with respect to clinical outcomes in patients receiving an R-BL regimen. Individual geriatric and related QoL domains showed similar associations with clinical outcomes. Whether interventions targeting specific geriatric dimensions also translate in better symptom- or domain-specific QoL warrants further research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035ed","authors":["Ribi, Karin","Rondeau, St\u00e9phanie","Hitz, Felicitas","Mey, Ulrich","Enoiu, Milica","Pabst, Thomas","Stathis, Anastasios","Fischer, Natalie","Clough-Gorr, Kerri M"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00520-017-3698-4","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T10:07:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-7339"],"journal":"Supportive Care in Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1492164410,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28405846?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28405846","pubdate":"2017-04-14T22:04:48+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms","healthservices"],"title":"Cancer-specific geriatric assessment and quality of life: important factors in caring for older patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancerspecific-geriatric-assessment-quality-life-important-factors-caring-older-patients-aggressive"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":6989761,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237116,"mean":12.83998490184,"rank":193628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237116,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1787,"mean":4.2997334826428,"rank":1567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1787,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":10.015076923077,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/852825465588809728","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18812253],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T10:06:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":714},"tweet_id":"852825465588809728"}]}}
