Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were prepared by the precipitation polymerization of N-methacryloyl-4-aminobenzamidine as a functional monomer to form a complex with template 2-AC and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as a crosslinking monomer. The 2-AC-imprinted cavities thus constructed preferentially bound 2-AC with an affinity greater than that towards structurally related 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid, 2-aminoanthracene, and unsubstituted anthracene. Moreover, from the four possible regioisomeric cyclodimers, they mediated the [4+4] photocyclodimerization of 2-AC specifically to the anti-head-to-tail (HT) isomer. This indicates that the imprinted cavities accommodate two 2-AC molecules in an anti-HT manner, thereby facilitating the subsequent regioselective photocyclodimerization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Satoshi Nakai","Hirobumi Sunayama","Yukiya Kitayama","Masaki Nishijima","Takehiko Wada","Yoshihisa Inoue","Toshifumi Takeuchi"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b04104","first_seen_on":"2017-04-14T09:17:11+00:00","issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1492161418,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.6b04104"],"pmid":"28177241","pubdate":"2017-03-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Regioselective Molecularly Imprinted Reaction Field for [4 + 4] Photocyclodimerization of 2-Anthracenecarboxylic Acid","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/regioselective-molecularly-imprinted-reaction-field-4-4-photocyclodimerization-2anthracenecarboxylic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":4269671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2238691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237116,"mean":12.839994390907,"rank":132925,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":82768,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237116,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2781,"mean":2.9013395683453,"rank":937,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":1325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2781,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":2.6729473684211,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dzume_lab\/statuses\/852812916587769857","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18811353],"posted_on":"2017-04-14T09:16:58+00:00","author":{"name":"\u3065\u3081\u30e9\u30dc","url":"http:\/\/www.chem.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp\/lab\/hashidzume\/index.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/796923097462902784\/Kxn4qkT5_normal.jpg","description":"MAcromolecular Precise Science (MAPS) Group","id_on_source":"dzume_lab","tweeter_id":"3738431773","geo":{"lt":34.69374,"ln":135.50218,"country":"JP"},"followers":15},"tweet_id":"852812916587769857"}]}}
