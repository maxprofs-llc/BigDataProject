A multi-fusariotoxin, including deoxynivalenol (DON); zearalenone (ZEN); T-2 toxin (T-2); HT-2 toxin (HT-2); enniatin A, A1, B, and B1 (ENNs); and beauvericin (BEA), contaminated wheat flour was obtained by inoculation Fusarium spp. strains. The candidate material has successfully passed the homogeneity test and submitted to an international interlaboratory study achieved by 19 laboratories from 11 countries using their routine analytical method. The dispersion of the results for ZEN and BEA did not allow the derivation of reliable consensus values, while the assignment was only possible for DON, HT-2, T-2, and ENN A. No link was found between the methods used by the participants and the results. Significant changes in dry matter contents (\u2265\u00b11.4\u00a0% of the initial dry matter) and significant changes in ergosterol contents (\u2265\u00b110\u00a0%) did not occur. Using the mycotoxin contents in wheat flour stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C as reference values, statistically significant decreases were observed only for T-2 contents at +24\u00a0\u00b0C, in contrast to the storage at -20 and +4\u00a0\u00b0C. For the other involved toxins, the candidate material was found to be stable at -20, +4, or +24\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on the T-2 decreases, a shelf life of 6\u00a0years was derived from isochronous study when the material is kept at -20\u00a0\u00b0C. At room temperature (e.g., +24\u00a0\u00b0C) or higher, this time validity drastically decreases down to 6\u00a0months. The development of this metrological tool is an important step towards food and feed quality control using multi-mycotoxin analyses. In vivo animal experiments using multi-mycotoxin-contaminated feeds dealing with the carryover or mitigation could further benefit from the methodology of this work.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f610008223","authors":["E.
