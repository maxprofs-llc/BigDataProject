Amorphadiene synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of artemisinin, is able to convert an oxygenated farnesyl diphosphate analogue directly to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde, which can be converted to artemisinin in only four chemical steps, resulting in an efficient synthetic route to the anti-malaria drug.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f1","authors":["Xiaoping Tang","Melodi Demiray","Thomas Wirth","Rudolf K.
