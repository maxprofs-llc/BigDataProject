Successful optimization of a phenotypic screening hit based on a quinoline-4-carboxamide derivative resulted in the highly promising lead structure 4, which according to the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) met the efficacy and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) requirements for a malaria drug target candidate and consequently was selected for preclinical development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Tony Fr\u00f6hlich"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b01486","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T13:42:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-2623","1520-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1477402962,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.6b01486"],"pmid":"27775354","pubdate":"2016-10-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"In Vivo and In Vitro Optimization of Screening Antimalarial Hits toward Lead Molecules for Preclinical Development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/vivo-vitro-optimization-screening-antimalarial-hits-toward-lead-molecules-preclinical-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7591700,"mean":6.5431604635494,"rank":3924443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2127287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7591700,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235116,"mean":12.669097462943,"rank":129018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83448,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235116,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3816,"mean":4.2601148099607,"rank":2564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3816,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":4.9722631578947,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":6,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/brunectin\/statuses\/790911464064163840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13025742],"posted_on":"2016-10-25T13:42:42+00:00","author":{"name":"Professor Payen","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/313994648\/Anselme_Payen_normal.jpg","description":"Biochemistry Twitterfeed.
