We have therefore designed a molecular system integrating the two processes, thereby producing the first embodiment in a chemical species of two entirely different and independent stereomutation mechanisms at the same nominal asymmetric centre. Thus, the energy barrier to the rearrangement of 9-phenyl-9-phosphabarbaralane oxide, easily prepared by a new high-yielding synthesis, was found to be ca. 11 kcal\/mol. This value is in contrast to the parent barbaralane (7.3 kcal\/mol) but in good agreement with our computational results for the rearrangement barriers. Crucially, in the corresponding P-chlorophosphonium derivative, two stereomutations occur simultaneously: fast Cope rearrangement (barrier ca. 12 kcal\/mol) and slow Walden-type inversion of the phosphorus (barrier ca. 21 kcal\/mol). The computational model also revealed a relationship between the Cope rearrangement barrier and the bridgehead distance. The phenomenon of two independent and geometrically orthogonal stereomutations at a single asymmetric centre provides important general insights into reaction pathway bifurcation, microscopic reversibility and dynamic stereochemistry. This first example of co-existing alternative mechanisms involving covalent bonds may encourage the design of new types of dynamic molecular structures.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Gillick-Healy, Malachi  W.","Jennings, Elizabeth  V","Muller-Bunz, Helge","Ortin, Yannick","Nikitin, Kirill","Gilheany, Declan  G.","Gillick\u2010Healy, Malachi W.","Jennings, Elizabeth V.","M\u00fcller\u2010Bunz, Helge","Gilheany, Declan G."],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201604080","endpage":"2339","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T14:28:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765","09476539"],"issue":"10","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1487252163,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604080\/abstract;jsessionid=0EB1573D75B8B80F2D7A1A1AC6D8AF7E.f03t04?systemMessage=Due+to+essential+maintenance+the+subscribe%2Frenew+pages+will+be+unavailable+on+Wednesday+26+October+between+02%3A00+-+08%3A00+BST%2F+09%3A00+%E2%80%93+15%3A00++SGT%2F+21%3A00-+03%3A00+EDT.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604080\/abstract;jsessionid=706C963FF045FC8F993175EAB5D1A595.f01t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604080\/abstract;jsessionid=35ED726CF36463CF7C3D6BF771AB50C6.f01t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604080\/abstract;jsessionid=74B6F79E6699CD5D7ADE1C717DC05FC9.f04t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201604080\/pdf","pmid":"27779793","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2332","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Two independent orthogonal stereomutations at a single asymmetric centre: a narcissistic couple.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/chem.201604080","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/two-independent-orthogonal-stereomutations-single-asymmetric-center-narcissistic-couple"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219010,"mean":6.9619102524339,"rank":4132457,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219010,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244104,"mean":12.933452280389,"rank":125360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":110009,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244104,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6087,"mean":3.1266763062767,"rank":2383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":3486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6087,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":557,"mean":2.3185863309353,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":557,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
