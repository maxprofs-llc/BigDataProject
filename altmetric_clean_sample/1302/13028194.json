Because children's failure to reorient by nongeometric information cannot be attributed to limits on their ability to detect, remember, or use that information for other purposes, this failure suggests that children's reorientation, at least in relatively novel environments, depends on a mechanism that is informationally encapsulated and task-specific: two hallmarks of modular cognitive processes. Parallel studies with rats suggest that children share this mechanism with at least some adult nonhuman mammals. In contrast, our own studies of human adults, who readily solved our tasks by conjoining nongeometric and geometric information, indicated that the most striking limitations of this mechanism are overcome during human development. These findings support broader proposals concerning the domain specificity of humans' core cognitive abilities, the conservation of cognitive abilities across related species and over the course of human development, and the developmental processes by which core abilities are extended to permit more flexible, uniquely human kinds of problem solving.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002589","authors":["Hermer, L","Spelke, E","Linda Hermer","Elizabeth Spelke"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0010-0277(96)00714-7","endpage":"232","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T15:02:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0010-0277","00100277"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1476955018,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0010-0277(96)00714-7"],"pmid":"8990972","pubdate":"1996-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"195","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Modularity and development: the case of spatial reorientation","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0010027796007147","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modularity-development-case-spatial-reorientation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":554596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7003556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234296,"mean":12.683280693143,"rank":29838,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":204320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234296,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1566,"mean":12.132196805112,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":1264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1566,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":19.969420289855,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":5,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":11,"Researcher":41,"Student  > Ph.
