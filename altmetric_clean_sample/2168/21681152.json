Here, we tested a recently released procedure to analyze phosphorylation events in human monocytes upon different types of stimulation.\nWhole blood was treated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), then cells were labeled by antibodies recognizing cell surface and cytosolic proteins. Human monocytes were identified by a CD14 - CD45 staining and three phosphorylated proteins such as AKT, ERK-1\/2, and STAT5, were simultaneously detected by multicolor phosphoflow analysis.\nBy this rapid method, we are able to detect directly from a blood sample several signaling events in human monocytes where LPS stimulation induces preferentially ERK-1\/2 phosphorylation where as GM-CSF stimulation induces STAT5 phosphorylation.\nThis procedure provides a simultaneous measurement of multiple activated signaling molecules using a simplified and rapid protocol. \u00a9 2015 International Clinical Cytometry Society.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000709b","authors":["Coppin, Emilie","Malergue, Fabrice","Thibult, Marie\u2010Laure","Scifo, Caroline","Favre, C\u00e9dric","Nun\u00e8s, Jacques A."],"doi":"10.1002\/cyto.b.21207","endpage":"210","first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T12:27:26+00:00","issns":["15524949","1552-4957"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cytometry Part B: Clinical Cytometry","last_mentioned_on":1496422616,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cyto.b.21207\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cyto.b.21207\/pdf","pmid":"25914252","pubdate":"2015-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"207","subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular phosphoproteins in human monocytes","type":"article","volume":"92","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/flow-cytometric-analysis-intracellular-phosphoproteins-human-monocytes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8307635,"mean":7.0030489970953,"rank":1210902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7021863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8307635,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222123,"mean":11.984868684777,"rank":45034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":175741,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222123,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198,"mean":3.0622741116751,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.4125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
