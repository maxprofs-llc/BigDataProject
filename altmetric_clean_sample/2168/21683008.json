Current was applied and withdrawn over the top and bottom surfaces of each sample and potential drop across different layers was measured using the four-electrode method. We developed a model, which considers of variations in skull thicknesses, to determine the conductivity of the tri-layer skull and its individual anatomical structures. The results indicate that the spongiform and the two compact layers of the skull have significantly different and inhomogeneous conductivities ranging from 0.76 +\/- .14 to 11.5 +\/- 1.8 milliS\/m.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006ce8","authors":["Akhtari, M","Bryant, H C","Mamelak, A N","Heller, L","Shih, J J","Mandelkern, M","Matlachov, A","Ranken, D M","Best, E D","Sutherling, W W"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T13:54:39+00:00","issns":["0896-0267"],"issue":"1","journal":"Brain Topography","last_mentioned_on":1458867180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11073092"],"pmid":"11073092","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Conductivities of three-layer human skull.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conductivities-threelayer-line-human-skull"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8034128,"mean":6.8153894654607,"rank":901579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7087381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8034128,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104446,"mean":10.715595538322,"rank":16432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":87822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104446,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":2.4548761061947,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
