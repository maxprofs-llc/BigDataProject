In this work, we investigate the population distribution of second-level administrative units of 150 countries and territories and propose the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) rank-size function to describe the data. After testing the balance between the goodness of fit and number of parameters of this function compared with a power law, which is the most common model for city population, the DGBD is a good statistical model for 96% of our datasets and preferred over a power law in almost every case. Moreover, the DGBD is preferred over a power law for fitting country population data, which can be seen as the zeroth-level administrative unit. We present a computational toy model to simulate the formation of administrative divisions in one dimension and give numerical evidence that the DGBD arises from a particular case of this model. This model, along with the fitting of the DGBD, proves adequate in reproducing and describing local unit evolution and its effect on the population distribution.","altmetric_jid":"5668333c2a83ee0b398b4567","authors":["Oscar Fontanelli","Pedro Miramontes","Germinal Cocho","Wentian Li","Fontanelli, Oscar","Miramontes, Pedro","Cocho, Germinal","Li, Wentian"],"doi":"10.1098\/rsos.170281","first_seen_on":"2017-07-09T18:56:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2054-5703"],"issue":"7","journal":"Royal Society Open Science","last_mentioned_on":1502374593,"links":["http:\/\/rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/4\/7\/170281","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1098\/rsos.170281","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28791153?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/royopensci\/4\/7\/170281.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5541548","pmid":"28791153","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society","title":"Population patterns in World\u2019s administrative units","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/population-patterns-worlds-administrative-units"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":2.1,"6m":2.1,"3m":2.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":3588530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4727168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227454,"mean":12.733804355185,"rank":90777,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":134620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227454,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":956,"mean":50.624818848168,"rank":732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":956,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":118,"mean":32.150666666667,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":118,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
