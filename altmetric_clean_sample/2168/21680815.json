Both undigested and digested exosomes enter human intestinal crypt-like cells (HIEC), with evidence of nuclear localization. We identified 288 mature microRNAs from all 24 exosome samples, and an additional 610 at low abundance. A large number of synapse development- and immune-related microRNAs were identified. hsa-miR-22-3p was the most abundant miR, and the top 15 microRNAs contributed \u223c11% of the sequencing reads. Upon digestion, the overall microRNA abundance in human milk exosomes was stable.\nOur results for the first time reveal the survivability and complexity of human milk exosome microRNAs upon simulated gastric\/pancreatic digestion, and the dynamics during lactation stages. The results suggest a previously underexplored area of infant response to genetic material in human milk exosomes. This article is protected by copyright.
