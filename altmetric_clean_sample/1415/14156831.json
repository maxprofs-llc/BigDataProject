A low cystometric volume and detrusor compliance were defined as <200\u2009ml and <20\u2009ml\u2009cm(-1) H2O, respectively. The urodynamic study was repeated 4 weeks after imidafenacin was prescribed. When the urodynamic parameters did not improve in the follow-up study, the dose of imidafenacin was increased twofold. Then the urodynamic study was repeated 4 weeks thereafter. We compared the urodynamic parameters before and after imidafenacin treatment. Complications such as vesico-urethral reflux (VUR) and autonomic dysreflexia (AD) were documented.\nFifteen patients took 0.2\u2009mg of imidafenacin daily, and 19 received 0.4\u2009mg of imidafenacin daily. Imidafenacin increased the cystometric volume from 246.0 to 321.5\u2009ml (median, P=0.002), detrusor compliance from 6.67\u2009ml\u2009cm(-1) H2O to 8.98\u2009ml\u2009cm(-1) H2O (median, P=0.012), and decreased the detrusor pressure from 37.0\u2009cm H2O to 30.5\u2009cm H2O (median, P=0.056). All three patients who had VUR fully recovered. Although 3 of 12 patients recovered from AD, 3 patients newly developed symptoms of AD. No patient withdrew from treatment due to adverse effects.\nImidafenacin is a safe drug that may improve the urodynamic parameters of patients with SCI, and it possibly alleviates bladder complications.Spinal Cord advance online publication, 29 November 2016; doi:10.1038\/sc.2016.168.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f6100035a6","authors":["H Sugiyama","O Uemura","T Mori","N Okisio","K Unai","M Liu"],"doi":"10.1038\/sc.2016.168","first_seen_on":"2016-11-29T13:17:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1362-4393","1476-5624"],"journal":"Spinal Cord","last_mentioned_on":1480425440,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/sc\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/sc2016168a.html"],"pmid":"27897185","pubdate":"2016-11-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Spinal cord diseases","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Outcomes research","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Effect of imidafenacin on the urodynamic parameters of patients with indwelling bladder catheters due to spinal cord injury","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-imidafenacin-urodynamic-parameters-patients-indwelling-bladder-catheters-due-spinal-cord-inju"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7822782,"mean":6.6331385505942,"rank":6775891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7822782,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250499,"mean":12.18288539629,"rank":203215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250499,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":918,"mean":4.8899018538713,"rank":839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":918,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":3.155,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/statuses\/803588659140235264","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14156831],"posted_on":"2016-11-29T13:17:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":964},"tweet_id":"803588659140235264"}]}}
