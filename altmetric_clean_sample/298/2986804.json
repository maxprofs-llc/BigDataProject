These reactions include various clinical entities with different mechanisms leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. Characterization of patients based on clinical manifestations and suspected underlying mechanisms is critical for implementation of adequate diagnostic procedures and patient management. Our objectives were to prepare a systematic review of available scientific evidence and to provide general guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs. We also propose a practical algorithm for the diagnosis of specific types of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and provide recommendations for the management of hypersensitive patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cfb","authors":["Ortega N","Do\u00f1a I","Moreno E","Audicana MT","Barasona MJ","Berges-Gimeno MP","Blanca-Lopez N","Lobera T","Padial A","Rosado A","Torres MJ"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-16T11:42:22+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1418727587,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25345301"],"pmid":"25345301","pubdate":"2014-10-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Practical guidelines for diagnosing hypersensitivity reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/practical-guidelines-diagnosing-hypersensitivity-reactions-nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4627399,"mean":5.419528273356,"rank":3167811,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":877244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4627399,"percentile":18},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150560,"mean":8.3411400979019,"rank":101010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":32383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150560,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":259,"mean":2.2609457364341,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":259,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.93970588235294,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
