Recent studies have shown that autophagy plays a key role in ischemic neuronal death, and treatments that target autophagy may represent a novel strategy in neuroprotection. We investigated whether autophagy is regulated by carnosine, an endogenous pleiotropic dipeptide that has robust neuroprotective activity against ischemic brain damage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cfc","authors":["Baek SH","Noh AR","Kim KA","Akram M","Shin YJ","Kim ES","Yu SW","Majid A","Bae ON","S.-H.
