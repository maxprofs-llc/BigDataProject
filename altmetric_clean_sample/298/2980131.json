In this study, we report that the long isoform of the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIPL), a well-known inhibitor of the extrinsic cell death initiator caspase-8, localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). ER morphology was disrupted and ER Ca(2+)-release as well as ER-mitochondria tethering was decreased in c-FLIP(-\/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Mechanistically, c-FLIP ablation resulted in enhanced basal caspase-8 activation and in caspase-mediated processing of the ER-shaping protein reticulon-4 (RTN4) that was corrected by re-introduction of c-FLIPL and caspase inhibition, resulting in the recovery of a normal ER morphology and ER-mitochondria juxtaposition. Thus, the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIPL emerges as a component of the MAMs signaling platforms, where caspases appear to regulate ER morphology and ER-mitochondria crosstalk by impinging on ER-shaping proteins like the RTN4.Cell Death and Differentiation advance online publication, 12 December 2014; doi:10.1038\/cdd.2014.197.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c4","authors":["E S Marini","C Giampietri","S Petrungaro","S Conti","A Filippini","L Scorrano","E Ziparo"],"doi":"10.1038\/cdd.2014.197","first_seen_on":"2014-12-13T12:51:40+00:00","issns":["1350-9047"," 1476-5403"],"journal":"Cell Death & Differentiation","last_mentioned_on":1418473021,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/cdd\/rss\/aop\/~3\/BiqdEsHGngc\/cdd.2014.197"],"pmid":"25501600","pubdate":"2014-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell biology","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"The endogenous caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIPL regulates ER morphology and crosstalk with mitochondria","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endogenous-caspase8-inhibitor-cflipl-regulates-er-morphology-crosstalk-mitochondria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4614200,"mean":5.4146155701656,"rank":599949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3986128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4614200,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149540,"mean":8.3661275787587,"rank":25168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":122866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149540,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":866,"mean":4.3727606936416,"rank":200,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":618,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":866,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":10.206226415094,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
