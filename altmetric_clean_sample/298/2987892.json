Atomic layer deposition (ALD), enabling uniform and conformal nanofilms, has recently made possible many new advances for superior LIBs. The progress was summarized by Liu and Sun in their latest review [1], offering many insightful views, covering the design of nanostructured battery components (i.e., electrodes and solid electrolytes), and nanoscale modification of electrode\/electrolyte interfaces. This work well informs peers of interesting research conducted and it will also further help boost the applications of ALD in next-generation LIBs and other advanced battery technologies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/26\/2\/020501","first_seen_on":"2014-12-16T15:40:55+00:00","issns":["0957-4484"],"issue":"2","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1418744434,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/26\/2\/020501"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/beta.iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/26\/2\/020501\/pdf\/0957-4484_26_2_020501.pdf","pmid":"25514439","pubdate":"2015-01-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"020501","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Towards high-energy and durable lithium-ion batteries via atomic layer deposition: elegantly atomic-scale material design and surface modification","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/towards-highenergy-durable-lithiumion-batteries-via-atomic-layer-deposition-elegantly-atomicscale-ma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4627399,"mean":5.419528273356,"rank":3750198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4627399,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150559,"mean":8.3411485407617,"rank":118171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150559,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1021,"mean":5.3168725490196,"rank":889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1021,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":4.6648888888889,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
