It discusses the various factors in terms of definition, inclusion criteria and policy which can result in marked differences in the apparent rates of delivery (all births), live birth, admission to neonatal intensive care and ultimately survival seen between otherwise similar countries, different regions of the same country, and even adjacent hospitals. Such variation in approach can result in major differences in reported survival and consequentially have large effects on apparent rates of adverse long-term outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088f5","authors":["Smith LK","Draper ES","Field D"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.siny.2013.11.002","endpage":"77","first_seen_on":"2014-12-15T15:24:53+00:00","issns":["1744165X","1744-165X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Seminars in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1426084100,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1744165X13001108"],"pmid":"24289904","pubdate":"2013-11-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"72","subjects":["perinatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Long-term outcome for the tiniest or most immature babies: survival rates ","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-outcome-tiniest-most-immature-babies-survival-rates"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4859554,"mean":5.7905345940297,"rank":933704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3921561,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4859554,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169376,"mean":8.0688601977862,"rank":37081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":132128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169376,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148,"mean":2.7269931972789,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":4.4178571428571,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
