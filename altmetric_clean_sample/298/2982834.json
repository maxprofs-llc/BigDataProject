Effective interventions to significantly reduce weight, maintain weight loss and manage associated pathologies like BED are typically combined treatment options (dietetic, nutritional, physical, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, pharmacological, surgical). Significant difficulties with regard to availability, costs, treatment adherence and long-term efficacy are present. Particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the therapeutic approach indicated both in in-patient and in out-patient settings for BED. In recent years systemic and systemic-strategic psychotherapies have been implemented to treat patients with obesity and BED involved in familiar problems. Particularly a brief protocol for the systemic-strategic treatment of BED, using overall the strategic dialogue, has been recently developed. Moreover telemedicine, a new promising low cost method, has been used for obesity with BED in out-patient settings in order to avoid relapse after the in-patient step of treatment and to keep on a continuity of care with the involvement of the same clinical in-patient team.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a6","authors":["Castelnuovo G","Manzoni GM","Villa V","Cesa GL","Pietrabissa G","Molinari E"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6215-12-114","first_seen_on":"2014-12-15T07:29:33+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"","journal":"Trials","last_mentioned_on":1418628563,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21554734"],"pmcid":"PMC3113986","pmid":"21554734","pubdate":"2011-05-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Statistics for Life Sciences, Medicine, Health Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The STRATOB study: design of a randomized controlled clinical trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Brief Strategic Therapy with telecare in patients with obesity and binge-eating disorder referred to residential nutritional rehabilitation.","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stratob-study-design-randomized-controlled-clinical-trial-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-brief-strateg-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751743,"mean":5.7090453943038,"rank":3977647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751743,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161887,"mean":8.2046472950103,"rank":128424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161887,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1557,"mean":4.7218573264781,"rank":1369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1557,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":5.5008444444444,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":17,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Ph.
