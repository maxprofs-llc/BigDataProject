Although phenotypic variation has been noted in the context of antibiotic exposure, no direct evidence exists for heterogeneity in virulence-specific transcriptional programs within tissues. In a mouse model of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection, we show that at least three subpopulations of bacteria develop within a single tissue site in response to distinct host signals. Bacteria growing on the exterior of spleen microcolonies responded to soluble signals and induced the nitric oxide (NO)-detoxifying gene, hmp. Hmp effectively eliminated NO diffusion and protected the interior bacterial population from exposure to NO-derived inducing signals. A third subpopulation, constituting the most peripherally localized bacteria, directly contacted neutrophils and transcriptionally upregulated a virulence factor. These studies demonstrate that growth within tissues results in transcriptional specialization within a single focus of microbial replication, facilitating directed pathogen counterattack against the host response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e1c","doi":"10.1016\/j.chom.2014.11.008","first_seen_on":"2014-12-15T15:05:58+00:00","funders":["niaid"],"issns":["1931-3128"],"journal":"Cell Host & Microbe (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1426019563,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-host-microbe%2Fabstract%2FS1931-3128%252814%252900424-7&code=cell-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-host-microbe%2Fabstract%2FS1931-3128%252814%252900424-7&code=cell-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?code=cell-site&rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fcell-host-microbe%2Fabstract%2FS1931-3128%252814%252900424-7","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1931312814004247"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1931312814004247\/pdf","pmid":"25500192","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Community Behavior and Spatial Regulation within a Bacterial Microcolony in Deep Tissue Sites Serves to Protect against Host Attack","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/community-behavior-spatial-regulation-within-bacterial-microcolony-deep-tissue-sites-serves-protect-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6898644,"mean":6.1924307725427,"rank":1149542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5745711,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6898644,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230674,"mean":7.3700566776347,"rank":43806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":186679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230674,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1019,"mean":18.776836935167,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1019,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":20.051317073171,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":5,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
