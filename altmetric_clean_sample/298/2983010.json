Measures of quality control and evaluation of conformity are inherently sensitive to shift. It is essential to be able to compare test samples to reference samples in an evolutionary analytical environment by offsetting the inevitable drift. Therefore, prior to any multivariate analysis, the alignment of analytical signals is a compulsory preprocessing step. During recent years, many researchers have taken a greater interest in the study of the alignment. The present paper is an updated review on the alignment algorithms, methods, and improvements used in chromatography. The study is dedicated to one-dimensional signals. Several of the exposed methods have common theoretical bases and can differ through their optimization methods. The main issue for the operator is to choose the appropriate method according to the type of signals to be processed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e43","authors":["Korifi, Rabia","Le Dr\u00e9au, Yveline","Dupuy, Nathalie"],"doi":"10.1002\/jssc.201400700","first_seen_on":"2014-12-15T09:38:49+00:00","issns":["1615-9314"],"journal":"Journal of Separation Science (JSS) (formerly Journal of High Resolution Chromatography)","last_mentioned_on":1418630400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jssc.201400700"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jssc.201400700\/pdf","pmid":"25197022","pubdate":"2014-10-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Comparative study of the alignment method on experimental and simulated chromatographic data","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-study-alignment-method-experimental-simulated-chromatographic-data"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4622892,"mean":5.418014936983,"rank":601738,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3992725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4622892,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150386,"mean":8.3109289224325,"rank":25332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":123524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150386,"percentile":82},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":0.97934383688601,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":1051,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.1068181818182,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
