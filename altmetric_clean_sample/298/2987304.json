As an alternative to traditional LC-MS\/MS, we present here a methodology that preserves the intact analyte ion for quantification by selectively filtering ions while reducing chemical noise. Utilizing a quadrupole-Orbitrap MS, the target ion is selectively isolated while interfering matrix components undergo MS\/MS fragmentation by CID, allowing noise-free detection of the analyte's surviving molecular ion. In this manner, CID affords additional selectivity during high resolution accurate mass analysis by elimination of isobaric interferences, a fundamentally different concept than the traditional approach of monitoring a target analyte's unique fragment following CID. This survivor-selected ion monitoring (survivor-SIM) approach has allowed sensitive and specific detection of disulfide-rich cyclic peptides extracted from plasma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Eugene Ciccimaro"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac502678y","first_seen_on":"2014-12-16T13:31:09+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1418746023,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac502678y"],"pmid":"25371986","pubdate":"2014-11-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Strategy to Improve the Quantitative LC-MS Analysis of Molecular Ions Resistant to Gas-Phase Collision Induced Dissociation: Application to Disulfide-Rich Cyclic Peptides.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/strategy-improve-quantitative-lcms-analysis-molecular-ions-resistant-gasphase-collision-induced-diss"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4627399,"mean":5.419528273356,"rank":2179815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2402837,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4627399,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150559,"mean":8.3411945031151,"rank":67132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":81788,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150559,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5156,"mean":2.623759456838,"rank":1872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5156,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":399,"mean":2.6692211055276,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":399,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
