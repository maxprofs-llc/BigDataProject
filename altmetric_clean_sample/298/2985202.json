In a 2 (testimonial consistency) x 2 (confidence) between-groups design, 130 mock-jurors listened to an audio-taped trial of a person charged with armed robbery. Manipulations were contained in the prosecution witness's responses to detailed questioning by prosecution and defense attorneys. Although consistency is considered to be a key marker of accuracy, its impact on judgments was weak and nonsignificant. Witness confidence had a strong influence on judgments, whether testimony was consistent or inconsistent. We suggested that witness confidence may be more likely to emerge as a dominant influence on juror judgments when the testimony is wide ranging rather than relatively brief and concerned only with a specific issue (e.g., identification confidence).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5b83cf058f61000552e","authors":["Neil Brewer","Anne Burke"],"first_seen_on":"2014-12-15T22:56:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0147-7307"],"issue":"3","journal":"Law and Human Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1418670168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12061623"],"pmid":"12061623","pubdate":"2002-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Law","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","jurisprudence"],"title":"Effects of testimonial inconsistencies and eyewitness confidence on mock-juror judgments.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-testimonial-inconsistencies-eyewitness-confidence-mockjuror-judgments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4622892,"mean":5.418014936983,"rank":408131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":4197578,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4622892,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150385,"mean":8.3130739041388,"rank":19012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":130905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150385,"percentile":87},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":307,"mean":7.0462679738562,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":307,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.9666666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
