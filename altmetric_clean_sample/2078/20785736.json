Alterations in monoaminergic activity have also been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. The present studies examined the ability of centrally administered BDNF to produce antidepressant-like activity in two animal models of depression, learned helplessness following exposure to inescapable shock and the forced swim test. In the learned helplessness paradigm, vehicle-infused rats pre-exposed to inescapable shock (veh\/shock) showed severe impairments in escape behavior during subsequent conditioned avoidance trials, including a 47% decrease in the number of escapes and a 5 fold increase in escape latency, as compared to vehicle-infused rats which received no pre-shock treatment (veh\/no shock). Midbrain BDNF infusion (12-24 micrograms\/day) reversed these deficits, and in fact, BDNF-infused rats pre-exposed to inescapable shock (BDNF\/shock) showed escape latencies similar to veh\/no shock and BDNF\/no shock rats. In the forced swim test, BDNF infusion decreased the immobility time by 70% as compared to vehicle-infused controls. Non-specific increases in activity could not account for these effects since general locomotor activity of BDNF- and vehicle-infused animals was not different. These findings demonstrate an antidepressant-like property of BDNF in two animal models of depression, which may be mediated by increased activity in monoaminergic systems.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032e3","authors":["Judith A Siuciak","Dacie R Lewis","Stanley J Wiegand","Ronald M Lindsay"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0091-3057(96)00169-4","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T01:16:47+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["00913057","0091-3057"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pharmacology, Biochemistry & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1439424000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0091-3057(96)00169-4"],"pmid":"8981620","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","behavioralsciences","pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Antidepressant-Like Effect of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antidepressantlike-effect-brainderived-neurotrophic-factor-bdnf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7847180,"mean":6.6492596223381,"rank":1926446,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4837492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7847180,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104100,"mean":10.789898154641,"rank":30624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":72509,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104100,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1515,"mean":3.7275508586526,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1515,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.6555555555556,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
