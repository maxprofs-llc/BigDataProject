In the present study, we investigated the effects of low temperature on biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and apoptosis in pufferfish. In the stress group, water temperature decreased from 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 13\u00a0\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00a0\u00b0C\/1\u00a0h. Fish blood and liver were collected to assay biochemical parameters, oxidative stress and expression of genes at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 21\u00a0\u00b0C, 17\u00a0\u00b0C, 13\u00a0\u00b0C and 13\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The results showed that low temperature could decrease total blood cell count, inhibit cell viability, and subsequently lead to DNA damage. Biochemical parameters such as plasma protein and ALP significantly declined in fish under low temperature, while a significant increase in AST, ALT, LDH and glucose was observed. The gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT), HSP90 and C3 were induced by low temperature stress. Furthermore, the gene expression of apoptotic related genes including P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were up-regulated, suggesting that caspase-dependent pathway could play important roles in low temperature-induced apoptosis in fish. This study may provide baseline information about how cold stress affects the physiological responses and apoptosis in fish.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028d8","authors":["Chang-Hong Cheng","Chao-Xia Ye","Zhi-Xun Guo","An-Li Wang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fsi.2017.03.003","first_seen_on":"2017-06-03T02:26:33+00:00","issns":["10504648"],"journal":"Fish & Shellfish Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1496456782,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28263881?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28263881","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Fisheries Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immune and physiological responses of pufferfish ( Takifugu obscurus ) under cold stress","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immune-physiological-responses-pufferfish-takifugu-obscurus-under-cold-stress"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0.85,"6m":0.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":5999455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2302646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241991,"mean":12.178546559775,"rank":156297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":85457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241991,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1197,"mean":0.9251220735786,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1197,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":0.88212987012987,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
