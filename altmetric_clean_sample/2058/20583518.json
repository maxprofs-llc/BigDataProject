A transformative change is understood to be one that significantly alters the value an individual places on his or her experiences or achievements. The clearest examples of transformative change come from science fiction, but the concept can be illuminatingly applied to the enhancement debate. We argue that it helps to expose a threat from too much enhancement to many of the things that make human lives valuable. Among the things threated by enhancement are our relationships with other human beings. The potential to lose these relationships provides a compelling reason for almost all humans to reject too much enhancement.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000248b","authors":["Agar, Nicholas","McDonald, Johnny"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0963180116001122","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T14:44:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1469-2147"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics","last_mentioned_on":1495806939,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28541173?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28541173","pubdate":"2017-05-26T22:09:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Ethics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["ethics"],"title":"Human Enhancement and the Story of Job.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-enhancement-story-job"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8272014,"mean":6.980828736602,"rank":7153803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8272014,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238309,"mean":12.09909757121,"rank":193345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238309,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229,"mean":4.4756315789474,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.805,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Philosophy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Neuro_Skeptic\/statuses\/868103338105110528","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20583518],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T13:55:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Neuroskeptic","url":"http:\/\/blogs.discovermagazine.com\/neuroskeptic\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/703637604181393409\/iCflIKVK_normal.jpg","description":"Neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry through a skeptical lens.
