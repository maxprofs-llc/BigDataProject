Data were also stratified with respect to first infection and reinfection. Infection was significantly (p less than 0.001) more prevalent in males (7.5%) than females (4.1%). Among all age groups peak infection (9.9%) occurred in those aged 30-39 years. Non-vegetarian communities had a higher incidence than vegetarian communities. Between-community difference was significant (p less than 0.01). First infection cases (11.0%) peaked in those aged 20-29 years while people aged 30-39 years were most susceptible to reinfection (84.6%). Between-age differences with respect to first and reinfection were insignificant (p greater then 0.05). Of various water sources reported pond water was a major source of contamination. 82.7% of the population examined was at risk of developing guinea worm infection at any time. No effective treatment is yet available.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b49","authors":["SYLVESTER JOHNSON","VINOD JOSHI"],"doi":"10.1093\/ije\/11.1.26","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T15:56:53+00:00","issns":["0300-5771","1464-3685"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":662688000,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/ije\/11.1.26"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/11\/1\/26.full.pdf","pmid":"6211411","pubdate":"1982-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Dracontiasis in Rajasthan.
