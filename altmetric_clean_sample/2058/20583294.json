The stated goal is utilitarian, to inform and empower the public and ensure the accountability of policy and decision-making around the use of scientific evidence. However, it is questionable what constitutes uncertainty around the evidence on any given topic, and, while the goal is laudable, we argue the drive to increase transparency on uncertainty of the scientific process specifically does more harm than good, and may not serve the interests of those intended. While highlighting some of the practical implications of making uncertainties transparent using current guidelines, the aim is to discuss what could be done to make it worthwhile for both public and scientists.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6023cf058f6100063bc","authors":["Osman, Magda","Heath, Amanda J.","L\u00f6fstedt, Ragnar"],"doi":"10.1177\/0963662517711058","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T14:38:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0963-6625","1361-6609"],"journal":"Public Understanding of Science","last_mentioned_on":1496235058,"links":["http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0963662517711058","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0963662517711058"],"pmid":"28535719","pubdate":"2017-05-26T22:23:43+00:00","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Journalism And Professional Writing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"History And Philosophy Of Specific Fields","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["science","historyofmedicine"],"title":"The problems of increasing transparency on uncertainty","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/problems-increasing-transparency-uncertainty"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":2,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":3593493,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4584359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239541,"mean":12.126326208566,"rank":97194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":138502,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239541,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":634,"mean":11.283172195893,"rank":438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":634,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":8.274,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
