Its distribution and transmission are closely related to geographic and environmental factors. Identification of environmental determinates of TBE is of great importance to understanding the general distribution of existing and potential TBE natural foci. Hulunbuir, one of the most severe endemic areas of the disease, is selected as the study area. Statistical analysis, global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and regression methods were applied to detect the spatiotemporal characteristics, compare the impact degree of associated factors, and model the risk distribution using the heterogeneity. The statistical analysis of gridded geographic and environmental factors and TBE incidence show that the TBE patients mainly occurred during spring and summer and that there is a significant positive spatial autocorrelation between the distribution of TBE cases and environmental characteristics. The impact degree of these factors on TBE risks has the following descending order: temperature, relative humidity, vegetation coverage, precipitation and topography. A high-risk area with a triangle shape was determined in the central part of Hulunbuir; the low-risk area is located in the two belts next to the outside edge of the central triangle. The TBE risk distribution revealed that the impact of the geographic factors changed depending on the heterogeneity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["Yifan Li","Juanle Wang","Mengxu Gao","Liqun Fang","Changhua Liu","Xin Lyu","Yongqing Bai","Qiang Zhao","Hairong Li","Hongjie Yu","Wuchun Cao","Liqiang Feng","Yanjun Wang","Bin Zhang"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph14060569","first_seen_on":"2017-05-26T16:10:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"6","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1496916098,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/6\/569?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28587151?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/14\/6\/569\/pdf","pmid":"28587151","pubdate":"2017-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"Geographical Environment Factors and Risk Assessment of Tick-Borne Encephalitis in Hulunbuir, Northeastern China","type":"article","volume":"14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6028393,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2010291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241497,"mean":12.455920785437,"rank":156181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":71167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241497,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3203,"mean":7.9796845721424,"rank":2225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3203,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242,"mean":5.34377593361,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/P_Doggy_Bone\/statuses\/868124027641921536","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20587780],"posted_on":"2017-05-26T15:17:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Precious Daniel\u2122","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/precious.ogunleye","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/891043583511470080\/FfBKDjay_normal.jpg","description":"All I want is to be RICH and FAMOUS through God's blessings.
