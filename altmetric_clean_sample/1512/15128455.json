Owing to technological advances, knowledge of epitranscriptomic marks and their writers, readers and erasers has recently advanced tremendously. Here we focus on the roles of the dynamic methylation and demethylation of internal adenosines in mRNA in germ cells and pluripotent stem cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","authors":["Arne Klungland","John Arne Dahl","Gareth Greggains","Peter Fedorcsak","Adam Filipczyk"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.4111","endpage":"22","first_seen_on":"2016-12-29T15:42:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1548-7091","1548-7105"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1483432257,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/v14\/n1\/full\/nmeth.4111.html"],"pmid":"28032624","pubdate":"2016-12-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Research","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"RNA metabolism","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Epigenetics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Germline development","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Embryonic stem cells","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Cancer genetics","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"18","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Reversible RNA modifications in meiosis and pluripotency","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reversible-rna-modifications-meiosis-pluripotency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7976486,"mean":6.7343932358615,"rank":3602499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4294235,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7976486,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255017,"mean":12.448508987671,"rank":116673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":134572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255017,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2786,"mean":20.405987791741,"rank":2097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2786,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":34.309710843373,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
