In this project, we used text mining techniques to extract meaningful words and word patterns from 45 transcribed in-depth interviews of people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) conducted in Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, and San Francisco from 2006 to 2013. Text mining analysis can predict whether an emerging field will become a long-lasting source of academic interest or whether it is simply a passing source of interest that will soon disappear. The data were analyzed by age group (45 and older vs. 44 and younger). The highest ranking fragments in the order of frequency were: \"care\", \"daughter\", \"disease\", \"family\", \"HIV\", \"hospital\", \"husband\", \"medicines\", \"money\", \"people\", \"son\", \"tell\/disclosure\", \"thought\", \"want\", and \"years\". Participants in the 44-year-old and younger group were focused mainly on disease disclosure, their families, and their financial condition. In older PLWHA, social supports were one of the main concerns. In this study, we learned that different age groups perceive the disease differently. Therefore, when designing intervention, researchers should consider to tailor an intervention to a specific population and to help PLWHA achieve a better quality of life. Promoting self-management can be an effective strategy for every encounter with HIV-positive individuals.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Chen, Wei-Ti","Barbour, Russell","Wei-Ti Chen"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2016.1221029","endpage":"4","first_seen_on":"2016-10-05T00:35:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1360-0451","0954-0121"],"journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1477226807,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27684610","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09540121.2016.1221029"],"pmid":"27684610","pubdate":"2016-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Life priorities in the HIV-positive Asians: a text-mining analysis in young vs. old generation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/life-priorities-hivpositive-asians-textmining-analysis-young-vs-old-generation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":3276935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4222069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241878,"mean":12.497988622316,"rank":103867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":134337,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241878,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1465,"mean":3.3668948087432,"rank":812,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1465,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":4.83,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
