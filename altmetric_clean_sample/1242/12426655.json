We have investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of PI3K\u03b4 and JAK inhibition on cytokine release from asthma bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and T-cell activation, and measured lung PI3K\u03b4 and JAK signalling pathway expression.\nCells isolated from asthma patients and healthy subjects were treated with PI3K\u03b4 or JAK inhibitors, and\/or dexamethasone, before T-cell receptor stimulation. Levels of IFN\u03b3, IL-13 and IL-17 were measured by ELISA and flow cytometry was used to assess T-cell activation. PI3K\u03b4, PI3K\u03b3, phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry in bronchial biopsy tissue from asthma patients and healthy subjects. PI3K\u03b4 expression in BAL CD3 cells was measured by flow cytometry.\nJAK and PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors reduced cytokine levels from both asthma and healthy BAL cells. Combining dexamethasone with either a JAK or PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor showed an additive anti-inflammatory effect. JAK and PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors were shown to have direct effects on T-cell activation. Immunohistochemistry showed increased numbers of PI3K\u03b4 expressing cells in asthma bronchial tissue compared to controls. Asthma CD3 cells in BAL expressed higher levels of PI3K\u03b4 protein compared to healthy cells.\nTargeting PI3K\u03b4 or JAK may prove effective in reducing T-cell activation and the resulting cytokine production in asthma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000892","authors":["Thomas Southworth","Jonathan Plumb","Vandana Gupta","James Pearson","Isabel Ramis","Martin D.
