Despite helium being the second most abundant element in the universe (He\/H \u223c 1\/10), it has never been observed in any other form than that of a neutral\/ionized atom in the interstellar medium. Because He is the \"most noble\" gas, its non-observation as part of neutral molecular systems is understandable. It is more surprising for charged species, especially HeH(+) whose spectral signatures are well documented in the laboratory. The purpose of this work was to find a simple positive ion containing He, and likely to be observed as an alternative to undetected HeH(+). Among the HeX(2+) diatomics formed with first row atoms, we focused on X = C because of both its relative abundance and the magnitude of its ionization potentials with respect to He. The formation of CHe(2+) by radiative association is the center of this study. The question was addressed by means of numerical simulations using high level ab initio calculations of the CHe(2+) potential surface, followed by a quantum chemical determination of the rate coefficients for the corresponding radiative association in the range of 10 to 1000K. The radiative association path shows a potential well deep enough to accommodate 20 vibrational levels, and no barrier to oppose the reaction. The rate coefficient varies from \u223c4.5 \u00d7 10(-20) cm(3)s(-1) to \u223c2.5 \u00d7 10(-22) cm(3)s(-1) for the temperatures considered. The present study suggests that the existence of this species has to be searched for mainly in highly irradiated regions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["E. Zicler","M.-C.
