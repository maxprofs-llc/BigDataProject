The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the studies, and the pooled odd ratios with a 95% confidence interval were used to identify the risk factors. We employed Review Manager 5.2 and Stata 10.0 to analyze the data. Heterogeneity was assessed by both the Chi-square and I\u00b2 tests, and publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's test.\nThirty-four articles reporting 13,587 lead-poisoned children met the inclusion criteria. Unhealthy lifestyle and behaviors, environmental pollution around the home and potential for parents' occupational exposure to lead were risk factors of child lead poisoning in the pooled analyses. Our assessments yielded no severe publication biases.\nSeventeen risk factors are associated with child lead poisoning, which can be used to identify high-risk children. Health education and promotion campaigns should be designed in order to minimize or prevent child lead poisoning in China.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f6100078a4","authors":["You Li"],"doi":"10.3390\/ijerph13030296","first_seen_on":"2016-10-04T12:59:07+00:00","issns":["1660-4601"],"issue":"3","journal":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1475585936,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/3\/296"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-4601\/13\/3\/296\/pdf","pmid":"27005641","pubdate":"2016-03-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"296","subjects":["publichealth","environmentalhealth"],"title":"The Risk Factors of Child Lead Poisoning in China: A Meta-Analysis","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/risk-factors-child-lead-poisoning-china-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7476637,"mean":6.4841716895094,"rank":1800580,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4681524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7476637,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239610,"mean":12.528658389292,"rank":80455,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":156050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239610,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2700,"mean":7.3613130789181,"rank":798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2700,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":177,"mean":4.8723295454545,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":132,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":177,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Environmental Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2,"Chemical Engineering":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/shinsider_eco\/statuses\/783290300445913088","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12420965],"posted_on":"2016-10-04T12:58:55+00:00","author":{"name":"shinsider_eco","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"shinsider_eco","tweeter_id":"352526944","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"783290300445913088"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/shinsider_asia\/statuses\/783290304740880386","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12420965],"posted_on":"2016-10-04T12:58:56+00:00","author":{"name":"shinsider_asia","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"shinsider_asia","tweeter_id":"398942550","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1},"tweet_id":"783290304740880386"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/shinsider_nr\/statuses\/783290300483641344","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12420965],"posted_on":"2016-10-04T12:58:55+00:00","author":{"name":"SH Insider","url":"http:\/\/www.schoolhealthinsider.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1227387699\/ISHN-Globe_normal.png","description":"Country, state\/provincial reports, studies, surveys, web sites and other information on school health, safety, environmental and social development programs","id_on_source":"shinsider_nr","tweeter_id":"234477266","geo":{"lt":60.10867,"ln":-113.64258,"country":"CA"},"followers":0},"tweet_id":"783290300483641344"}]}}
