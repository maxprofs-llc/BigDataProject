Principal components analysis of the ratings identified three independent dimensions, describing feelings of fulfillment, distress and difficulty, respectively. Ratings by 104 primiparous antenatal patients in the third trimester yielded similar dimensions. The postnatal sample was divided, in turn, according to obstetric procedure at delivery, antenatal classes attended, whether the present pregnancy was planned and history of previous termination. Their experience of childbirth was compared on each dimension. Forceps and unassisted deliveries were experienced similarly. Caesarian section was a less difficult, but also less fulfilling and more distressing, experience than either of these. Delivery was less distressing in those who attended antenatal classes, but only one type of class was associated with more fulfilling birth. Finally, delivery was more distressing in women whose pregnancy was unplanned, or in whom a previous pregnancy had been terminated. Future controlled investigations will be incomplete unless each of the three dimensions is measured.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eec","authors":["Salmon, P","Drew, N C","Peter Salmon","Nicholas C.
