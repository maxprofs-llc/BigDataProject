Our strategy, based on the simple combination of oleylamine and ClCo(PPh3)3, allows the one-pot synthesis of size-controlled hcp-nanocrystals. The size and shape of the nanocrystals can be tuned by varying the reaction time or the concentration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Lynda Meziane","Caroline Salzemann","Corinne Aubert","H\u00e9l\u00e8ne G\u00e9rard","Christophe Petit","Marc Petit"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6nr05792f","first_seen_on":"2016-10-19T10:16:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2040-3372"],"journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1476872150,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/nr\/c6nr05792f"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/nr\/c6nr05792f","pmid":"27806144","pubdate":"2016-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"HCP Cobalt Nanocrystals with High Magnetic Anisotropy prepared by Easy One-Pot Synthesis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hcp-cobalt-nanocrystals-high-magnetic-anisotropy-prepared-easy-onepot-synthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":3905905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2116350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236215,"mean":12.545744680671,"rank":129647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":83437,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236215,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2009,"mean":4.6039521912351,"rank":746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2009,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":12.217103448276,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
