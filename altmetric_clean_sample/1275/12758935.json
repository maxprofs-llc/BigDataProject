Noncycloplegic automated refraction with supplemental subjective refraction was performed. Myopia, high myopia, hyperopia, and high hyperopia were defined as a spherical equivalent of < -0.5 diopter (D), < -5.0D, > +0.5D, and \u2265 +3.0D, respectively. Astigmatism and high astigmatism were defined as a cylinder of > 0.5D and > 2.25D, respectively. Risk factor assessment was guided by a conceptual model.\nData from 4144 participants were analyzed. The overall prevalence of myopia, high myopia, hyperopia, high hyperopia, astigmatism, and high astigmatism was 35.1% (95% confidence interval, 33.6%-36.6%), 7.4% (6.6%-8.3%), 40.2% (38.7%-41.8%), 2.7% (2.2%-3.3%), 45.6% (44.1%-47.2%), and 3.7% (3.1%-4.3%), respectively. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia was lower among older individuals (Ps < 0.05). Reversed age trends were observed for the other refractive errors (Ps < 0.05). There was no sex difference in the prevalence of refractive errors, except for a higher prevalence of hyperopia among females (P = 0.010). Age, acculturation, education, income, marital status, birth country, history of ocular disease, non-ocular comorbidities, and recent eye exam were associated with prevalence of myopia. All of these factors, except for acculturation, were also associated with high myopia.\nOur data present the first population-based estimates of the prevalence of refractive errors among adult Chinese Americans. Compared with whites, Hispanics, and blacks, Chinese Americans have a higher burden of myopia, high myopia, and astigmatism.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Rohit Varma","Mina Torres","Roberta McKean-Cowdin","Fen Rong","Chunyi Hsu","Xuejuan Jiang","Varma, Rohit","Torres, Mina","McKean-Cowdin, Roberta","Rong, Fen","Hsu, Chunyi","Jiang, Xuejuan",", ","Stanley P.
