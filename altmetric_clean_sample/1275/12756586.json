Estimation of the inhomogeneous magnetic field from a measured phase is not an easy task due to phase wrapping and chemical-dependent phase shifts. Using the proposed partial differential phase technique, such problems are resolved. The proposed technique uses most of the 3D pixel data regardless of chemical compounds for the estimation of the inhomogeneous magnetic field. A large number of partial difference data compared to the number of expansion terms for the model of inhomogeneous magnetic field provides a very stable estimation, robust to noise. The technique is applicable to in vivo shimming, water-fat imaging, eddy current compensation, and most phase-related measurements and imaging. The efficacy of the proposed technique is demonstrated with in vivo water-fat imaging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000330e","authors":["Young-Joong Yang","Jinho Park","Jong-Hyun Yoon","Chang-Beom Ahn"],"doi":"10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/10\/4075","endpage":"4088","first_seen_on":"2016-10-19T08:58:46+00:00","issns":["1361-6560","0031-9155"],"issue":"10","journal":"Physics in Medicine & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1430406101,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0031-9155\/60\/10\/4075"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/article\/10.1088\/0031-9155\/60\/10\/4075\/pdf","pmid":"25928054","pubdate":"2015-04-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"4075","subjects":["biophysics","biology"],"title":"Field inhomogeneity correction using partial differential phases in magnetic resonance imaging","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/field-inhomogeneity-correction-using-partial-differential-phases-magnetic-resonance-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6341884,"mean":5.9777754783564,"rank":5398569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6341884,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81594,"mean":11.265227850428,"rank":64582,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81594,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1047,"mean":1.9807361376673,"rank":789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1047,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.3113636363636,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
