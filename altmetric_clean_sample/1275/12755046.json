Often the diagnosis and treatment are delayed, resulting in attempted surgical repair months or even years after the injury.\nWe present a case report of a 31-year old female who suffered a left main bronchus transection after a motor vehicle accident. The diagnostic, management issues, and clinical findings surrounding this injury are reviewed.\nTracheobronchial disruption is a rare, life-threatening injury. Suspicion should be high when pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are refractory to adequate pleural drainage. Flexible bronchoscopy with intubation distal to the injury may be necessary to prevent loss of the airway. Advance preparation should include setups for bronchoscopy, thoracotomy, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Patient survival depends on preparation and prompt surgical intervention.\nA high level of suspicion and the liberal use of bronchoscopy are important in the diagnosis of tracheobronchial injury. A tailored surgical approach is often necessary for definitive repair.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f2","authors":["Ali Cheaito","Areti Tillou","Catherine Lewis","Henry Cryer"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijscr.2016.08.014","endpage":"175","first_seen_on":"2016-10-19T07:22:58+00:00","issns":["2210-2612","22102612"],"journal":"International Journal of Surgery Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1476861764,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5021783\/","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S2210261216303091&_version=1&md5=9d23ccf4b20e24d833ca016fbd10d945"],"pmid":"27621099","pubdate":"2016-10-19T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"172","title":"Traumatic bronchial injury","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/traumatic-bronchial-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8232912,"mean":6.9719612239153,"rank":3894064,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4156037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8232912,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246770,"mean":12.773742617589,"rank":116757,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":122951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246770,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":953,"mean":1.8633844537815,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":819,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":953,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":0.7795,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Arts and Humanities":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IJSCaseReports\/statuses\/772399168115519488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12755046],"posted_on":"2016-09-04T11:41:26+00:00","author":{"name":"IJS Case Reports","url":"http:\/\/www.casereports.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681556822805843970\/-0rB28HV_normal.png","description":"The Largest Journal for Surgical Case Reports in the World.
