In the present study, we observed that STE was involved in oral toxicity by reducing the viability of human squamous epithelial cells, SCC-25, along with the simultaneous induction of both apoptosis and autophagic signalling. STE was also found to induce significant amount ROS generation in SCC-25 cells. The dietary flavonoid morin, found abundantly in a variety of herbs, fruits and wine, has been reported to attenuate ROS- induced pathogenesis including autophagy. In this study we designed three different treatment regimes of morin treatment, such as pre, co, and post - treatment of STE challenged SCC-25 cells. In all cases morin provided cytoprotection to STE challenged SCC-25 cells by augmenting STE induced ROS-dependent cytotoxic autophagy. Hence, morin is a potential option for antioxidant therapy in treatment of STE induced toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100028f2","authors":["Ganguli, Arnab","Das, Amlan","Nag, Debasish","Bhattacharya, Surela","Chakrabarti, Gopal"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.fct.2016.02.011","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T11:31:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-6351"],"journal":"Food & Chemical Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1455967869,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26891815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26891815","pubdate":"2016-02-20T22:01:42+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Potential role of autophagy in smokeless tobacco extract-induced cytotoxicity and in morin-induced protection in oral epithelial cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-role-autophagy-smokeless-tobacco-extractinduced-cytotoxicity-morininduced-protection-oral"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7216446,"mean":6.3565472342651,"rank":5432567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992922,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7216446,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283937,"mean":10.34810066353,"rank":198610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":45590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283937,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1857,"mean":7.2762036637931,"rank":1374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1857,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.2004571428571,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":2,"Environmental Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/statuses\/701006167829426176","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5779827],"posted_on":"2016-02-20T11:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
