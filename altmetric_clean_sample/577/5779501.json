Improvements in outcome for patients with advanced-stage disease are limited by intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance and by tumor heterogeneity at different anatomic sites and along disease progression. Molecules and cellular pathways mediating chemoresistance appear to be different for the different histological types of ovarian carcinoma, with most recent research focusing on serous and clear cell carcinoma. This review discusses recent data implicating various biomarkers in chemoresistance in this cancer, with focus on studies in which clinical specimens have been central.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073d4","authors":["Davidson, Ben","Ben Davidson"],"doi":"10.1586\/14737159.2016.1156532","endpage":"578","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T11:09:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-8352","1473-7159"],"issue":"5","journal":"Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics","last_mentioned_on":1471042449,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26895188?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26895188?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1586\/14737159.2016.1156532?ai=1pk53&mi=ianpxd&af=R","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1586\/14737159.2016.1156532?journalCode=iero20"],"pmid":"26895188","pubdate":"2016-02-20T22:00:15+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"569","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Recently identified drug resistance biomarkers in ovarian cancer","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recently-identified-drug-resistance-biomarkers-ovarian-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204367,"mean":6.945700472644,"rank":3400563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4759407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204367,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289829,"mean":10.697160329574,"rank":107465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":180058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289829,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":518,"mean":1.9846344294004,"rank":140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":518,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":2.4660606060606,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
