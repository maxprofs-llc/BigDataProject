In human cancer cells, tTG activates signaling pathways that promote cell growth and survival, whereas in other disorders (i.e. neurodegeneration), overexpression of tTG enhances cell death. Therefore, it is important to understand how tTG is differentially regulated and functioning to promote diametrically distinct cellular outcomes. Previous structural studies revealed that tTG adopts either a nucleotide-bound closed conformation, or a transamidation-competent open conformation. Here we provide evidence showing that these different conformational states determine whether tTG promotes, or is detrimental to, cell survival, with the open conformation of the protein being responsible for inducing cell death. First, we demonstrate that a nucleotide-binding-defective form of tTG, which has previously been shown to induce cell death, assumes an open conformation in solution as assessed by an enhanced sensitivity to trypsin digestion, and by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. We next identify two pairs of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds that, based on existing X-ray structures, are predicted to form between the most C-terminal \u03b2-barrel domain and the catalytic core domain of tTG. By disrupting these hydrogen bonds, we are able to generate forms of tTG that constitutively assume an open conformation and induce apoptosis. These findings provide important insights into how tTG participates in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly with regard to the actions of a C-terminal truncated form of tTG (TG-Short) that has been linked to such disorders and induces apoptosis by assuming an open-like conformation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Singh, Garima","Zhang, Jingwen","Ma, Yilun","Cerione, Richard A","Antonyak, Marc A"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m115.699108","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T11:23:24+00:00","funders":["niehs","nigms","nci"],"issns":["1083-351X"],"journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1455967330,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26893378?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26893378","pubdate":"2016-02-20T22:01:03+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"The Different Conformational States of Tissue Transglutaminase Have Opposing Affects on Cell Viability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/different-conformational-states-tissue-transglutaminase-opposing-affects-cell-viability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7216446,"mean":6.3565472342651,"rank":6223394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7216446,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283937,"mean":10.348072488166,"rank":238329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283937,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29856,"mean":3.149931066823,"rank":27927,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29856,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":679,"mean":4.9212625368732,"rank":607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":679,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
