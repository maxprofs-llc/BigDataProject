We determined whether early eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) treatment in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) reduces adverse cardiovascular events.\nThis prospective, open-label, blind end point-randomized trial consisted of 241 patients with ACS. Patients were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin (2mg\/day) with or without 1800mg\/day of EPA initiated within 24h after PCI. The primary endpoint was defined as cardiovascular events occurring within 1year, including death from a cardiovascular cause, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI and revascularization.\nThe mean EPA\/arachidonic acid ratio at follow-up was 0.40 in the control group and 1.15 in the EPA group. A primary endpoint event occurred in 11 patients (9.2%) in the EPA group and 24 patients (20.2%) in the control group (absolute risk reduction, 11.0%; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.87; P=0.02). Notably, death from a cardiovascular cause at 1year was significantly lower in the EPA group than in the control group (0.8% vs. 4.2%, P=0.04).\nEarly initiation of treatment with EPA combined with statin after successful primary PCI reduced cardiovascular events after ACS.\nUMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR); Registry Number, UMIN000016723; URL, http:\/\/www.umin.ac.jp\/ctr\/index-j.htm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b29","authors":["Kazumasa Nosaka","Toru Miyoshi","Mutsumi Iwamoto","Masahito Kajiya","Keisuke Okawa","Saori Tsukuda","Fumi Yokohama","Masahiro Sogo","Tomoyuki Nishibe","Naoaki Matsuo","Satoshi Hirohata","Hiroshi Ito","Masayuki Doi","Nosaka, Kazumasa","Miyoshi, Toru","Iwamoto, Mutsumi","Kajiya, Masahito","Okawa, Keisuke","Tsukuda, Saori","Yokohama, Fumi","Sogo, Masahiro","Nishibe, Tomoyuki","Matsuo, Naoaki","Hirohata, Satoshi","Ito, Hiroshi","Doi, Masayuki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijcard.2016.11.105","first_seen_on":"2016-11-13T19:46:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01675273","1874-1754"],"journal":"International Journal of Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1490104102,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S016752731633563X","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27865182","http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167-5273(16)33563-X\/fulltext?rss=yes","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internationaljournalofcardiology.com%2Farticle%2FS0167-5273%2816%2933563-X%2Ffulltext&code=ijca-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=4&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internationaljournalofcardiology.com%2Farticle%2FS0167-5273%2816%2933563-X%2Ffulltext&code=ijca-site","http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S0167-5273(16)33563-X\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com\/article\/S016752731633563X\/pdf","pmid":"27865182","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Early initiation of eicosapentaenoic acid and statin treatment is associated with better clinical outcomes than statin alone in patients with acute coronary syndromes: 1-year outcomes of a randomized controlled study","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S016752731633563X","volume":"228","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-initiation-eicosapentaenoic-acid-statin-treatment-associated-better-clinical-outcomes-statin-a-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.25,"score_history":{"1y":6.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":1364605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7021365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239086,"mean":13.121039847753,"rank":58161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":180721,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239086,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3847,"mean":3.1967888715549,"rank":339,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3847,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":3.8432335025381,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"NL":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JohnCappello\/statuses\/797888301084516352","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[13570736],"posted_on":"2016-11-13T19:46:09+00:00","author":{"name":"JohnCappello","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899602649527570432\/0Zq30X7r_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"JohnCappello","tweeter_id":"15785470","geo":{"lt":41.52787,"ln":-73.12761,"country":"US"},"followers":562},"tweet_id":"797888301084516352"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/tradejas\/statuses\/797932089018499073","license":"gnip","rt":["JohnCappello"],"citation_ids":[13570736],"posted_on":"2016-11-13T22:40:09+00:00","author":{"name":"trader j","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/543020964708360192\/MbS_W9i0_normal.jpeg","description":"You gotta know when to hold them..,know when to run!
