The objective of this study was to test if microRNA-30 (miR-30) family members are endogenous regulators of CaMKII\u03b4 expression following vascular injury and whether ectopic expression of miR-30 can inhibit CaMKII\u03b4-dependent VSM cell function and neointimal VSM hyperplasia induced by vascular injury. The CaMKII\u03b4 3'UTR contains a consensus miR-30 binding sequence that is highly conserved across species. A significant decrease in miR-30 family members and increase in CaMKII\u03b42 protein expression, with no change in CaMKII\u03b4 mRNA expression, was observed in medial layers of VSM 7 days post-injury. In vitro, overexpression of miR-30c or miR-30e inhibited CaMKII\u03b42 protein expression by ~50% in cultured rat aortic VSM cells, and inhibited VSM cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, lenti-viral delivery of miR-30c into injured rat carotid arteries prevented the injury-induced increase in CaMKII\u03b42. Furthermore, neointima formation was dramatically inhibited by lenti-viral delivery of miR-30c in the injured medial smooth muscle. These studies define a novel mechanism for regulating CaMKII\u03b4 expression in VSM and provide a new potential therapeutic strategy to reduce progression of vascular proliferative diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Liu, Yong Feng","Spinelli, Amy","Sun, Li-Yan","Jiang, Miao","Singer, Diane V","Ginnan, Roman","Saddouk, Fatima Z","Van Riper, Dee","Singer, Harold A","Yong Feng Liu","Amy Spinelli","Li-Yan Sun","Miao Jiang","Diane V.
