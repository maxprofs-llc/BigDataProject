In this study we investigated whether intense systemic LIF therapy prevents the loss of lumbar motoneurons in the transgenic SOD1 G93A mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Treatment involved daily 25 microg\/kg intraperitoneal injection for a period of 6 weeks starting at 70 days of age. Using the unbiased optical dissector technique, significant rescue of motoneurons in the LIF-treated group (3809+\/-455) was found compared to the vehicle group (1085+\/-140).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Azari, M F","Galle, A","Lopes, E C","Kurek, J","Cheema, S S"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0006-8993(01)03156-0","endpage":"147","first_seen_on":"2016-05-21T15:49:57+00:00","issns":["0006-8993","00068993"],"issue":"1","journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1490975100,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11730713"],"pmid":"11730713","pubdate":"2001-12-13T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"144","subjects":["brain"],"title":"Leukemia inhibitory factor by systemic administration rescues spinal motor neurons in the SOD1 G93A murine model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"922","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leukemia-inhibitory-factor-systemic-administration-rescues-spinal-motor-neurons-sod1-g93a-murine-mod-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440126,"mean":7.0979478654558,"rank":1122269,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":7293990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440126,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274034,"mean":11.688186605262,"rank":50456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":223069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274034,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3609,"mean":3.775183481153,"rank":322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":3278,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3609,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.9353448275862,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
