It has been purified about 2000-fold with a yield of over 12% from adult Sprague-Dawley male rat livers by an eight-step procedure. The final preparation was homogeneous on analytrical disc gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had activity toward p-nitrophenol with an approximately 1600-fold increase in specific activity over the crude homogenate, but it had almost no detectable activity toward steroids such as estrone, beta-estradiol, testosterone, dehydroisoandrosterone, and corticosterone. There was also very little sulfation activity toward serotonin and L-tyrosine methyl ester. The optimal pH for the enzyme activity is approximately 6.3 when measured in sodium phosphate buffer. Mg2+ at 6 to 9 mM could increase the enzyme activity up to 30%. Mn2+ activated the enzyme only slightly at very low concentrations. Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ were all strongly inhibitory, but Ca2+ had very little effect. Thiol compounds were found to have a stabilizing effect and thiol-blocking reagents were potent inhibitors for this enzyme. The pure enzyme was very unstable especially in diluet solutions. The isoelectric point (pl) of the enzyme is 5.66 +\/- 0.07. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was 68,000 +\/- 500 as estimated by Sephadex G-100 and G-200 gel filtrations. A single component with molecular weight of 38,250 +\/- 1,350 was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Comparison of the enzyme activity in mail and female rat livers at each stage of purification revealed that there was only a trace amount of N-OH-2-AAF sulfotransferase present in the female rat liver.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Wu, S G","Straub, K D"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-21T20:25:23+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"21","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1463862315,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10300"],"pmid":"10300","pubdate":"1976-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Purification and characterization of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene sulfotransferase from rat liver.","type":"article","volume":"251","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/behavioural-physiological-responses-na%C3%AFve-european-rabbits-predator-odour"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7724913,"mean":6.6254088328702,"rank":1882864,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4814884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7724913,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268778,"mean":11.474849633711,"rank":86113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":178934,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268778,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30656,"mean":3.1948630239765,"rank":3337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":11388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30656,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":489,"mean":5.5187131147541,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":489,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":13,"Researcher":45,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
