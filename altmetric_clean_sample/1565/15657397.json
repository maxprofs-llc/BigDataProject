Considering the randomness of solute movement in hydrogel network, a physical diffusion RMP-1 model based on obstruction theory was established in this study. Based on this, the physical properties of the solute and polymer chain and the interactions between them were introduced into this model, RMP-2 and RMP-3 model were established to understand and predict the diffusion behaviors of proteins in hydrogel. In addition, zwitterionic poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) hydrogels with wide range and fine adjustable mesh sizes were prepared and used as efficient experimental platforms for model validation. Flory characteristic ratios, Flory-Huggins parameter, mesh size and polymer chain radius of PSBMA hydrogels were determined. The diffusion coefficients of the proteins (albumin from bovine serum (BSA), Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Lysozyme) in PSBMA hydrogels were studied by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) technique. The measured diffusion coefficients were compared with the predictions of obstruction models and it was found that our model presented an excellent predictive ability. Furthermore, the assessment of our model revealed that protein diffusion in PSBMA hydrogel would be affected by the physical properties of the protein and PSBMA network. It was also confirmed that the diffusion behaviors of protein in zwitterionic hydrogel can be adjusted by changing the crosslinking density of the hydrogel and the ionic strength of the swelling medium. Our model will be expected to possess accurately predictive ability for the diffusion coefficient of solute in hydrogel, which will be widely used in the biomedical field.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec5","authors":["Yuhang Zhou","Junjie Li","Ying Zhang","Dianyu Dong","Ershuai Zhang","Feng Ji","Zhihui Qin","Jun Yang","Fanglian Yao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b10355","first_seen_on":"2017-01-22T05:24:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-6106","1520-5207"],"journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","last_mentioned_on":1485062480,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b10355"],"pmid":"28060509","pubdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Establishment of a Physical Model for Solute Diffusion in Hydrogel: Understanding the Diffusion of Proteins in Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) Hydrogel","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpcb.6b10355","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/establishment-physical-model-solute-diffusion-hydrogel-understanding-diffusion-proteins-polysulfobet"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088508,"mean":6.8823654995833,"rank":7002884,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260565,"mean":12.830577915598,"rank":215484,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260565,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3910,"mean":1.7578429265797,"rank":2544,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3910,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153,"mean":1.3861842105263,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
