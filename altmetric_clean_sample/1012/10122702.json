Great work by my old lab #mitocarecenter #ThomasJefferson @MolecularCell @MitoAging","Redox nano-domains are formed by and control Ca++ signalling at the ER-mitochondrial Interface (@MolecularCell)"],"citation":{"abstract":"The ER-mitochondrial interface is central to calcium signaling, organellar dynamics, and lipid biosynthesis. The ER and mitochondrial membranes also host sources and targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but their local dynamics and relevance remained elusive since measurement and perturbation of ROS at the organellar interface has proven difficult. Employing drug-inducible synthetic ER-mitochondrial linkers, we overcame this problem and demonstrate that the ER-mitochondrial interface hosts a nanodomain of H2O2, which is induced by cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] spikes and exerts a positive feedback on calcium oscillations. H2O2 nanodomains originate from the mitochondrial cristae, which are compressed upon calcium signal propagation to the mitochondria, likely due to Ca(2+)-induced K(+) and concomitant water influx to the matrix. Thus, ER-mitochondrial H2O2 nanodomains represent a component of inter-organelle communication, regulating calcium signaling and mitochondrial activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["David\u00a0M.
