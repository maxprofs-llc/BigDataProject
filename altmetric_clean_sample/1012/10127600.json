The primary aim of the study was to investigate effects of AT on cognitive test scores in the randomized Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial.\nChildren ages 5 to 9 years with OSAS without prolonged oxyhemoglobin desaturation were randomly assigned to watchful waiting with supportive care (n = 227) or early AT (eAT, n = 226). Neuropsychological tests were administered before the intervention and 7 months after the intervention. Mixed model analysis compared the groups on changes in test scores across follow-up, and regression analysis examined associations of these changes in the eAT group with changes in sleep measures.\nMean test scores were within the average range for both groups. Scores improved significantly (P < .05) more across follow-up for the eAT group than for the watchful waiting group. These differences were found only on measures of nonverbal reasoning, fine motor skills, and selective attention and had small effects sizes (Cohen's d, 0.20-0.24). As additional evidence for AT-related effects on scores, gains in test scores for the eAT group were associated with improvements in sleep measures.\nSmall and selective effects of AT were observed on cognitive tests in children with OSAS without prolonged desaturation. Relative to evidence from Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial for larger effects of surgery on sleep, behavior, and quality of life, AT may have limited benefits in reversing any cognitive effects of OSAS, or these benefits may require more extended follow-up to become manifest.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b7","authors":["Taylor, H Gerry","Bowen, Susan R","Beebe, Dean W","Hodges, Elise","Amin, Raouf","Arens, Raanan","Chervin, Ronald D","Garetz, Susan L","Katz, Eliot S","Moore, Rene\u00e9 H","Morales, Knashawn H","Muzumdar, Hiren","Paruthi, Shalini","Rosen, Carol L","Sadhwani, Anjali","Thomas, Nina Hattiangadi","Ware, Janice","Marcus, Carole L","Ellenberg, Susan S","Redline, Susan","Giordani, Bruno","H.
