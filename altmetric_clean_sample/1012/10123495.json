Fixed or random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results across studies.\nIn all, 35 studies were included in our analysis. Out of a total of 997 patients in these studies, epileptic patients receiving AEDs showed an overall significant decrease in thyroxin (T4) and free T4 (fT4) and higher levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) than the controls (T4: standardized mean difference [SMD]=-1.839, 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.063 to -1.614; fT4: SMD=-1.190, 95% CI, -1.687 to -0.692; TSH: SMD=0.445, 95% CI, 0.031-0.858). Notably, the use of carbamazepine (CBZ) suggested a significant decrease in triiodothyronine (T3), T4, and fT4; phenytoin (PHT) use showed a decrease in T4 and fT4; and valproic acid (VPA) use was associated with decreased T4 and increased TSH.\nOur study suggests that use of AEDs such as CBZ, PHT, and VPA, was associated with alteration of thyroid hormones among patients with epilepsy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088e0","authors":["Yin-Xi Zhang","Chun-Hong Shen","Qi-Lun Lai","Gao-Li Fang","Wen-Jie Ming","Ru-Yi Lu","Mei-Ping Ding"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.seizure.2016.01.010","endpage":"79","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T22:25:55+00:00","issns":["1532-2688"],"journal":"Seizure","last_mentioned_on":1469004244,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.seizure-journal.com\/article\/S1059-1311(16)00022-4\/abstract?rss%3Dyes&rc=0&code=yseiz-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.seizure-journal.com\/article\/S1059131116000224\/pdf","pmid":"26803280","pubdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"72","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Effects of antiepileptic drug on thyroid hormones in patients with epilepsy: A meta-analysis","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-antiepileptic-drug-thyroid-hormones-patients-epilepsy-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8147915,"mean":6.9024628625127,"rank":4316002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2261665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8147915,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257659,"mean":12.01971027486,"rank":141459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90477,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257659,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":902,"mean":3.2823662597114,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":310,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":902,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.4364705882353,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
