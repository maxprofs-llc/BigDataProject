Clinical studies thus far have failed to identify an effective treatment strategy when a combination of targets controlling aspects of neuroprotection, neuroinflammation, and neuroregeneration is needed. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) offer the advantage of this approach. Although further clinical trial research is needed, there is a growing body of strong preclinical evidence and clinical experience that suggests that benefits may be possible from aggressively adding substantial amounts of n-3FA to optimize the nutritional foundation of TBI, concussion, and postconcussion syndrome patients. Early and optimal doses of n-3FA, even in a prophylactic setting, have the potential to improve outcomes from this potentially devastating problem. With evidence of unsurpassed safety and tolerability, n-3FA should be considered mainstream, conventional medicine, if conventional medicine can overcome its inherent bias against nutritional, nonpharmacologic therapies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e94","authors":["Michael D.
