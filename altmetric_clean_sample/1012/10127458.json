A total of 144 patients with AF and 144 age- and sex-matched patients with small vessel occlusion but without AF were included.\nPatients with AF had significantly lower peak systolic velocity (PSV), mean velocity, flow volume (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and end-diastolic velocity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035) of the internal carotid artery (ICA); significantly lower cerebral blood flow (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and lower flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than patients with small vessel occlusion but without AF. In patients with AF, there was an inverse linear correlation between ICA end-diastolic velocity, mean velocity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), flow volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), middle cerebral artery flow velocities (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and age. Cardiac ejection fraction had a positive linear correlation with ICA PSV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) but an inverse correlation with the heart rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). There was a significant decline in PSV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), resistance index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and flow volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0121) of the ICA as well as cerebral blood flow (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) as the heart rate increased.\nCerebral blood flow is markedly reduced in ischemic stroke patients with AF as compared with that in patients with small vessel disease but without AF.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c90","authors":["Yu-Chin Su","Siew-Na Lim","Fu-Yi Yang","Shinn-Kuang Lin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jfma.2016.05.009","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T05:14:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0929-6646"],"journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","last_mentioned_on":1468442404,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.jfma-online.com\/article\/S0929-6646(16)30119-X\/abstract&rc=0&code=jfma-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jfma-online.com\/article\/S092966461630119X\/pdf","pmid":"27401697","pubdate":"2016-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Evaluation of cerebral blood flow in acute ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation: A sonographic study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-cerebral-blood-flow-acute-ischemic-stroke-patients-atrial-fibrillation-sonographic-study-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072037,"mean":6.8520742736971,"rank":3330914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4697619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072037,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257060,"mean":11.932129402199,"rank":96538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":158293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257060,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":256,"mean":2.5031843137255,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":256,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":5.2333333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/sas_freeman\/statuses\/753328160851320833","license":"gnip","rt":["signagnststroke"],"citation_ids":[10127458],"posted_on":"2016-07-13T20:40:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Sas Freeman","url":"http:\/\/www.sasfreeman.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/827513020880297985\/7n5Tpjdg_normal.jpg","description":"Stroke survivor,speaker, mentor -artist - author Voice Over Artist.
