Inhibition of mTOR on dendritic cells (DC) can influence cellular immune response and the survival of DC. RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization in infants and is a high priority candidate to vaccine development. In this study we showed that rapamycin treatment on RSV-infected murine bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) decreases the frequency of CD8(+)CD44(high) T cells. However, inhibition of mTOR on RSV-infected BMDC did not modify the activation phenotype of these cells. RSV-RNA levels increase when infected BMDC were treated with rapamycin. Moreover, we observed that rapamycin diminishes apoptosis cell death of RSV-infected BMDC co-culture with T cells and this effect was abolished when the cells were co-cultured in a transwell system that prevents cell-to-cell contact or migration. Taken together, these data indicate that rapamycin treatment present a toxic effect on RSV-infected BMDC increasing RSV-RNA levels, affecting partially CD8 T cell differentiation and also increasing BMDC survival in a mechanism dependent on T cell contact.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367c","authors":["do Nascimento de Freitas, Deise","Gassen, Rodrigo Benedetti","Fazolo, Tiago","de Souza, Ana Paula Duarte","Deise do Nascimento de Freitas","Rodrigo Benedetti Gassen","Tiago Fazolo","Ana Paula Duarte de Souza"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tiv.2016.07.016","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T07:56:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3177","08872333"],"journal":"Toxicology in Vitro","last_mentioned_on":1490682425,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27466155?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27466155?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27466155","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Rapamycin increases RSV RNA levels and survival of RSV-infected dendritic cell depending on T cell contact","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S088723331630145X","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rapamycin-increases-rsv-rna-levels-survival-rsvinfected-dendritic-cell-depending-t-cell-contact"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8425604,"mean":7.0878923279354,"rank":4499981,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2346554,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8425604,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260501,"mean":12.014728783109,"rank":141920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260501,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":727,"mean":3.8477079889807,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":727,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.8260714285714,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
