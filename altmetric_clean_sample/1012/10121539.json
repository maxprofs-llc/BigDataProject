Subjects were divided into three groups according to anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment; group 1 (infliximab, 66), group 2 (adalimumab, 45), and group 3 (etanercept, 32).\nMean age was 41.0 \u00b1 13.0 years, and 97 patients (67.8%) were male. Mean follow-up period was 70.6 \u00b1 37.9 months. In cases of active ocular inflammation at the onset of anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment, patients showed improved activity of uveitis after 24.0 \u00b1 15.0 days (group 1), 17.9 \u00b1 6.0 days (group 2), and 25.9 \u00b1 18.0 days (group 3). After the anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment, 71 of 94 patients (32 [76.2%] in group 1, 26 [78.8%] in group 2, and 13 [68.4%] in group 3) remained without uveitis relapse. A reduction in the number of systemic medications was achieved in 129 (90.2%) patients. 28 cases of minor side effects were observed, and 4 cases were tuberculosis leading to discontinuation of anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment.\nInfliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept were effective for treating and reducing the number of uveitis relapse in HLA-B27 positive AS. However, the risk of serious infections was noted, so ophthalmologists should consider the possibility that prolonged use of biologic agents may result in systemic side effects.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Mirinae Kim","Jae-Yon Won","Seung Yong Choi","Ji Hyeon Ju","Young-Hoon Park","Kim, Mirinae","Won, Jae-Yon","Choi, Seung Yong","Ju, Ji Hyeon","Park, Young-Hoon"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajo.2016.07.016","endpage":"40","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T19:06:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1891","00029394"],"journal":"American Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1475656302,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30360-9\/abstract?rss%3Dyes%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed&rc=0&code=ajopht-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30360-9\/abstract?rss%3Dyes%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&rc=0&code=ajopht-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30360-9\/abstract?rss%3Dyes&rc=0&code=ajopht-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30360-9\/fulltext&rc=0&code=ajopht-site","http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002-9394(16)30360-9\/fulltext?elsca1=etoc&amp;elsca2=email&amp;elsca3=0002-9394_201610_170__&amp;elsca4=Ophthalmology"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajo.com\/article\/S0002939416303609\/pdf","pmid":"27470062","pubdate":"2016-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"32","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment for HLA-B27 positive ankylosing spondylitis-related uveitis","type":"article","volume":"170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antitnf%CE%B1-treatment-hlab27positive-ankylosing-spondylitisrelated-uveitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7483631,"mean":6.488280441707,"rank":3639879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3654704,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7483631,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250780,"mean":11.817586153545,"rank":126646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250780,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2159,"mean":2.4173197405005,"rank":1100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":961,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2159,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":2.6542452830189,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
