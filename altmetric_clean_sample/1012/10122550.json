It is a more radical approach than conventional abdominoperineal excision (APE) with potentially better oncological outcome. The aim of this study was to analyse short term results of ELAPE compared with conventional abdominoperineal excision.\nData were collected prospectively for 72 patients who underwent abdominoperineal excision (APE) for low rectal carcinomas from 2010 to 2014. Of these 24 patients underwent ELAPE with biological prosthetic mesh used to close the perineal defect.\nThe median age of patients was 68 (37-87). Positive circumferential resection margin (1\/24 vs. 8\/48) and Intra operative perorations (0\/24 vs. 6\/48) compared favourably with ELAPE.\nShort term results from this study support that ELAPE has better oncological outcome.","altmetric_jid":"537f30852a83eeb45a8b4573","authors":["Zulfiqar Hanif","Alison Bradley","Ahmed Hammad","Arijit Mukherjee"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amsu.2016.07.016","endpage":"35","first_seen_on":"2016-07-29T20:42:55+00:00","issns":["2049-0801","20490801"],"journal":"Annals of Medicine and Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1484601123,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.annalsjournal.com\/article\/S2049-0801(16)30093-0\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes%26utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&rc=0&code=amsu-site","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4971229\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annalsjournal.com\/article\/S2049080116300930\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC4971229","pmid":"27508080","pubdate":"2016-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"32","title":"Extralevator Abdominoperineal Excision (Elape): A Retrospective Cohort Study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extralevator-abdominoperineal-excision-elape-retrospective-cohort-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":2.6,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8076231,"mean":6.8570644748779,"rank":3239478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4812100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8076231,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257045,"mean":11.977852367687,"rank":92447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":163127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257045,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":291,"mean":1.5240689655172,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":291,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"IT":1},"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnnalsJournal\/statuses\/756261725041594368","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10122550],"posted_on":"2016-07-21T22:57:00+00:00","author":{"name":"AMS","url":"http:\/\/www.annalsjournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/681633637293539329\/dssBNnTs_normal.png","description":"Annals of Medicine and Surgery - peer-reviewed, open access journal with particular focus on trainee physicians, surgeons and students.","id_on_source":"AnnalsJournal","tweeter_id":"703999754","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":166},"tweet_id":"756261725041594368"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GGarulli\/statuses\/820947704054431744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10122550],"posted_on":"2017-01-16T10:55:59+00:00","author":{"name":"gianluca garulli","url":"http:\/\/www.gianlucagarulli.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/591529195068612608\/iYtWsFPq_normal.jpg","description":"#Head of Dept. of #GeneralSurgery #surgery, #advancedLaparoscopicSurgery #Laparoscopicsurgery and #sailing lover","id_on_source":"GGarulli","tweeter_id":"1369438861","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":526},"tweet_id":"820947704054431744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ManishChandSurg\/statuses\/820947922497994752","license":"gnip","rt":["GGarulli"],"citation_ids":[10122550],"posted_on":"2017-01-16T10:56:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Manish Chand","url":"https:\/\/www.uclh.nhs.uk\/OurServices\/Consultants\/Pages\/MrManishChand.aspx","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/889201299815882754\/D9e5tyrr_normal.jpg","description":"Consultant Colorectal Surgeon & Senior Lecturer & Director of MS degree in Advanced MIS @ University College London;
