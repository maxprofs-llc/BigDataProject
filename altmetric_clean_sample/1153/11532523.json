Body mass index and waist circumference are not good surrogates for obesity.\nTo evaluate whether periprostatic fat volume and periprostatic fat ratio as determined by multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging correlates with the presence of high-grade prostate cancer.\nA total of 295 consecutive patients (Median age 64, range 38-84) underwent mpMRI of the prostate gland between August 2013 and February 2015. All patients underwent a 3 Tesla multi-parametric MRI. Using DynaCAD (Invivo, Gainesville Florida, USA), we calculated the prostate volume and volume of the periprostatic fat seen on mpMRI. The peri-prostatic fat ratio was calculated using the formula peri-prostatic fat volume \/ prostate volume).\nA higher periprostatic fat volume (p<0.001) and a higher periprostatic fat ratio (p<0.001) were significantly associated with a higher Gleason Score. Periprostatic fat ratio is a better predictor of higher Gleason Score compare to periprostatic fat volume (p<0.001). There was no correlation observed between periprostatic fat ratio and PSA (Median 7.34, range 0.36-59.7, p=0.274), age (Median 64, range 38-84, p=0.665) or BMI (Median 28.33, range 17.99-45.44, p=0.310). Patients with a higher periprostatic fat ratio were more likely to undergo intervention for prostate cancer.\nA higher periprostatic fat ratio is significantly associated with a higher Gleason Score. Periprostatic fat ratio is a better predictor of higher Gleason Score compare to periprostatic fat volume and may be an important risk factor in diagnosing patients higher grade prostate cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Wei Phin Tan","Carol Lin","Meri Chen","Leslie Deane","Tan, Wei Phin","Lin, Carol","Chen, Meri","Deane, Leslie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2016.07.042","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T04:26:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1527-9995","00904295"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1474657520,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(16)30551-9\/fulltext?rss%3Dyes&rc=0&code=url-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(16)30551-9\/fulltext&rc=0&code=url-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0090429516305519"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429516305519\/pdf","pmid":"27592523","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Periprostatic Fat: A Risk Factor for Prostate Cancer?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/periprostatic-fat-risk-factor-prostate-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8422812,"mean":7.0866213065837,"rank":1342889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":7076103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8422812,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252901,"mean":12.502265543693,"rank":58166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":194516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252901,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3325,"mean":4.236421179302,"rank":371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3325,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196,"mean":6.3775282051282,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":3,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
