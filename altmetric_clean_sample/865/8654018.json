Data were analyzed using Pearson's \u03c7(2) and Student's t-test.\n\u2002 The prevalence of dehiscences at the maxillary central incisors, lateral incisors, and canines teeth were 43.2%, 70.6%, and 34.1% on the cleft side and 22.7%, 53.1%, and 27.3% on the noncleft side of UCLP patients, and 13.7%, 7.8%, and 13.7% in controls, respectively (statistically no difference between the sides of cleft patients). The cleft patients had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of dehiscences than did the controls on both the cleft and noncleft sides (P < .05), except for the maxillary central incisors. Fenestrations for these teeth were significantly more common on the cleft side in UCLP patients compared with controls (P < .05), whereas the difference for maxillary lateral incisors was not statistically significant.\n\u2002 Patients with UCLP showed a higher prevalence of dehiscence and fenestration defects around the maxillary anterior teeth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f1b","authors":["Suleyman Kutalmis Buyuk"],"doi":"10.2319\/042715-289.1","endpage":"436","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T02:40:25+00:00","issns":["1945-7103","0003-3219"],"issue":"3","journal":"Angle Orthodontist","last_mentioned_on":1465425000,"links":["http:\/\/www.angle.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.2319\/042715-289.1"],"pmid":"26284755","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"431","subjects":["dentistry","orthodontics"],"title":"\n              Evaluation of dehiscence and fenestration in adolescent patients affected by unilateral cleft lip and palate:\n              A retrospective cone beam computed tomography study\n            ","type":"article","volume":"86","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-dehiscence-fenestration-adolescent-patients-affected-unilateral-cleft-lip-palate-retrospe-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":6816419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267895,"mean":11.412119480092,"rank":223351,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267895,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":324,"mean":2.5691021671827,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":324,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.2058823529412,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"www.angle.org","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1034157063306332&id=331069220281790","license":"public","citation_ids":[8654018],"posted_on":"2016-06-08T22:30:00+00:00","summary":"Art\u00edculo de inter\u00e9s para nuestros colegas cirujanos y ortodoncistas: \nEvaluation of dehiscence and fenestration in adolescent patients affected by unilateral cleft lip and palate:\nA retrospective cone beam computed tomography study\n\u00a1Disponible en PDF!\nhttp","author":{"name":"IMAX Rx 3D","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/331069220281790","facebook_wall_name":"IMAX Rx 3D","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/331069220281790\/picture","id_on_source":"331069220281790"}}]}}
