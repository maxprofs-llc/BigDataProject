In total, 3555 questionnaires were completed of which 1 000 were included in this study. The women's responses to the open ended question: \"Is there something you want to communicate to health care professionals who take care of women with decreased fetal movement or to women who experience decreased fetal movements?\", were analysed with manifest content analysis.\nthree categories were revealed about requests to health care professionals: Pay attention to the woman and take her seriously, Rapid and adequate care and Improved information on fetal movements. Regarding what the women want to communicate to other pregnant women, four categories were revealed: Contact health care for check-up, Pay attention to fetal movement, Recommended source of information and Practical advice.\npregnant women who consult health care due to decreased fetal movements want to be taken seriously and receive rapid and adequate care with the health of the infant as the primary priority. The women requested uniform information about decreased fetal movements. They wished to convey to others in the same situation the importance of consulting care once too often rather than one time too few.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b3b","authors":["Susanne Georgsson","Anders Linde","Karin Pettersson","Rebecca Nilsson","Ingela R\u00e5destad"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.midw.2016.06.006","first_seen_on":"2016-06-11T01:38:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-3099","02666138"],"journal":"Midwifery","last_mentioned_on":1471729278,"links":["http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(16)30096-1\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=arizonamidwife&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(16)30096-1\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_source=birthpros.com&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(16)30096-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138%2816%2930096-1\/abstract","http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(16)30096-1\/abstract#.V2NTtLMWkXg.twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0266613816300961","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266-6138(16)30096-1\/abstract&rc=0&code=ymidw-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.midwiferyjournal.com\/article\/S0266613816300961\/pdf","pmid":"27428105","pubdate":"2016-06-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"To be taken seriously and receive rapid and adequate care - womens\u2019 requests when they consult health care for reduced fetal movements","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/taken-seriously-receive-rapid-adequate-care-womens-requests-consult-health-care-reduced-fetal-moveme"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18.3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8250529,"mean":6.9707556030289,"rank":466031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7784064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8250529,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270892,"mean":11.575931647784,"rank":23586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":247280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270892,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":925,"mean":6.0950909090909,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":925,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":11.351818181818,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":4,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":12,"Scientists":5,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
