We measured the interaction force at a ligation point and clarified the features of the force pattern among surgeons with different skill levels during laparoscopic knot tying.\nForty-four surgeons were divided into three groups based on experience: 13 novice (0-5 years), 16 intermediate (6-15 years), and 15 expert (16-30 years). To assess the tractive force direction and volume during knot tying, we used a sensor that measures six force-torque values (x-axis: Fx, y-axis: Fy, z-axis: Fz, and xy-axis: Fxy) attached to a slit Penrose drain. All participants completed one double knot and five single knot sequences. We recorded completion time, force volume (FV), maximum force (MF), time over 1.5\u00a0N, duration of non-zero force, and percentage time when vertical force exceeded horizontal force (PTz).\nThere was a significant difference between groups for completion time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007); FV (total: p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; Fx: p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, Fy: p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, Fxy: p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, Fz: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Fxy\/Fz: p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), MF (total: p\u00a0=\u00a00.004; Fx: p\u00a0=\u00a00.015, Fy: p\u00a0=\u00a00.035, Fxy: p\u00a0=\u00a00.009, Fz: p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, Fxy\/Fz: p\u00a0=\u00a00.041); time over 1.5\u00a0N (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002); duration of non-zero force (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029); and PTz (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). PTz showed the only significant difference comparing intermediates with experts (intermediates: 13.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0, experts: 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\nWe clarified the characteristics of the force pattern at the ligation point during suturing by surgeons with three levels of experience using a force measurement system. We revealed that both force volume and force direction differed depending on surgeons' skill level during knot tying.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221f","authors":["Takayasu, Kenta","Yoshida, Kenji","Kinoshita, Hidefumi","Yoshimoto, Syunsuke","Oshiro, Osamu","Matsuda, Tadashi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjsurg.2017.07.009","first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T13:09:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0002-9610","1879-1883"],"journal":"American Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1501236139,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28747252?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28747252","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Analysis of the tractive force pattern on a knot by force measurement during laparoscopic knot tying","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8286032,"mean":6.9859461464656,"rank":7165349,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8286032,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170476,"mean":11.556013479982,"rank":139273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170476,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2153,"mean":3.2835204460967,"rank":1693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2153,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":2.43108,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/miurologa\/statuses\/890875055143501825","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22929651],"posted_on":"2017-07-28T10:02:19+00:00","author":{"name":"Dra Solano Mendoza","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/804995165207281664\/xhvB4TR2_normal.jpg","description":"Especialista en Urolog\u00eda | Inter\u00e9s en Endourolog\u00eda y procedimientos de minima invasi\u00f3n |  Consultas 3262727 Opc.3-Opc.111 #Urolog\u00eda #Urology #Endourology","id_on_source":"miurologa","tweeter_id":"804992912962547712","geo":{"lt":6.25184,"ln":-75.56359,"country":"CO"},"followers":27},"tweet_id":"890875055143501825"}]}}
