However, productivity and titer of current recombinant strains still do not meet the requirements of industrial processes. Genetically encoded biosensors have been applied for high-throughput screening or dynamic regulation of biosynthetic pathways for enhancing the performance of microbial strains that produce valuable chemicals. Currently, few protein sensor-regulators for flavonoids exist. Unlike the protein-based trans-regulating controllers, riboswitches can respond to their ligands faster and eliminate off-target effects. Here, we developed artificial riboswitches that activate gene expression in response to naringenin, an important flavonoid. RNA aptamers for naringenin were developed using SELEX and cloned upstream of a dual selectable marker gene to construct a riboswitch library. Two in vivo selection routes were applied separately to the library by supplementing naringenin at two different concentrations during enrichments to modulate the operational ranges of the riboswitches. The selected riboswitches were responsive to naringenin and activated gene expression up to 2.91 fold. Operational ranges of the riboswitches were distinguished based on their selection route. Additionally, the specificity of the riboswitches was assessed, and their applicability as dynamic regulators was confirmed. Collectively, the naringenin riboswitches reported in this work will be valuable tools in metabolic engineering of microorganisms for the production of flavonoids.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006817","authors":["Jang, Sungho","Jang, Sungyeon","Xiu, Yu","Kang, Taek Jin","Lee, Sang-Hyeup","Koffas, Mattheos A.G.","Jung, Gyoo Yeol","Sungho Jang","Sungyeon Jang","Yu Xiu","Taek Jin Kang","Sang-Hyeup Lee","Mattheos A.
