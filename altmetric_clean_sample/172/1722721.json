Science.alltop"],"citation":{"abstract":"Honey storage initiates melanoidin formation that involves a cascade of seemingly unguided redox reactions between amino acids\/proteins, reducing sugars and polyphenols. In the process, high molecular weight protein-polyphenol complexes are formed, but the mechanism involved remains unknown. The objective of this study was twofold: to determine quantitative and qualitative changes in proteins in honeys stored for prolonged times and in different temperatures and to relate these changes to the formation of protein-polyphenol complexes. Six -month storage decreased the protein content by 46.7% in all tested honeys (t-test, p<0.002) with the rapid reduction occurring during the first three month. The changes in protein levels coincided with alterations in molecular size and net charge of proteins on SDS -PAGE. Electro-blotted proteins reacted with a quinone-specific nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) on nitrocellulose membranes indicating that quinones derived from oxidized polyphenols formed covalent bonds with proteins. Protein-polyphenol complexes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography differed in size and stoichiometry and fall into two categories: (a) high molecular weight complexes (230-180 kDa) enriched in proteins but possessing a limited reducing activity toward the NBT and (b) lower molecular size complexes (110-85 kDa) enriched in polyphenols but strongly reducing the dye. The variable stoichiometry suggest that the large, \"protein-type\" complexes were formed by protein cross-linking, while in the smaller, \"polyphenol-type\" complexes polyphenols were first polymerized prior to protein binding. Quinones preferentially bound a 31 kDa protein which, by the electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Qtof-MS) analysis, showed homology to dirigent-like proteins known for assisting in radical coupling and polymerization of phenolic compounds. These findings provide a new look on protein-polyphenol interaction in honey where the reaction of quinones with proteins and polyphenols could possibly be under assumed guidance of dirigent proteins.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Katrina Brudzynski","Calvin Sjaarda","Liset Maldonado-Alvarez"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0072897","first_seen_on":"2013-09-01T07:18:26+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1378019899,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0072897"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0072897.pdf","pmid":"24023654","pubdate":"2013-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e72897","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"A New Look on Protein-Polyphenol Complexation during Honey Storage: Is This a Random or Organized Event with the Help of Dirigent-Like Proteins?","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-look-proteinpolyphenol-complexation-during-honey-storage-random-organized-event-help-dirigentlik"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3558532,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93805,"mean":7.7315185706368,"rank":74989,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":652,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93805,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80037,"mean":8.3320977809987,"rank":64488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80037,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3847,"mean":11.429561102444,"rank":3177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3847,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
