Several models were proposed, but there is no consensus. Worse still, some data indicate that the SF organization previously revealed by optical imaging techniques simply reflects non-stimulus-specific responses. Instead, stimulus-specific responses arise from the homogeneous distribution of geniculo-cortical afferents representing X and Y pathways. To clarify this, we developed a new imaging method allowing rapid stimulation with a wide range of SFs covering more than 6 octaves with only 0.2 octave resolution. A benefit of this method is to avoid error of high-pass filtering methods which systematically under-represent dominant selectivity features near pinwheel centers. We show unequivocally that SF is organized into maps in cat area 17 (A17) and area 18 (A18). The SF organization in each area displays a global anteroposterior SF gradient and local patches. Its layout is constrained to that of the orientation map, and it is suggested that both maps share a common functional architecture. A17 and A18 are bound at the transition zone by another SF gradient involving the geniculo-cortical and the callosal pathways. A model based on principal component analysis shows that SF maps integrate three different SF-dependent channels. Two of these reflect the segregated excitatory input from X and Y geniculate cells to A17 and A18. The third one conveys a specific combination of excitatory and suppressive inputs to the visual cortex. In a manner coherent with anatomical and electrophysiological data, it is interpreted as originating from a subtype of Y geniculate cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["J\u00e9r\u00f4me Ribot","Yonane Aushana","Emmanuel Bui-Quoc","Chantal Milleret"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.4040-12.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-09-01T23:01:47+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"33","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1378148417,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/33\/13326.short?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/33\/13326.full.pdf","pmid":"23946391","pubdate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"13326","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Organization and Origin of Spatial Frequency Maps in Cat Visual Cortex","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/organization-origin-spatial-frequency-maps-cat-visual-cortex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2305224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1593163,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":35},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93805,"mean":7.7315031128738,"rank":47055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":32259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93805,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10243,"mean":6.6512216363992,"rank":5783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10243,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":335,"mean":15.072748502994,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":80,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":335,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
