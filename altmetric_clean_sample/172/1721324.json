AKR1C3 converts weaker 17-keto androgenic precursors to more potent 17-hydroxy androgens and is consistently the major upregulated gene in CRPC. The studies in the manuscript were undertaken to examine the role of AKR1C3 in AR function and CRPC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006efa","authors":["Muralimohan Yepuru","Zhongzhi Wu","Anand Kulkarni","Feng Yin","Christina M.
