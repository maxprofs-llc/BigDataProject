However, I show that the visual perception of faces is systematically biased by adaptation to a haptically explored face. Recently, face aftereffects (FAEs; the altered perception of faces after adaptation to a face) have been demonstrated not only in visual perception but also in haptic perception; therefore, I combined the two FAEs to examine whether the visual system receives face-related signals from the haptic modality. I found that adaptation to a haptically explored facial expression on a face mask produced a visual FAE for facial expression. This cross-modal FAE was not due to explicitly imaging a face, response bias, or adaptation to local features. Furthermore, FAEs transferred from vision to haptics. These results indicate that visual face processing depends on substrates adapted by haptic faces, which suggests that face processing relies on shared representation underlying cross-modal interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033de","authors":["Kazumichi Matsumiya","Matsumiya K"],"doi":"10.1177\/0956797613486981","endpage":"2098","first_seen_on":"2013-09-04T01:54:57+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1467-9280","0956-7976"],"issue":"10","journal":"Psychological Science (Sage Publications Inc.)","last_mentioned_on":1499827197,"links":["http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981.abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/0956797613486981","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24002886","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/24\/10\/2088.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/m.pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981.abstract","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981.full","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981","http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981.abstract?rss=1","http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/0956797613486981"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pss.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/08\/30\/0956797613486981.full.pdf","pmid":"24002886","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"SAGE PublicationsSage CA: Los Angeles, CA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2088","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Seeing a Haptically Explored Face Visual Facial-Expression Aftereffect From Haptic Adaptation to a Face","type":"article","volume":"24","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seeing-haptically-explored-face-visual-facialexpression-aftereffect-haptic-adaptation-face"},"altmetric_score":{"score":47.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":47.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":189400,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8011280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132976,"mean":7.1526557623615,"rank":3711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":129257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132976,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3130,"mean":50.32837711729,"rank":808,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3130,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":75.976461538462,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
