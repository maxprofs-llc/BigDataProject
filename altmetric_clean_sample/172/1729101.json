The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of Internet addiction (IA) with impulsivity and severity of psychopathology among Turkish university students. We also wanted to control the effect of impulsivity dimensions on the relationship between IA and psychopathology. A total of 319 university students from two universities in Ankara participated to the study. Students were assessed through the Internet Addiction Scale (IAS), the Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). Correlational analyses revealed that severity of IA was related to both SCL-90-R and BIS-11 scores. Among SCL-90-R subscales, severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) was the only predictor for IAS score. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that interpersonal sensitivity, additional to attentional and motor impulsiveness, was the predictor of IAS score. Although severity of IA is associated with wide range of psychopathology, particularly OCS, interpersonal sensitivity seems to be the main dimension that predict severity of IAS additional to impulsiveness (attentional and motor). Impulsivity seems to be an important construct when considering IA and its treatment among Turkish university students.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Dalbudak E","Evren C","Topcu M","Aldemir S","Coskun KS","Bozkurt M","Evren B","Canbal M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.psychres.2013.08.014","first_seen_on":"2013-09-04T12:04:59+00:00","issns":["1872-7123"],"journal":"Psychiatry Research","last_mentioned_on":1438760828,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23998359?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23998359?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23998359","pubdate":"2013-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Relationship of Internet addiction with impulsivity and severity of psychopathology among Turkish university students.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/relationship-internet-addiction-impulsivity-severity-psychopathology-among-turkish-university-studen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5446629,"mean":6.3432151099742,"rank":2008181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":3411942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5446629,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101434,"mean":7.9710215610305,"rank":31211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":69585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101434,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2964,"mean":3.8289821127236,"rank":794,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":2156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2964,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146,"mean":3.1439586206897,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
