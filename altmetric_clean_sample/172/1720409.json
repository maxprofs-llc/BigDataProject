Silver complexes 1-3 are active against the ovarian and breast cancer cell lines. A preliminary in vivo study shows 1 to be active against ovarian cancer in mice. The results obtained in these studies warrant further investigation of these compounds in vivo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041fe","authors":["Medvetz DA","Hindi KM","Panzner MJ","Ditto AJ","Yun YH","Youngs WJ"],"doi":"10.1155\/2008\/384010","first_seen_on":"2013-08-30T12:58:05+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Metal-Based Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1377851640,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18615197"],"pmid":"18615197","pubdate":"2007-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Anticancer Activity of Ag(I) N-Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes Derived from 4,5-Dichloro-1H-Imidazole.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticancer-activity-agi-nheterocyclic-carbene-complexes-derived-45dichloro1himidazole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.024,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.024},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8030429,"mean":6.8073822324252,"rank":793693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7236358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8030429,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131768,"mean":7.0941618614677,"rank":14168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":117594,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131768,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.7944444444444,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
