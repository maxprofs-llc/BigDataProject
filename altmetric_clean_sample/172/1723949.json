Our comparison of microRNA quantification by ddPCR and real-time PCR revealed greater precision (coefficients of variation decreased 37-86%) and improved day-to-day reproducibility (by a factor of seven) of ddPCR but with comparable sensitivity. When we applied ddPCR to serum microRNA biomarker analysis, this translated to superior diagnostic performance for identifying individuals with cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000426c","authors":["Christopher M Hindson","John R Chevillet","Hilary A Briggs","Emily N Gallichotte","Ingrid K Ruf","Benjamin J Hindson","Robert L Vessella","Muneesh Tewari","Hindson CM","Chevillet JR","Briggs HA","Gallichotte EN","Ruf IK","Hindson BJ","Vessella RL","Tewari M"],"doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.2633","endpage":"","first_seen_on":"2013-09-02T08:39:09+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["1548-7091","1548-7105"],"journal":"Nature Methods","last_mentioned_on":1429365174,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nmeth.2633.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nmeth.2633.htmlhttp:\/\/www.nature.com\/nmeth\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nmeth.2633.html"],"pmid":"23995387","pubdate":"2013-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Gene expression","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Gene expression analysis","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"","subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Absolute quantification by droplet digital PCR versus analog real-time PCR","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/absolute-quantification-droplet-digital-pcr-versus-analog-realtime-pcr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":76.494,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":76.494},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8026154,"mean":6.7980114505628,"rank":108274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":7918197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8026154,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132307,"mean":7.0546640968665,"rank":2027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":130280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132307,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2792,"mean":20.536470082408,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2606,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2792,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":25.8755,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":6,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":21,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":132,"Student  > Doctoral Student":24,"Student  > Ph.
