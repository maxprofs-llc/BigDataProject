Evidence has shown that MK-801 increases the probability of operant responding during extinction, possibly modeling perseveration, as would be seen in patients with schizophrenia. This MK-801-induced behavioral perseveration is reversed by dopamine receptor antagonism. To further explore the role of dopamine in this behavioral change, the current study sought to determine if the MK-801-induced increase in non-rewarded operant responding could be mimicked by dopamine agonism and determine how it was related to locomotor activity. Male Long Evans rats were treated systemically with MK-801, cocaine, GBR12909 or apomorphine (APO) and given a single trial operant extinction session, followed by a separate assessment of locomotor activity. Both MK-801 (0.05 mg\/kg) and cocaine (10 mg\/kg) significantly increased responding during the extinction session and both increased horizontal locomotor activity. No dose of GBR-12909 (5, 10 or 20 mg\/kg) was found to effect non-rewarded operant responding or locomotor activity. APO (0.05, 0.5, 2 or 5 mg\/kg) treatment produced a dose-dependent decrease in both operant responding and locomotor activity. These results suggest the possibility that, rather than a primary influence of increased dopamine concentration on elevating bar-pressing responses during extinction, other neurotransmitter systems may be involved.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eeb","authors":["Parnell L Davis-MacNevin","Jordan Dekraker","Liane LaDouceur","Matthew R Holahan"],"doi":"10.1177\/0269881113492029","endpage":"864","first_seen_on":"2013-08-31T00:37:17+00:00","issns":["0269-8811","1461-7285"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1377909150,"links":["http:\/\/m.jop.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/06\/06\/0269881113492029.abstract","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/0269881113492029"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jop.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2013\/06\/06\/0269881113492029.full.pdf","pmid":"23761388","pubdate":"2013-06-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"854","subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Comparison of the MK-801-induced increase in non-rewarded appetitive responding with dopamine agonists and locomotor activity in rats","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/10.1177\/0269881113492029","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-mk801induced-increase-nonrewarded-appetitive-responding-dopamine-agonists-locomotor-activ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620974,"mean":4.9299989306774,"rank":2904549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71988,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620974,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87995,"mean":7.6672841330092,"rank":70247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87995,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":638,"mean":8.3259811616954,"rank":537,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":638,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":3.0136363636364,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
