The structural transformation from non-porous to porous MOFs and the purity of these products can be modulated by controlling the reaction temperature. The periodic-increased porosity observed was further confirmed by CO2 adsorption isotherms. Owing to the presence of acylamide groups in the pore walls and the flexible nature of the skeleton of these MOFs, highly selective CO2 adsorption over N2 was observed, as well as structure-dependent periodic varieties in luminescence properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Wu, Xiao\u2010Liu","Luo, Feng","Sun, Gong\u2010Ming","Zheng, An\u2010Min","Zhang, Jian","Luo, Ming\u2010Biao","Xu, Wen\u2010Yuan","Zhu, Yan","Zhang, Xiao\u2010Min","Huang, Shu\u2010Yun"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201300564","endpage":"3599","first_seen_on":"2013-09-03T14:25:00+00:00","issns":["1439-7641","1439-4235"],"issue":"15","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1378218087,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201300564\/abstract;jsessionid=A8D13C4C24B3D96C9FCCD2D0BEBDA0CB.d04t01"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201300564\/pdf","pmid":"24038959","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
