The most characteristic finding by magnetic resonance imaging is diffuse cortical swelling of the cerebellum, often complicated by hydrocephalus or tonsillar herniation. A timely assessment and appropriate choice of treatment, including surgical intervention when indicated, are key to improving the outcome of affected patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024d5","authors":["Sawaishi, Yukio","Takada, Goro"],"doi":"10.1080\/14734220260418457","first_seen_on":"2013-09-02T20:40:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1473-4222"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cerebellum","last_mentioned_on":1378154319,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12879984"],"pmid":"12879984","pubdate":"2002-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Acute cerebellitis.","type":"article","volume":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/acute-cerebellitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":2904887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88469,"mean":7.5824170095403,"rank":70429,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88469,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323,"mean":1.9925403726708,"rank":298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.261,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
