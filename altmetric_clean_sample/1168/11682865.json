Little is known about how language or undocumented immigration status impacts their care experience.\nA cross-sectional survey was administered to English (N\u00a0=\u00a0310) and Spanish-speaking LEP (N\u00a0=\u00a056) caregivers of pediatric cancer patients. To assess differences in healthcare experiences between the language groups, t-tests and chi-square statistics were used. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations between primary language and knowledge of clinical trial status.\nSpanish-speaking caregivers were more likely to report higher rates of quitting or changing jobs as a direct result of their child's cancer, and their children were more likely to experience a delay in education. Although Spanish-speaking caregivers reported higher satisfaction with care, 32% reported feeling that their child would have received better care if English was their primary language. Spanish-speaking caregivers were more likely to incorrectly identify whether their child was on a clinical trial compared with English-speaking caregivers. The majority of Spanish-speaking caregivers reported at least one undocumented caregiver in the household and 11% of them avoided or delayed medical care for their child due to concerns over their undocumented immigration status.\nLanguage barriers and undocumented immigration status may negatively impact the quality of informed decision-making and the care experience for Spanish-speaking LEP caregivers of pediatric cancer patients. These families may benefit from culturally appropriate Spanish language resources to improve communication and open a dialogue regarding undocumented immigration status.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Zamora, Eduardo R","Kaul, Sapna","Kirchhoff, Anne C","Gwilliam, Vannina","Jimenez, Ornella A","Morreall, Deborah K","Montenegro, Roberto E","Kinney, Anita Y","Fluchel, Mark N","Eduardo R.
