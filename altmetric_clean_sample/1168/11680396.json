Despite their giant size, intraparenchymal GCMs are low-flow vascular malformations. Herein, we report a case of hyper-vascular intraparenchymal GCM with an AV shunt in a child.\nA 3-year-old boy had had an enlarged head since infancy. Magnetic resonance (MR) images on admission showed a strikingly enhanced mass lesion, 6\u00a0cm in size. A 4-vessel CAG demonstrated a hyper-vascular mass with an AV shunt. After transarterial embolization, the patient underwent total excision of the mass. The tumor bled easily, during surgery the patient lost 400\u00a0cm(3) in blood. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.\nThe differential diagnosis of intraparenchymal, strikingly-enhanced tumors with an AV shunt include hyper-vascular GCMs. Consideration of potential for bleeding during the operation is also important.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["Hirata, Koji","Ihara, Satoshi","Sato, Masayuki","Matsumaru, Yuji","Yamamoto, Tetsuya"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00381-016-3234-8","first_seen_on":"2016-09-03T17:57:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-0350","0256-7040"],"journal":"Child's Nervous System","last_mentioned_on":1472924692,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27585994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27585994","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Hyper-vascular giant cavernous malformation in a child: a case report and review","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypervascular-giant-cavernous-malformation-child-case-report-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":7193796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251996,"mean":12.465311470465,"rank":210956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251996,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":1.9057338551859,"rank":681,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":2.1563,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PedNeurBriefs\/statuses\/772128239237996544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11680396],"posted_on":"2016-09-03T17:44:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Ped Neurology Briefs","url":"http:\/\/www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/763925960097800192\/QpZJcQcD_normal.jpg","description":"Pediatric Neurology Briefs (PNB) is the leading journal review focusing on child neurology since 1987. #OpenAccess on #PubMed & #PubMedCentral.","id_on_source":"PedNeurBriefs","tweeter_id":"759957720","geo":{"lt":41.85003,"ln":-87.65005,"country":"US"},"followers":2054},"tweet_id":"772128239237996544"}]}}
