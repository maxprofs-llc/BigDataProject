Vascular imaging performed after these events was reviewed for ISR. Annual rates for symptomatic ISR were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.\nOf 183 patients in the stenting group without a periprocedural primary end point, 27 (14.8%) had a symptomatic infarction (stroke or cerebral infarct with temporary signs) and 16 (8.7%) had transient ischemic attack alone in the territory during a median follow-up of 35.0 months. Of the 27 patients with infarctions, 17 (9.3%) had an ischemic stroke and 10 (5.5%) had a cerebral infarct with temporary signs alone. Adequate vascular imaging to evaluate ISR was available in 24 patients with infarctions (showing ISR in 16 [66.7%]) and in 10 patients with transient ischemic attack alone (showing ISR in 8 [80%]). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year rates (with 95% confidence limits) for symptomatic ISR in the SAMMPRIS stent cohort were 9.6% (6.1%-14.9%), 11.3% (7.5%-17.0%), and 14.0% (9.6%-20.2%), respectively.\nSymptomatic ISR occurred in at least 1 of 7 patients in SAMMPRIS by 3 years of follow-up and was likely responsible for the majority of nonprocedural cerebral infarctions.\nURL: https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov.
