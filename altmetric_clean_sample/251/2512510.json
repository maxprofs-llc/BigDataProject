Recent developments in imaging have enabled the evaluation of smaller animal models with sufficient spatial resolution. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate species, has been widely used in neuroscience research, to which voxel-wise statistics could be extended with a species-specific brain template. Here, we report, for the first time, a tissue-segmented, population-averaged standard template of the common marmoset brain. This template was created by using anatomical T(1)-weighted images from 22 adult marmosets with a high-resolution isotropic voxel size of (0.2 mm)(3) at 7-Tesla and DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Whole brain templates are available at International Neuroinformatics Japan Node website, http:\/\/brainatlas.brain.riken.jp\/marmoset\/.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Hikishima K","Quallo MM","Komaki Y","Yamada M","Kawai K","Momoshima S","Okano HJ","Sasaki E","Tamaoki N","Lemon RN","Iriki A","Okano H"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2010.10.061","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T05:12:42+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc"],"issns":["1053-8119"],"issue":"4","journal":"NeuroImage","last_mentioned_on":1277074800,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuroimage.2010.10.061"],"pmid":"21044887","pubdate":"2010-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Population-averaged standard template brain atlas for the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/populationaveraged-standard-template-brain-atlas-common-marmoset-callithrix-jacchus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2017675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90069,"mean":7.3368510458765,"rank":47036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":24393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90069,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3030,"mean":5.3254730934302,"rank":1895,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3030,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":4.0328965517241,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
