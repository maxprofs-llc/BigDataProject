Due to their rarity, the mechanisms of M-cell function and differentiation are poorly understood. To overcome this problem, experimental strategies to enrich for M-cells have been established. Transcriptome analyses have provided valuable insight, especially on the receptors for antigen uptake, and such studies have broadened our knowledge of M-cell function. In another line of investigation, we and others have begun to dissect the molecular pathways of M-cell differentiation. Among them, receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) has been identified as an essential factor for M-cell differentiation. We have focused on the M-cell inducible activity of RANKL and have been able to observe temporal transitions during M-cell differentiation by using in vivo ectopic M-cell differentiation induced by exogenous RANKL treatment. We have found that the ets-family transcription factor Spi-B is essential for functional maturation of M cells. In the absence of Spi-B, the immune response to Salmonella Typhimurium is severely impaired, suggesting that M cells are important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["Takashi Kanaya","Hiroshi Ohno"],"doi":"10.12938\/bmfh.33.91","first_seen_on":"2014-07-18T10:09:15+00:00","issns":["2186-6953"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bioscience of microbiota, food and health","last_mentioned_on":1405678141,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25032083?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25032083","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The Mechanisms of M-cell Differentiation.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mechanisms-mcell-differentiation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
