Our patient is a 28 year-old white male. On admission 70% of his body surface area was involved with large bullae overlying urticarial plaques, involving his upper and lower extremities, chest, and abdomen. The circulating level of sCD200 was 48.45 pg\/mL in serum and 243 pg\/mL in blister fluid. During the second month of follow-up, the patient's sCD200 level decreased to 26.7 pg\/mL. After the second round of omalizumab (300 mg), frequency of exacerbations decreased and after the 13th round it had completely disappeared.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f06","authors":["Yalcin AD","Genc GE","Celik B","Gumuslu S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T10:16:51+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical Laboratory","last_mentioned_on":1405419382,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24697134"],"pmid":"24697134","pubdate":"2014-04-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"title":"Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) is effective in treating bullous pemphigoid and its effects on soluble CD200.","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiige-monoclonal-antibody-omalizumab-effective-treating-bullous-pemphigoid-effects-soluble-cd200"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3056417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109560,"mean":8.0153637765955,"rank":72878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":25826,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109560,"percentile":23},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":1.1559259259259,"rank":70,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
