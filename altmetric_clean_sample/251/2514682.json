In this investigation, we evaluated the use of response restriction FCT (RR FCT) in a cohort of patients with poorly differentiated responding of the FCR during mult FCT. Results showed that (a) RR FCT maintained high rates of correct FCRs during the reinforcement component of RR FCT without increasing destructive behavior; (b) children displayed highly discriminated FCRs when an FCR card and a control card were simultaneously available during the reinforcement component of RR FCT; and (c) near-zero rates of destructive behavior were observed during the last five sessions of the terminal reinforcement schedule. Results are discussed relative to differences between mult FCT and RR FCT and successive and simultaneous discriminations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f610003464","doi":"10.1016\/j.ridd.2014.06.024","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T19:13:57+00:00","issns":["08914222"],"journal":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","last_mentioned_on":1405540433,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0891422214002686"],"pmid":"25036315","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"title":"Decreasing excessive functional communication responses while treating destructive behavior using response restriction ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decreasing-excessive-functional-communication-responses-while-treating-destructive-behavior-using-re"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3579166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":142488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109539,"mean":8.0670791323562,"rank":84743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1127,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109539,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":997,"mean":2.3508915662651,"rank":660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":997,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.167,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
