As PKD advances, cyst growth increases kidney volume, decreases renal function, and may lead to end-stage renal disease; however, in a PKD rat model, feeding soy protein isolate (SPI) reduced cyst proliferation and growth. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are noted for their anti-inflammatory actions. Therefore, diet therapy could offer a potentially efficacious, safe, and cost-effective strategy for treating PKD. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of soy protein and\/or n-3 PUFAs on PKD progression and severity in the rat model of autosomal recessive PKD. We hypothesized that the antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory actions associated with soy protein and n-3 PUFA supplementation will attenuate PKD progression in female PCK rats. For 12weeks, young (age, 28 days) female PCK rats were randomly assigned (n=12\/group) to 4 different diets: casein\u00b1corn oil, casein\u00b1soybean oil, SPI\u00b1soybean oil, or SPI\u00b11:1 soybean\/salmon oil (SPI\u00b1SB). The feeding of the different protein and lipid sources had no significant effect on relative kidney weight. Histologic evaluation showed no significant differences in cortical or medullary cyst size, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis among diet groups. However, rats fed SPI\u00b1SB diet had cortical cyst obstruction and the highest (P<.01) serum blood urea nitrogen concentration. Rats fed SPI\u00b1SB diet had the highest (P<.001) renal docosahexaeonic acid, but there were no significant differences in renal tissue inflammation and proliferation gene expression among the diet groups. Based on these results, dietary soy protein and\/or n-3 PUFAs did not attenuate disease progression or severity in the female PCK rat model of autosomal recessive PKD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5103cf058f61000321e","authors":["Kaitlin H Maditz","Chris Oldaker","Nainika Nanda","Vagner Benedito","Ryan Livengood","Janet C Tou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.nutres.2014.05.001","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T10:03:42+00:00","issns":["1879-0739"],"issue":"6","journal":"Nutrition Research","last_mentioned_on":1405591329,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25026920?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25026920","pubdate":"2014-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or soy protein isolate did not attenuate disease progression in a female rat model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dietary-n3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-soy-protein-isolate-not-attenuate-disease-progression-female-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4035537,"mean":5.0585865404749,"rank":3227327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":100014,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4035537,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96265,"mean":8.0890555347794,"rank":76541,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":344,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96265,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":505,"mean":6.1986071428571,"rank":394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":505,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.2340909090909,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/libroazuln\/status\/489711646109990912","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2516396],"posted_on":"2014-07-17T10:02:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Libro Azul","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Libro-Azul\/279667772085894?sk=app_190322544333196","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1733482297\/Bright_512x512_normal.png","description":"La desnutrici\u00f3n es un factor que se asocia con mal pron\u00f3stico en pacientes hospitalizados y ambulatorios","id_on_source":"libroazuln","tweeter_id":"454601506","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"489711646109990912"}]}}
