It is possible that the body may develop certain compensatory mechanisms to alleviate the abnormalities. The norepinephrine (NE) system originating mainly in the locus coeruleus (LC) is defective in RTT and Mecp2-null mice. LC neurons are subject to modulation by GABA, glutamate and acetylcholine (Ach), providing an ideal system to test the compensatory hypothesis. Here we show evidence for potential compensatory modulation of LC neurons by post- and presynaptic Ach inputs. We found that the post-synaptic currents of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) were smaller in amplitude and longer in decay time in the Mecp2-null mice than in the WT. Single cell PCR analysis showed a decrease in the expression of \u03b13, \u03b14, \u03b17 and \u03b23 subunits and an increase in the \u03b15 and \u03b16 subunits in the mutant mice. The \u03b15 subunit was present in many of the LC neurons with slow decay nAchR currents. The nicotinic modulation of spontaneous GABAA-ergic IPSCs in LC neurons was enhanced in Mecp2-null mice. In contrast, the nAchR manipulation of glutamatergic input to LC neurons was unaffected in both groups of mice. Our current clamp studies showed that the modulation of LC neurons by Ach input was reduced moderately in Mecp2-null mice despite the major decrease in nAchR currents suggesting possible compensatory processes may take place, thus reducing the defects to a lesser extent in LC neurons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000220d","doi":"10.1152\/ajpcell.00035.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T17:14:22+00:00","issns":["1522-1563"],"journal":"American Journal of Physiology: Cell Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1411034166,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1152\/ajpcell.00035.2014","http:\/\/ajpcell.physiology.org\/content\/307\/6\/C508"],"pmid":"25009110","pubdate":"2014-07-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","physiology"],"title":"Alterations in the cholinergic system of brain stem neurons in a mouse model of Rett syndrome","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alterations-cholinergic-system-brain-stem-neurons-mouse-model-rett-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1985495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2420694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104461,"mean":8.1782281064524,"rank":41912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":59781,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104461,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":773,"mean":2.1006191709845,"rank":304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":456,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":773,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.26,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
