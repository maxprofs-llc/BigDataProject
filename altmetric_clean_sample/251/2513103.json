A total of 120 patients undergoing hysterosalpingography were randomised into four groups. Patients received intramuscular dexketoprofen trometamol with or without a paracervical block or intracavitary lidocaine instillation with or without paracervical block. The primary outcome was the overall pain score from the four stages of the procedure. The lowest pain scores were observed in the patients receiving dexketoprofen trometamol with a paracervical block, whereas the highest pain scores were observed in patients with intracavitary lidocaine instillation without a paracervical block (p = 0.021). No beneficial effect was found when a paracervical block (PCB) was added to either systemic or local analgesics. The combination of intramuscular dexketoprofen and a paracervical block with plain lidocaine produced the best pain relief during the three specified steps and at up to 30 min after the HSG procedure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f610004084","authors":["Hacivelioglu S","Gencer M","Cakir Gungor A","Kosar S","Koc E","Cosar E"],"doi":"10.3109\/01443615.2013.828025","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T10:22:05+00:00","issns":["0144-3615"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1405506107,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24359050?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24359050","pubdate":"2013-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Can the addition of a paracervical block to systemic or local analgesics improve the pain perceived by the patient during hysterosalpingography?","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/addition-paracervical-block-systemic-local-analgesics-improve-pain-perceived-patient-during-hysteros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4032273,"mean":5.0563113323429,"rank":3224289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":100069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4032273,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100989,"mean":7.9066428090467,"rank":80293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":3.028528189911,"rank":247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.3144444444444,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
