The latest census information reveals that citizens with limited English proficiency (LEP) represent approximately 16% of the population. The inability to effectively communicate creates stark challenges in the delivery and receipt of health care. Language discordance in the healthcare setting has been firmly established as a source for health disparities among LEP patients and families. Poorer health outcomes are seen across the healthcare setting for LEP patients and children of LEP parents.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"53222dc92a83ee27268b457e","authors":["Regan Freeman, Rebecca"],"doi":"10.1002\/2327-6924.12148","endpage":"176","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T12:25:04+00:00","issns":["2327-6924","2327-6886"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners","last_mentioned_on":1405599859,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2327-6924.12148\/abstract;jsessionid=0D9C04FC1F59467D67BB8562FB3FA838.f02t03"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/2327-6924.12148\/pdf","pmid":"25044779","pubdate":"2014-07-17T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"167","title":"Primary care for limited English\u2010speaking patients and parents","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-care-limited-englishspeaking-patients-parents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6260376,"mean":5.9886212752443,"rank":4629424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":938506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6260376,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132152,"mean":8.3113633949044,"rank":87467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":26358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132152,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123,"mean":2.2461803278689,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.7194285714286,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
