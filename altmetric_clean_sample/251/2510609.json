For this purpose, several antisense or small interfering RNA based gene silencing techniques have been frequently employed in plant research. Artificial microRNAs (amiRNAs) mediated gene silencing represents one of such techniques which can utilize as a potential tool in functional genomics. Similar to microRNAs, amiRNAs are single-stranded, approximately 21\u00a0nt long, and designed by replacing the mature miRNA sequences of duplex within pre-miRNAs. These amiRNAs are processed via small RNA biogenesis and silencing machinery and deregulate target expression. Holding to various refinements, amiRNA technology offers several advantages over other gene silencing methods. This is a powerful and robust tool, and could be applied to unravel new insight of metabolic pathways and gene functions across the various disciplines as well as in translating observations for improving favourable traits in plants. This review highlights general background of small RNAs, improvements made in RNAi based gene silencing, implications of amiRNA in gene silencing, and describes future themes for improving value of this technology in plant science.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008542","authors":["Manish Tiwari","Deepika Sharma","Prabodh Kumar Trivedi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11103-014-0224-7","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T14:20:00+00:00","issns":["1573-5028","0167-4412"],"journal":"Plant Molecular Biology","last_mentioned_on":1405433949,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11103-014-0224-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11103-014-0224-7.pdf","pmid":"25022825","pubdate":"2014-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Pathology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","botany"],"title":"Artificial microRNA mediated gene silencing in plants: progress and perspectives","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/artificial-microrna-mediated-gene-silencing-plants-progress-perspectives-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":3037844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":928723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109565,"mean":8.0780412544269,"rank":71605,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109565,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":450,"mean":1.8438574610245,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":450,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.48684210526316,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
