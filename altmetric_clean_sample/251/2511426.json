By adding dilute cross-linkers to a chemically amplified molecular resist, we synergize entropic and enthalpic contributions to dissolution by harnessing both changes to molecular weight and changes in intermolecular bonding to create a system that outperforms resists that emphasize one contribution over the other. We study patterning performance, resist modulus, solubility kinetics and material redistribution as a function of cross-linker concentration. Cross-linking varies from dilute oligomerization to creating a highly networked system. The addition of small amounts of cross-linker improves resist performance by reducing material diffusion and redistribution during development and stiffening the features to avoid pattern collapse. The new dilute cross-linking system achieves the highest resolution of a sensitive molecular glass resist at 20 nm half-pitch and line-edge roughness (LER) of 4.3 nm and can inform new resist design towards patterned feature control at the molecular level.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","authors":["Prashant K Kulshreshtha","Ken Maruyama","Sara Kiani","James Blackwell","Deirdre L Olynick","Paul D Ashby"],"doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T20:15:41+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["0957-4484","1361-6528"],"issue":"31","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1405569720,"links":["http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301\/","http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301#.U8cf2xzTMMM.facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1088\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1088\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25026410"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iopscience.iop.org\/0957-4484\/25\/31\/315301\/pdf\/0957-4484_25_31_315301.pdf","pmid":"25026410","pubdate":"2014-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"315301","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Harnessing entropic and enthalpic contributions to create a negative tone chemically amplified molecular resist for high-resolution lithography.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/harnessing-entropic-enthalpic-contributions-create-negative-tone-chemically-amplified-molecular-resi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":58.842,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":58.842},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":55042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4452836,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":98},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109565,"mean":8.077210379322,"rank":2936,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":106629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109565,"percentile":97},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":995,"mean":5.249661971831,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":995,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":19.553161290323,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
