The prevalence of drivers being in a hangover phase, in the driving population, and the relation to impairment relevant for traffic-safety has, however, not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the concentrations of the two ethanol metabolites, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulphate (EtS), in blood, indicating very recent alcohol intake, among apprehended drivers, in which no psychoactive substances, including alcohol, were detected. The aim was also to study these findings in relation to the impairment observed in these drivers. Methods Blood samples, drawn from suspected drunk or drugged drivers, were analysed for a broad repertoire of psychoactive substances, with a clinical test for impairment (CTI) being performed at the same time. One-hundred-and-forty-six cases, in which no psychoactive substances were detected, and where a valid CTI was performed, were analysed for EtG and EtS, in blood. The prevalence and the concentrations were related to the conclusions of the CTIs. Results EtS and EtG were detected in a total of 19 of the 146 cases (13%). Among the \"impaired\" drivers, EtG and EtS were detected in 16 cases (18%), while among \"not impaired\" drivers; they were detected in 3 cases (5%). There were significantly more detections of EtS (and EtG) among the impaired group of drivers compared with the not-impaired drivers (p = 0.030), and the concentrations of both EtG (p = 0.027) and EtS (p = 0.026) were significantly higher in the group of impaired drivers compared with the not-impaired drivers. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the concentrations of EtG (Spearman\u00b4s rho = 0.170, p = 0.041) and EtS (Spearman\u00b4s rho = 0.189, p = 0.022) and the degree of impairment. Conclusions EtG and EtS were prevalent findings in blood collected from the apprehended drivers, testing negative for all psychoactive substances. The higher rates of detections of EtG and EtS in impaired compared to not impaired drivers, and also the positive correlation between concentrations of EtG and EtS and the degree of impairment, indicate that hangover symptoms may be relevant for traffic-safety.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d63cf058f6100010df","authors":["Gudrun H\u00f8iseth","Jan Toralf Fosen","Veronica Liane","Stig Tore Bogstrand","J\u00f8rg M\u00f8rland","H\u00f8iseth G","Fosen JT","Liane V","Bogstrand ST","M\u00f8rland J"],"doi":"10.1080\/15389588.2014.938324","endpage":"328","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T22:05:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1538-957X","1538-9588"],"issue":"4","journal":"Traffic Injury Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1432223794,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25023858?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15389588.2014.938324","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/15389588.2014.938324","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/15389588.2014.938324?journalCode=gcpi20#.VI75HCuUfLM","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/15389588.2014.938324#tabModule"],"pmid":"25023858","pubdate":"2014-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Automotive Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"323","title":"Alcohol Hangover as a Cause of Impairment in Apprehended Drivers.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alcohol-hangover-cause-impairment-apprehended-drivers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":31.254,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":31.254},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6320641,"mean":5.9750574467146,"rank":187190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":6133833,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6320641,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":139817,"mean":8.0866073267725,"rank":6601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":133216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":139817,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":657,"mean":2.3391493902439,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":657,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.5735294117647,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
