Serum CXCL9 (and for comparison CXCL10) has been measured in patients with AT vs normal control and nontoxic multinodular goiter, and this parameter has been related to the clinical phenotype. For this study we selected 189 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AT, 63 euthyroid controls, 30 patients with nontoxic multinodular goiter. The three groups were similar in gender distribution and age; 26% of AT patients had subclinical hypothyroidism. Serum CXCL9 was significantly higher in AT (148\u00b1110 pg\/mL) than in controls (71\u00b134 pg\/mL) or patients with multinodular goiter (87\u00b135 pg\/mL) (p<0.0001). Among AT patients, CXCL9 levels were significantly higher in patients older than 50 years, those with a hypoechoic ultrasonographic pattern or with hypothyroidism. Also CXCL10 was confirmed to be associated with AT, overall in presence of hypothyroidism. In a multiple linear regression model of CXCL9 (ln[pg\/mL]) vs age, thyroid volume, TSH, AbTg, AbTPO, hypoechoic pattern, the presence of hypervascularity, and CXCL10 (ln[pg\/mL]), only TSH and CXCL10 (ln[pg\/mL]) were significantly related to serum CXCL9 levels. We show that circulating CXCL9 is increased in patients with aggressive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism. A strong relation between circulating CXCL9 and CXCL10 has been first shown, underlining the importance of a T helper 1 immune attack in the initiation of AT.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c4","doi":"10.1016\/j.cyto.2011.04.022","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T20:45:36+00:00","issns":["10434666"],"journal":"Cytokine","last_mentioned_on":1411942421,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1043466611001463"],"pmid":"21601475","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Circulating chemokine (CXC motif) ligand (CXCL)9 is increased in aggressive chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, in association with CXCL10 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-chemokine-cxc-motif-ligand-cxcl9-increased-aggressive-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis-ass"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4304397,"mean":4.9834667718655,"rank":3202718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":901400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4304397,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105988,"mean":7.7607850208045,"rank":78287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":22644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105988,"percentile":21},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":562,"mean":1.7557254901961,"rank":357,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":562,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":2.09,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
