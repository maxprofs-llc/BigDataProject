Manual and exercise therapies are common and effective therapies for the general LBP and NP populations. However, these treatments have not been adequately researched in older LBP and NP sufferers. The primary aim of these studies is to assess the relative clinical effectiveness of 1) manual treatment plus home exercise, 2) supervised rehabilitative exercise plus home exercise, and 3) home exercise alone, in terms of patient-rated pain, for senior LBP and NP patients. Secondary aims are to compare the three treatment approaches in regards to patient-rated disability, general health status, satisfaction, improvement and medication use, as well as objective outcomes of spinal motion, trunk strength and endurance, and functional ability. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility will also be assessed. Finally, using qualitative methods, older LBP and NP patient's perceptions of treatment will be explored and described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Maiers, Michele J","Hartvigsen, Jan","Schulz, Craig","Schulz, Karen","Evans, Roni L","Bronfort, Gert"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-8-94","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T14:33:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1405521166,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/8\/94"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2474-8-94.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2048958","pmid":"17877825","pubdate":"2007-09-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"94","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Chiropractic and exercise for seniors with low back pain or neck pain: the design of two randomized clinical trials","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chiropractic-exercise-seniors-low-back-pain-neck-pain-design-two-randomized-clinical-trials-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4032273,"mean":5.0563113323429,"rank":2259648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1036141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4032273,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100989,"mean":7.9066428090467,"rank":54016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100989,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1426,"mean":3.6493473684211,"rank":876,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1426,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99,"mean":3.9457755102041,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
