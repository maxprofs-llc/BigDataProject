The high prevalence of leg ulcer directly affects patients' quality of life because it produces psychological (anxiety, depression), social and physical (amputation) handicap. Most leg ulcers become unsightly and they hardly if ever, yield to conventional treatment. Healing of an amputated part may pose a problem, hence amputation cannot be recommended without extensive pre-operative investigations. Prevalence is high among the poor, for whom expenses of surgery are not affordable. Few surgeons try skin graft but unfavourable local condition of the ulcer leads to rejection and all efforts prove futile. Keeping all these factors in mind, we have tested a Unani formulation for its ulcer healing properties; early results were surprising and in some cases unbelievable.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e83cf058f6100059c4","authors":["Zulkifle M","Ansari AH","Shakir M","Kamal Z","Alam MT","Zulkifle, Mohd","Ansari, Abdul H","Shakir, Mohd","Kamal, Zahid","Alam, Md Tanwir"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1742-481x.2012.01099.x","endpage":"372","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T13:56:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1742-4801","1742-481X"],"issue":"4","journal":"International Wound Journal","last_mentioned_on":1465760318,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1742-481X.2012.01099.x\/citedby","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1742-481X.2012.01099.x#.V126NBK6WP4.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1742-481X.2012.01099.x\/pdf","pmid":"23116214","pubdate":"2012-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Pub.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"366","title":"Management of non healing leg ulcers in Unani system of medicine.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-nonhealing-leg-ulcers-unani-system-medicine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7885400,"mean":6.6781117138083,"rank":3905842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3779239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7885400,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178273,"mean":7.475903316281,"rank":77466,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":94604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178273,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":358,"mean":4.4456134453782,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":358,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.91875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
