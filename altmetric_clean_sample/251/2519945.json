Association of #atherosclerosis in the descending aorta with #CAD."],"citation":{"abstract":"The association between atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA) visualized on computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) and coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been extensively explored. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of DTA atherosclerosis on CTA was performed and the association of DTA atherosclerosis with CAD was evaluated in patients with suspected CAD. A total of 344 patients (54 \u00b1 12 years, 54% men) with suspected CAD underwent CTA. CTA were classified based on CAD severity in no signs of atherosclerosis or minor wall-irregularities <30%, non-significant CAD 30-50%, or significant CAD \u226550% stenosis. The DTA was divided in segments according the posterior intercostal arteries. Per segment the presence of atherosclerotic plaque (defined as \u22652 mm wall thickness) was determined and maximal wall thickness was measured. Plaque composition was scored as non-calcified or mixed and the percentage of DTA segments with atherosclerosis was calculated. Significant CAD was present in 152 (44%) patients and 278 (81%) had DTA atherosclerotic plaque. DTA maximal wall thickness and percentage of DTA segments with atherosclerosis were 2.7 \u00b1 1 mm and 49 \u00b1 36%. The presence, severity and extent of DTA atherosclerosis significantly increased with increasing CAD severity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis corrected for age and other risk factors demonstrated independent associations of DTA plaque (OR 6.56, 95% CI 1.78-24.19, p = 0.005) and maximal DTA wall thickness (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.28-3.12, p = 0.002) with significant CAD. The presence and severity of DTA atherosclerosis were independently related with significant CAD on CTA in patients with suspected CAD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007843","authors":["Roos CJ","Witkowska AJ","de Graaf MA","Veltman CE","Delgado V","de Grooth GJ","Jukema JW","Bax JJ","Scholte AJ"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10554-013-0266-y","first_seen_on":"2014-07-18T10:46:03+00:00","issns":["1569-5794"],"issue":"","journal":"The International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging (formerly Cardiac Imaging)","last_mentioned_on":1405695434,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23893257?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23893257","pubdate":"2013-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Association of atherosclerosis in the descending thoracic aorta with coronary artery disease on multi detector row computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-atherosclerosis-descending-thoracic-aorta-coronary-artery-disease-multi-detector-row-com"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":1922207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2542582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109629,"mean":7.9152491151898,"rank":41656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":66706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109629,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":0.63158549222798,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.74875,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":3,"NL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArieBlitzMD\/status\/490085798335619072","license":"datasift","rt":["cardiacimaging"],"citation_ids":[2519945],"posted_on":"2014-07-18T10:48:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Arie Blitz, MD, MBA","url":"http:\/\/youtube.com\/heartfixer100","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/480098073125728256\/y5bhDFg3_normal.jpeg","description":"All the heart & health care news that's fit to tweet\u2192 I cover the latest topics for all audiences, from lay to professional.  #Cardiology #CTSurgery #meded","id_on_source":"ArieBlitzMD","tweeter_id":"2579257620","geo":{"lt":26.20341,"ln":-98.23001,"country":"US"},"followers":3199},"tweet_id":"490085798335619072"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArieBlitzMD\/status\/490086570041430017","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2519945],"posted_on":"2014-07-18T10:51:58+00:00","author":{"name":"Arie Blitz, MD, MBA","url":"http:\/\/youtube.com\/heartfixer100","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/480098073125728256\/y5bhDFg3_normal.jpeg","description":"All the heart & health care news that's fit to tweet\u2192 I cover the latest topics for all audiences, from lay to professional.  #Cardiology #CTSurgery #meded","id_on_source":"ArieBlitzMD","tweeter_id":"2579257620","geo":{"lt":26.20341,"ln":-98.23001,"country":"US"},"followers":3199},"tweet_id":"490086570041430017"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmitRPatelMD\/status\/490090630014455809","license":"datasift","rt":["ArieBlitzMD"],"citation_ids":[2519945],"posted_on":"2014-07-18T11:08:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Amit R.
