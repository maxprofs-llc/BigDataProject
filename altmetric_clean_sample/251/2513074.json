Microbiological examination of rhizosphere soil have revealed that combined use of colloidal solution of nanoparticles of molybdenum (CSNM, 8\u00a0mg\/l), and microbial preparation for pre-sowing inoculation of chickpea seeds stimulates the development of 'agronomically valuable' microflora. It was shown that combined seed treatment with colloidal solution of Mo nanoparticles with microbial preparation have stimulated nodule formation per plant by four times compared to controls. Single treatment with CSNM increased the number of nodules by two times, while the treatment of microbial preparation have not significantly affected the number of nodules per plant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000877","authors":["Natalia Yu Taran","Olena M Gonchar","Kostyantyn G Lopatko","Lyudmila M Batsmanova","Mykola V Patyka","Mykola V Volkogon"],"doi":"10.1186\/1556-276x-9-289","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T10:19:51+00:00","issns":["1931-7573"],"issue":"1","journal":"Nanoscale Research Letters","last_mentioned_on":1405505967,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25024677?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25024677","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Condensed Matter Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Materials Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Material Science","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanoscale Science and Technology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nanotechnology and Microengineering","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences","Materials Science"],"title":"The effect of colloidal solution of molybdenum nanoparticles on the microbial composition in rhizosphere of Cicer arietinum L.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-colloidal-solution-molybdenum-nanoparticles-microbial-composition-rhizosphere-cicer-arietinum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4032273,"mean":5.0563113323429,"rank":2259648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1036141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4032273,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100989,"mean":7.9066428090466,"rank":54016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100989,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":410,"mean":0.93096821515892,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":317,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":410,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.0833333333333,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
