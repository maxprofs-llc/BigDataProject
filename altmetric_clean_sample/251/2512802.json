Current emissions inventories use emissions factors determined from small-scale laboratory experiments that have not been compared to field-scale measurements. We compiled published data on field-scale measurements of greenhouse gas emissions from working and research dairies and compared these to rates predicted by the IPCC Tier 2 modeling approach. Anaerobic lagoons were the largest source of methane (368\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0193\u00a0kg CH4 \u00a0hd(-1) \u00a0yr(-1) ), more than three times that from enteric fermentation (~120\u00a0kg CH4 \u00a0hd(-1) \u00a0yr(-1) ). Corrals and solid manure piles were large sources of nitrous oxide (1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 and 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0kg N2 O\u00a0hd(-1) \u00a0yr(-1) , respectively). Nitrous oxide emissions from anaerobic lagoons (0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg N2 O\u00a0hd(-1) \u00a0yr(-1) ) and barns (10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0kg N2 O\u00a0hd(-1) \u00a0yr(-1) ) were unexpectedly large. Modeled methane emissions underestimated field measurement means for most manure management practices. Modeled nitrous oxide emissions underestimated field measurement means for anaerobic lagoons and manure piles, but overestimated emissions from slurry storage. Revised emissions factors nearly doubled slurry CH4 emissions for Europe and increased N2 O emissions from solid piles and lagoons in the United States by an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that current greenhouse gas emission factors generally underestimate emissions from dairy manure and highlight liquid manure systems as promising target areas for greenhouse gas mitigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002974","authors":["Owen JJ","Silver WL","Owen, Justine J.","Silver, Whendee L."],"doi":"10.1111\/gcb.12687","endpage":"565","first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T08:43:35+00:00","issns":["1365-2486","1354-1013"],"issue":"2","journal":"Global Change Biology","last_mentioned_on":1430418937,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12687\/abstract;jsessionid=F5DE6DA4DEF263BDA48C688E79020060.f03t04","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12687\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12687\/abstract;jsessionid=9A510FB2C837BA703BA79A51786620EB.f04t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25044806"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/gcb.12687\/pdf","pmid":"25044806","pubdate":"2014-07-15T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"550","title":"Greenhouse gas emissions from dairy manure management: a review of field-based studies.","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/greenhouse-gas-emissions-dairy-manure-management-review-fieldbased-studies-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6538717,"mean":6.066075403488,"rank":817438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":5718619,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6538717,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150731,"mean":7.9664990247464,"rank":23164,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":127443,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150731,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1992,"mean":14.267527875439,"rank":881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1992,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":15.955263157895,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
