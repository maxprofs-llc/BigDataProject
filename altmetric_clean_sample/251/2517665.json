End-of-life care is aimed at prolongation of life with good quality, but inevitably also may require medical decisions for prevention and relief of suffering with a potential life shortening effect. Few data are available on this end-of-life decision (ELD) making process in HGG patients, with decreased consciousness, confusion or cognitive deficits preventing them to participate. In this study the ELD-making process in HGG patients is described.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["Eefje M. Sizoo","H. Roeline W.
