However, its effect on muscle energy metabolism and energy-dependent muscle function remains largely unexplored. This question needs to be solved urgently since various therapies for neuromuscular diseases based on blockade of ActRIIB signaling are being developed. Here, we show in mice, that 4-month pharmacological abrogation of ActRIIB signaling by treatment with soluble ActRIIB-Fc triggers extreme muscle fatigability. This is associated with elevated serum lactate levels and a severe metabolic myopathy in the mdx mouse, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Blockade of ActRIIB signaling downregulates porin, a crucial ADP\/ATP shuttle between cytosol and mitochondrial matrix leading to a consecutive deficiency of oxidative phosphorylation as measured by in vivo Phophorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS). Further, ActRIIB blockade reduces muscle capillarization, which further compounds the metabolic stress. We show that ActRIIB regulates key determinants of muscle metabolism, such as Ppar\u03b2, Pgc1\u03b1, and Pdk4 thereby optimizing different components of muscle energy metabolism. In conclusion, ActRIIB signaling endows skeletal muscle with high oxidative capacity and low fatigability. The severe metabolic side effects following ActRIIB blockade caution against deploying this strategy, at least in isolation, for treatment of neuromuscular disorders.Molecular Therapy (2014); doi:10.1038\/mt.2014.90.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5083cf058f61000311d","authors":["Relizani K","Mouisel E","Giannesini B","Hourd\u00e9 C","Patel K","Gonzales SM","J\u00fclich K","Vignaud A","Pi\u00e9tri-Rouxel F","Fortin D","Garcia L","Blot S","Ritvos O","Bendahan D","Ferry A","Ventura-Clapier R","Schuelke M","Amthor H","Karima Relizani","Etienne Mouisel","Benoit Giannesini","Christophe Hourd\u00e9","Ketan Patel","Susanne Morales Gonzalez","Kristina J\u00fclich","Alban Vignaud","France Pi\u00e9tri-Rouxel","Dominique Fortin","Luis Garcia","St\u00e9phane Blot","Olli Ritvos","David Bendahan","Arnaud Ferry","Ren\u00e9e Ventura-Clapier","Markus Schuelke","Helge Amthor"],"doi":"10.1038\/mt.2014.90","endpage":"1433","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T17:14:59+00:00","funders":["bbsrc"],"issns":["1525-0016","1525-0024","15250016"],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecular Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1428250041,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/mt.2014.90","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24861054"],"pmid":"24861054","pubdate":"2014-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1423","subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Blockade of ActRIIB signaling triggers muscle fatigability and metabolic myopathy.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1525001616307390","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blockade-actriib-signaling-triggers-muscle-fatigability-metabolic-myopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7377679,"mean":6.4099891122884,"rank":3349957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3862902,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7377679,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168358,"mean":7.4056429848479,"rank":64620,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":98433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168358,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1161,"mean":9.06605,"rank":722,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1161,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":6.9696923076923,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
