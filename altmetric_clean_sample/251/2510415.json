With the recent emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., graphene, MoS2, phosphorene, etc.), it is natural to contemplate the behavior of Si in the 2D limit. Guided by atomic-scale studies utilizing ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and spectroscopy (STS), we have investigated the 2D limits of Si growth on Ag(111). In contrast to previous reports of a distinct sp(2)-bonded silicene allotrope, we observe the evolution of apparent surface alloys (ordered 2D silicon-Ag surface phases), which culminate in the precipitation of crystalline, sp(3)-bonded Si(111) nanosheets. These nanosheets are capped with a \u221a3 honeycomb phase that is isostructural to a \u221a3 honeycomb-chained-trimer (HCT) reconstruction of Ag on Si(111). Further investigations reveal evidence for silicon intermixing with the Ag(111) substrate followed by surface precipitation of crystalline, sp(3)-bonded silicon nanosheets. These conclusions are corroborated by ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Even at the 2D limit, scanning tunneling spectroscopy shows that the sp(3)-bonded silicon nanosheets exhibit semiconducting electronic properties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006816","doi":"10.1021\/nn503000w","first_seen_on":"2014-07-15T13:05:51+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"ACS Nano","last_mentioned_on":1497861719,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/nn503000w","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/doi:10.1021\/nn503000w","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/nn503000w"],"pmid":"25000460","pubdate":"2014-07-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Silicon Growth at the Two-Dimensional Limit on Ag(111).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/silicon-growth-twodimensional-limit-ag111"},"altmetric_score":{"score":17.568,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":17.568},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":501264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7890924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":180839,"mean":7.6880683374072,"rank":13146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":167693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":180839,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5079,"mean":12.120931469082,"rank":677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":4402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5079,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":215,"mean":8.8609252336449,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":215,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":14,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
