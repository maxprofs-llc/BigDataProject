Rising heat exposure in cities is projected to result from: 1) climate forcings from changing global atmospheric composition; and 2) local land surface characteristics responsible for the urban heat island effect. The extent to which heat management strategies designed to lessen the urban heat island effect could offset future heat-related mortality remains unexplored in the literature. Using coupled global and regional climate models with a human health effects model, we estimate changes in the number of heat-related deaths in 2050 resulting from modifications to vegetative cover and surface albedo across three climatically and demographically diverse US metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Employing separate health impact functions for average warm season and heat wave conditions in 2050, we find combinations of vegetation and albedo enhancement to offset projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40 to 99% across the three metropolitan regions. These results demonstrate the potential for extensive land surface changes in cities to provide adaptive benefits to urban populations at risk for rising heat exposure with climate change.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Brian Stone Jr","Jason Vargo","Peng Liu","Dana Habeeb","Anthony DeLucia","Marcus Trail","Yongtao Hu","Armistead Russell"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0100852","first_seen_on":"2014-07-17T05:12:32+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1932-6203",""],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1475981890,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0100852","http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0100852","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0100852"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0100852.PDF","pmid":"24964213","pubdate":"2014-06-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e100852","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Avoided Heat-Related Mortality through Climate Adaptation Strategies in Three US Cities","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/avoided-heatrelated-mortality-through-climate-adaptation-strategies-three-cities-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":23.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":23.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8048343,"mean":6.8380049254832,"rank":351296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7696496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8048343,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171467,"mean":7.6536091819954,"rank":9574,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":161871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171467,"percentile":94},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112105,"mean":10.546436862199,"rank":8248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":103841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112105,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2728,"mean":16.822957829116,"rank":317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":2411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2728,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
