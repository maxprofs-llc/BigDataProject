Twenty-five of the affected people were treated at the Baptist Hospital Shaki. The patients presented with rapidly progressing swelling of the left arm with associated fever and other constitutional symptoms few hours after inoculation with the vaccine. Some of the patients developed gangrene of the affected limb, five of them went into coma and died. Poor hygiene and improper handling of vaccine as well as contamination of vaccine from the source are possible causes. A review of vaccine delivery strategies especially at local community levels; sound training, supervision of vaccinators and health education are strongly recommended to prevent reoccurrence of similar reactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce5c","authors":["S A Oyelami","O D Olaleye","C O Oyejide","S A Omilabu","B A Fatunla"],"first_seen_on":"2014-07-16T07:30:22+00:00","issns":["1018-0532"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Revue roumaine de virologie","last_mentioned_on":1405495800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7756161"],"pmid":"7756161","title":"Severe post-vaccination reaction to 17D yellow fever vaccine in Nigeria.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/severe-postvaccination-reaction-17d-yellow-fever-vaccine-nigeria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4032273,"mean":5.0563113323429,"rank":3224289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":100069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4032273,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100989,"mean":7.9066428090466,"rank":80293,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100989,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Social Sciences":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"LK":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Severe post-vaccination reaction to 1...
