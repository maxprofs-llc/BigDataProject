However, postoperative infection associated with internal fixation devices (intramedullary nails, plates, and screws) remains a significant complication, and it is technically difficult to fix multiple fragmented bony fractures using internal fixation devices. In addition, drilling in the bone to install devices can lead to secondary fracture, bone necrosis associated with postoperative infection. In this study, we developed bone clip type internal fixation device using three- dimensional (3D) printing technology. Standard 3D model of the bone clip was generated based on computed tomography (CT) scan of the femur in the rat. Polylacticacid (PLA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and silk were used for bone clip material. The purpose of this study was to characterize 3D printed PLA, PLA\/HA, and PLA\/HA\/Silk composite bone clip and evaluate the feasibility of these bone clips as an internal fixation device. Based on the results, PLA\/HA\/Silk composite bone clip showed similar mechanical property, and superior biocompatibility compared to other types of the bone clip. PLA\/HA\/Silk composite bone clip demonstrated excellent alignment of the bony segments across the femur fracture site with well-positioned bone clip in an animal study. Our 3D printed bone clips have several advantages: (1) relatively noninvasive (drilling in the bone is not necessary), (2) patient-specific design (3) mechanically stable device, and (4) it provides high biocompatibility. Therefore, we suggest that our 3D printed PLA\/HA\/Silk composite bone clip is a possible internal fixation device.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccd","authors":["Yeung Kyu Yeon","Hae Sang Park","Jung Min Lee","Ji Seung Lee","Young Jin Lee","Md.
