Patients were categorized as current, previous, or never smokers (NS) at listing for LT. Additionally, smokers were stratified by pack-years of tobacco exposure. Events included patient death, cardiovascular events, and de novo cancers. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate survival. A complete cause of death analysis is provided, as well as a detailed tumor registry.\nCurrent (n = 279) and previous smokers (n = 323) were more likely to have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at transplant (25%, 29% vs 18% [NS], P < 0.001), and these 2 groups had higher HCC recurrence rates (21%, 14% vs 11% [NS], P = 0.18). De novo non-HCC CA was higher for current and previous smokers, compared to NS (18%, 16% vs 12% [NS], P = 0.05). Among those with de novo CA (n = 180), the 2 smoking groups were more likely to have non-skin CA (60%, 54% vs 27% [NS], P < 0.001). Patient survival at 10 years was worse for current smokers than the other study groups (55% vs 70%, P < 0.01). These results were largely mirrored with increased tobacco exposure.\nThe LT outcomes are uniformly worse for patients with a history of smoking, and the risk of negative events increases with increasing tobacco use. Smokers have higher rates of HCC and recurrence, de novo cancer, and worse long-term survival.\nThis study summarizes the clinical outcomes for 1275 LT patients over 10 years, analyzing the impact of pre transplant recipient tobacco use. There are 47% of patients with a history of smoking. Because of demonstrated higher cancer rates and decreased survival, patients with a significant smoking history should be carefully scrutinized for liver transplantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008bed","authors":["Mangus, Richard S","Fridell, Jonathan A","Kubal, Chandrashekhar A","Loeffler, Amanda L","Krause, Audrey A","Bell, Jeffrey A","Tiwari, Sarika","Tector, Joseph"],"doi":"10.1097\/tp.0000000000000671","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T19:46:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-6080","0041-1337"],"issue":"9","journal":"Transplantation","last_mentioned_on":1447776558,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26308417","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/transplantjournal\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/Worse_Long_term_Patient_Survival_and_Higher_Cancer.20.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26308417?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26308417","pubdate":"2015-08-27T22:00:33+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Worse Long-term Patient Survival and Higher Cancer Rates in Liver Transplant Recipients With a History of Smoking.","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/worse-longterm-patient-survival-higher-cancer-rates-liver-transplant-recipients-history-smoking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6577121,"mean":6.1012807651375,"rank":3127331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1963583,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6577121,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199781,"mean":9.4755962358596,"rank":108799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":70930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199781,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2500,"mean":1.9745994397759,"rank":1034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2500,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":3.8135593220339,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
