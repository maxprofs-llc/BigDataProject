She was found to have a large central corneal ulcer with a small hypopyon. On the following day, after initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient had improved symptoms but now had a 2-mm hypopyon that was distinctly pink in color. Cultures were positive for Serratia marcescens. A pink hypopyon, a rare occurrence, alerted the authors to a causative agent of Enterobacteriacae, either Klebsiella or Serratia. Immediate and intensive treatment was subsequently initiated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000085f","authors":["James A Stefater","Durga S Borkar","James Chodosh"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12348-015-0041-4","first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T22:39:35+00:00","issns":["1869-5760"],"journal":"Journal of Ophthalmic Inflammation and Infection","last_mentioned_on":1440771180,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12348-015-0041-4","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4385303\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.joii-journal.com\/content\/pdf\/s12348-015-0041-4.pdf","pmid":"25861400","pubdate":"2015-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"title":"Pink hypopyon in a patient with Serratia marcescens corneal ulceration","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pink-hypopyon-patient-serratia-marcescens-corneal-ulceration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560729,"mean":6.3849504158434,"rank":1041956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":4509277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560729,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194920,"mean":9.4295426920926,"rank":45143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":149546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194920,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":1.314808988764,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":84,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.34375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Bacteria can colour our insides!","url":"http:\/\/www.rosincerate.com\/2015\/08\/bacteria-can-colour-our-insides.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ResearchBloggingAllEnglish+%28Research+Blogging+-+English+-+All+Topics%29","license":"public","citation_ids":[4447764,4447765,4447766,4370634,1556641,4447767,4447769,3803181,109428,1442293,4447770],"posted_on":"2015-08-28T14:13:00+00:00","summary":"Included in the vast array of molecules put together by bacteria are pigments, with a blotch of colour often marking the presence of a large bacterial population in nature.
