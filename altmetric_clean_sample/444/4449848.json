Additionally, MET is activated as a compensatory pathway in the presence of EGFR blockade, thus resulting in a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibitors.\nWe have investigated the impact of HGF and MET expression, MET activation (phosphorylation), MET gene status, and MET-activating mutations on cetuximab sensitivity in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) patients.\nA single-institution retrospective analysis was performed in 57 patients. MET overexpression was detected in 58\u00a0% patients, MET amplification in 39\u00a0% and MET activation (p-MET) in 30\u00a0%. Amplification was associated with MET overexpression. Log-rank testing showed significantly worse outcomes in recurrent\/metastatic, MET overexpressing patients for progression-free survival and overall survival. Activation of MET was correlated with worse PFS and OS. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, p-MET was an independent prognostic factor for PFS. HGF overexpression was observed in 58\u00a0% patients and was associated with MET phosphorylation, suggesting a paracrine activation of the receptor.\nHGF\/MET pathway activation correlated with worse outcome in recurrent\/metastatic HNSCC patients. When treated with a cetuximab-based regimen, these patients correlated with worse outcome. This supports a dual blocking strategy of HGF\/MET and EGFR pathways for the treatment of patients with recurrent\/metastatic HNSCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Madoz-G\u00farpide, Juan","Zazo, Sandra","Chamizo, Cristina","Casado, Victoria","Caram\u00e9s, Cristina","Gav\u00edn, Eduardo","Crist\u00f3bal, Ion","Garc\u00eda-Foncillas, Jes\u00fas","Rojo, Federico"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12967-015-0633-7","first_seen_on":"2015-08-29T12:25:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1441311893,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/282?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed:%20JournalOfTranslationalMedicine-LatestArticles%20(Journal%20of%20Translational%20Medicine)","http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/282?utm_content=bufferdd731&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/13\/1\/282","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4552997\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/pdf\/s12967-015-0633-7.pdf","pmid":"26319934","pubdate":"2015-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"282","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Activation of MET pathway predicts poor outcome to cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/activation-met-pathway-predicts-poor-outcome-cetuximab-patients-recurrent-metastatic-head-neck-cance"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5974186,"mean":6.0510067910469,"rank":1415184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":3937020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5974186,"percentile":65},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195958,"mean":9.4348091571109,"rank":60437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":133238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195958,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1558,"mean":4.1374283879255,"rank":309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":1209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1558,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":2.5678125,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
