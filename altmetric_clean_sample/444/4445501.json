Patients were equally randomized as group 1 and 2 with 60 patients each. Ice was applied as an anesthetic method 5 minutes before procedure to the patients in group 1. Patients in group 2 were applied 10 mL of 2% lidocaine gel 10 minutes before procedure. Twelve core biopsy procedure was performed for all patients. The pain level was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS).\nMedian pain score was 3.5 (1-8) in group 1 and 5 (1-8) in group 2. There is significantly difference between groups regarding the mean sense of pain level during the procedure. (p=0.007) There was also no difference in complications between two groups about presence and duration of macroscopic hematuria and rectal bleeding.\nIntrarectal ice application prior to TRUS prostate biopsy has an effect on reducing pain. Development of new techniques about cold effect or ice can make this method more useful and decrease complication rates.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61c3cf058f6100077dc","authors":["Caliskan, Baris","Mutlu, Nazim"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T10:52:56+00:00","issns":["1677-6119"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Brazilian Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1440759702,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25928515?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25928515","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Intrarectal ice application prior to transrectal prostate biopsy: a prospective randomised trial accessing pain and collateral effects.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrarectal-ice-application-prior-transrectal-prostate-biopsy-prospective-randomised-trial-accessing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560729,"mean":6.3849504158434,"rank":4630231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560729,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194920,"mean":9.4295426920926,"rank":156185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194920,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":0.89489795918367,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":0.90833333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/637216202419388416","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4445501],"posted_on":"2015-08-28T10:52:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
