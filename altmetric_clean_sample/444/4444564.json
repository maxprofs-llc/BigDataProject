This study proposes a culture-centered approach to understanding how structural changes contribute to a reduction in positive health perception and behavior as active duty servicewomen transition to a veteran status. Results suggest during the process of disengagement from military cultural norms, women veterans' health care prevention service utilization decreases, and their physical and mental health decreases through the transition. These findings highlight the need for widely available and culturally appropriate programs to meet the needs of this unique patient population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013f4","authors":["Villagran, Melinda","Ledford, Christy J W","Canzona, Mollie Rose"],"doi":"10.1080\/10810730.2015.1018619","first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T03:01:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1087-0415"],"journal":"Journal of Health Communication","last_mentioned_on":1441627200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26305865","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/10810730.2015.1018619","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10810730.2015.1018619"],"pmid":"26305865","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Women's Health Identities in the Transition From Military Member to Service Veteran","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/womens-health-identities-transition-military-member-service-veteran"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6298319,"mean":5.808944756679,"rank":4649996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":934651,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6298319,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195519,"mean":9.4269309219611,"rank":134885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195519,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":559,"mean":8.0221254480287,"rank":462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":559,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":20.431428571429,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":6}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Women's Health Identities in the Transition From Military Member to Service Veteran.","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=763369133772006&id=208472345928357","license":"public","citation_ids":[4444564],"posted_on":"2015-08-26T22:00:00+00:00","summary":"\"As servicewomen leave behind their military rank and status to become veterans, they must learn to effectively navigate a fragmented structure of care and communicate their health care needs.
