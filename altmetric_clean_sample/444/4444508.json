Of 6162 patients under follow-up, 204 (3.3%) patients were on ADD therapy. The majority of patients were treated with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (67.4%), while only 17.0% of patients received tricyclic anti-depressants. Twice as many female patients used ADDs compared with males (4.4 vs. 2.2%, P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients on ADDs increased with disease complexity (P < 0.0001) and patient age (P < 0.0001). Over a median follow-up of 11.1 years, 507 (8.2%) patients died. After propensity score matching, ADD use was found to be significantly associated with worse outcome in male ACHD patients [hazard ratio 1.44 (95% confidence interval 1.17-1.84)]. There was no evidence that this excess mortality was directly related to ADD therapy, QT-prolongation, or malignant arrhythmias. However, males taking ADDs were also more likely to miss scheduled follow-up appointments compared with untreated counterparts, while no such difference in clinic attendance was seen in females.\nThe use of ADD therapy in ACHD relates to gender, age, and disease complexity. Although, twice as many female patients were on ADDs, it were their male counterparts, who were at increased mortality risk on therapy. Furthermore, males on ADDs had worse adherence to scheduled appointments suggesting the need for special medical attention and possibly psychosocial intervention for this group of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007331","authors":["Gerhard-Paul Diller","Andrea Br\u00e4utigam","Aleksander Kempny","Anselm Uebing","Rafael Alonso-Gonzalez","Lorna Swan","Sonya V.
