The aqueous extract inhibited yeast \u03b1-glucosidase with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 28.6 \u03bcg\/mL. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of several compounds, including one cyanogenic glycoside [prunasin (1)], five flavonoids [(-)-epi-catechin (2), hyperoside (3), isoquercetin (4), quercitrin (5) and quercetin-3-O-(6''-benzoyl)-\u03b2-galactoside (6)] and two simple aromatic compounds [picein (7) and methylarbutin (8)]. The most active compound was 6 with IC50 values of 30 \u03bcM in the case of yeast \u03b1-glucosidase, and 437 \u03bcM in the case of the mammalian enzyme. According to the kinetic analyses performed with rat and yeast enzymes, this compound behaved as mixed-type inhibitor; the calculated inhibition constants (Ki) were 212 and 50 \u03bcM, respectively. Molecular docking analyses with yeast and mammalian \u03b1-glucosidases revealed that compound 6 bind differently to these enzymes. Altogether, the results of this work suggest that preparations of V. corymbosa might delay glucose absorption in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000422e","authors":["Flores-Bocanegra, Laura","P\u00e9rez-V\u00e1squez, Araceli","Torres-Piedra, Mariana","Bye, Robert","Linares, Edelmira","Mata, Rachel"],"doi":"10.3390\/molecules200815330","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T13:21:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1420-3049"],"issue":"8","journal":"Molecules","last_mentioned_on":1458153515,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26307962?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26307962"],"pmid":"26307962","pubdate":"2015-08-27T22:00:44+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"\u03b1-Glucosidase Inhibitors from Vauquelinia corymbosa.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/%CE%B1glucosidase-inhibitors-vauquelinia-corymbosa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7401456,"mean":6.433764966749,"rank":1249309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6145980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7401456,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227568,"mean":8.7898556293312,"rank":47188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":180161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227568,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3200,"mean":2.1540125039075,"rank":192,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":3005,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3200,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":1.2873471502591,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
