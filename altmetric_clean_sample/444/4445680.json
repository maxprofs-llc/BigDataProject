We examined Th1\/Th2\/Th17 cytokines produced from three-dimensionally cultured breast cancer tissues and related them with patient clinical profiles.\n21 tumor tissues and 9 normal tissues surgically resected from breast cancer patients were cultured in thermoreversible gelatin polymer-containing medium. Tissue growth and Th1\/Th2\/Th17 cytokine concentrations in the culture medium were analyzed and were related with hormone receptor expressions and patient clinical profiles.\nIL-6 and IL-10 were expressed highly in culture medium of both cancer and normal tissues. However, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-17A were not detected in the supernatant of the three-dimensionally cultured normal mammary gland and are seemed to be specific to breast cancer tissues. The growth abilities of hormone receptor-negative cancer tissues were significantly higher than those of receptor-positive tissues (P=0.0383). Cancer tissues of stage \u2265IIB patients expressed significantly higher TNF-\u03b1 levels as compared with those of patients with stage <IIB (P=0.0096).\nThe tumor tissues resected from breast cancer patients can grow in the three-dimensional thermoreversible gelatin polymer culture system and produce Th1\/Th2\/Th17 cytokines. Hormone receptor-positive cancer tissues showed less growth ability. TNF-\u03b1 is suggested to be a biomarker for the cancer stage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc8a","authors":["Kiyomi, Anna","Makita, Masujiro","Ozeki, Tomoko","Li, Na","Satomura, Aiko","Tanaka, Sachiko","Onda, Kenji","Sugiyama, Kentaro","Iwase, Takuji","Hirano, Toshihiko"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tranon.2015.06.004","first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T11:04:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1936-5233"],"issue":"4","journal":"Translational Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1440759847,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26310378?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26310378","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Characterization and Clinical Implication of Th1\/Th2\/Th17 Cytokines Produced from Three-Dimensionally Cultured Tumor Tissues Resected from Breast Cancer Patients.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-clinical-implication-th1th2th17-cytokines-produced-threedimensionally-cultured-tumo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5560701,"mean":6.3849309187677,"rank":4630205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5560701,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194916,"mean":9.4297133724957,"rank":156177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194916,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":2.093675,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.325,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/637219101824253952","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4445680],"posted_on":"2015-08-28T11:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":718},"tweet_id":"637219101824253952"}]}}
