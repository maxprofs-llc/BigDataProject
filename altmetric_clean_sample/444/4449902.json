Control of the primary tumor was not a criterion: we included both oligo-recurrence and sync-oligometastases.\nA total of 34 patients were enrolled in the study. The median overall survival was 20 months (range=1-119 months) and the 2-year overall survival rate was 65.7% [95% confidence interval (CI)=48.3-83.1%]. The two-year local control rate was 79.1% (95% CI=62.4-95.8%). Stratified by oligo status, the 2-year overall survival rate of the oligo-recurrence group was 68.5% (95% CI=50.3-86.7%), while that of the group with sync-oligometastases was 50.0% (95% CI=1.0-99.0%). These rates were significantly different (p=0.037). No grade 5 early- or late-adverse events were recognized in the current study.\nSBRT for pulmonary oligometastases achieved good results and there was no serious adverse event. The oligo-recurrence group, in particular, achieved fairly good results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Niibe, Yuzuru","Yamashita, Hideomi","Sekiguchi, Kenji","Takahashi, Wataru","Shiraishi, Kenshiro","Okuma, Kae","Terahara, Atsuro","Kawamori, Jiro","Nakagawa, Keiichi"],"first_seen_on":"2015-08-29T12:50:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1791-7530"],"issue":"9","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1439666018,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26254386"],"pmid":"26254386","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Results for Pulmonary Oligometastases: A Two-Institution Collaborative Investigation.","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereotactic-body-radiotherapy-results-pulmonary-oligometastases-twoinstitution-collaborative-invest"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5484049,"mean":6.3683118320617,"rank":4562203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5484049,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194934,"mean":9.4121540016314,"rank":156048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1532,"mean":2.9751456564337,"rank":1050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1532,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.6185882352941,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
