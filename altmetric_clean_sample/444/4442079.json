In March 2013, our pediatric burn unit existing in this setting established an electronic registry of all patients. The authors analyzed the registry to determine overall mortality rates and predictors of mortality, including that of underweight status and body part burned. The secure electronic database of all admissions was reviewed for age, gender, weight, burn percentage (TBSA%), body part burned, cause\/place of injury, length of stay, underweight status, surgery performed, reason for discharge, and mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated with mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were also analyzed. A total of 211 cases (59.7% male) admitted from March 2013 to June 2014 were reviewed. The median age, %TBSA, and length of stay were 2.0 years (1.3-3.3), 8.0% (5.0-13.4), and 8.5 days (4-14). The overall mortality rate was 15\/211 (7.1%). Most injuries were unintentional (93.8%) scalds (85.3%) occurring in the home (98.1%). Two factors were significantly associated with mortality in the final multivariable model: %TBSA (odds ratio = 1.31 for 1% increase in %TBSA; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.46) and younger age (odds ratio = 0.20; 0.07-0.63). This study characterizes mortality among patients at a pediatric burn unit serving a rural population in the developing world. The majority of pediatric burns were unintentional scalds occurring in the home. %TBSA and lower age were the strongest predictors of mortality. Burn location and underweight status were not independent predictors of mortality. Overall mortality was 7.1%. These data are applicable to improving outcomes for patients in this burn unit and similar settings of its kind.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fe","authors":["Chelidze, Khatiya I","Lim, Christopher C","Peck, Robert N","Giiti, Geofrey","Leahy, Nicole","Yurt, Roger","Gallagher, James J","Mitchell, Katrina B","Chelidze, Khatiya I.","Lim, Christopher C.","Peck, Robert N.","Rabbitts, Angela","Gallagher, James J.","Mitchell, Katrina B."],"doi":"10.1097\/bcr.0000000000000286","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T13:10:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1559-0488","1559-047X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of burn care & research","last_mentioned_on":1456961055,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/9000\/00000\/Predictors_of_Mortality_Among_Pediatric_Burn.98658.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Predictors_of_Mortality_Among_Pediatric_Burn.16.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Predictors_of_Mortality_Among_Pediatric_Burn.16.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/9000\/00000\/Predictors_of_Mortality_Among_Pediatric_Burn.98658.pdf","pmid":"26284634","pubdate":"2015-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Predictors of Mortality Among Pediatric Burn Patients in East Africa.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/burncareresearch\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Predictors_of_Mortality_Among_Pediatric_Burn.16.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/predictors-mortality-among-pediatric-burn-patients-east-africa-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7342039,"mean":6.3783632029643,"rank":5293653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1791174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7342039,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227189,"mean":8.7754433068649,"rank":141724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":71012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227189,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1185,"mean":1.9173986486486,"rank":482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1185,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.8180555555556,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JBurnCareOnline\/statuses\/636888389355048960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4442079],"posted_on":"2015-08-27T13:09:59+00:00","author":{"name":"JrnlBurnCareResearch","url":"http:\/\/www.burncareresearch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1581665833\/bcr_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Burn Care & Research provides the latest information on advances in burn prevention, research, education, delivery of acute care, and research.","id_on_source":"JBurnCareOnline","tweeter_id":"388301935","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":102},"tweet_id":"636888389355048960"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JBurnCareOnline\/statuses\/705171864977408000","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4442079],"posted_on":"2016-03-02T23:24:08+00:00","author":{"name":"JrnlBurnCareResearch","url":"http:\/\/www.burncareresearch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1581665833\/bcr_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Burn Care & Research provides the latest information on advances in burn prevention, research, education, delivery of acute care, and research.","id_on_source":"JBurnCareOnline","tweeter_id":"388301935","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":102},"tweet_id":"705171864977408000"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Predictors of Mortality Among Pediatric Burn Patients in Eas... : Journal of Burn Care & Research","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=963473730407273&id=167412800013374","license":"public","citation_ids":[4442079],"posted_on":"2016-03-02T23:24:15+00:00","summary":"Little is known about the outcomes of pediatric burn patients in resource-limited and rural locations of the developing world.
