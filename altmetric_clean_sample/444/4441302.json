We characterized the c.503T>C polymorphism in the human KLRB1 gene (Killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily B, member 1) coding for the cell surface receptor CD161. CD161 is expressed by subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and the great majority of CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells, acting as inhibitory receptor in the latter population. Genotyping a cohort of 118 healthy individuals revealed 40% TT homozygotes, 46% TC heterozygotes, and 14% carriers of CC. There was no difference in the frequency of CD161 expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between the different genotypes. However, the frequency of CD161+ NK cells was significantly decreased in CC carriers as compared to TT homozygotes. c.503T>C causes an amino acid exchange (p.Ile168Thr) in an extracellular loop of the CD161 receptor, which is regarded to be involved in binding of its ligand Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT1). Binding studies using soluble LLT1-Fc on 293 transfectants over-expressing CD161 receptors from TT or CC carriers suggested diminished binding to the CC variant. Furthermore, triggering of CD161 either by LLT1 or anti-CD161 antibodies inhibited NK cell activation less effectively in cells from CC individuals than cells from TT carriers. These data suggest that the c.503T>C polymorphism is associated with structural alterations of the CD161 receptor. The regulation of NK cell homeostasis and activation apparently differs between carriers of the CC and TT variant of CD161.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Rother, Sascha","Hundrieser, Joachim","Pokoyski, Claudia","Kollrich, Sonja","Borns, Katja","Blasczyk, Rainer","Poehnert, Daniel","Klempnauer, J\u00fcrgen","Schwinzer, Reinhard"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0135682","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T10:11:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"8","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1440678513,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26309225?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26309225?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26309225","pubdate":"2015-08-27T22:00:19+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The c.503T>C Polymorphism in the Human KLRB1 Gene Alters Ligand Binding and Inhibitory Potential of CD161 Molecules.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/c503tc-polymorphism-human-klrb1-gene-alters-ligand-binding-inhibitory-potential-cd161-molecules"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557318,"mean":6.3845700736537,"rank":2751500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2638525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557318,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194343,"mean":9.3725932119666,"rank":95613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":90207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194343,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95988,"mean":9.6476854574057,"rank":49560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":41382,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95988,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6102,"mean":8.2112440583511,"rank":3181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":2562,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6102,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
