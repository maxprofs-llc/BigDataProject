The mean age was 11.8 years (range, 8 to 15 years), and the mean follow-up period was 28 months (range, 12 to 44 months). A posterior arthroscopic TCC resection was performed. The plantar footprint, subtalar motion, pain, and the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot scale score were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were used to classify the coalition according to the Rozansky classification, to measure the percentage of involvement of the surface area, and to determine the degree of hindfoot valgus. Postoperative CT scans at 1 year (n\u00a0= 15) and 3 years (n\u00a0= 5) were used to assess recurrences. Patient satisfaction was also evaluated.\nThe TCC distribution according to the Rozansky classification was type I in 7 cases, type II in 3, type III in 3, and type IV in 3. In all cases the arthroscopic approach enabled complete coalition resection. All patients increased by at least 1 stage in the footprint classification and showed clinical subtalar mobility after surgery. All patients showed a statistically significant improvement in pain after surgery except for 1 patient in whom complex regional pain syndrome developed (P < .001). The mean American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society score was 56.8 (range, 45 to 62) preoperatively versus 90.9 (range, 36 to 100) postoperatively, showing a statistically significant increase (P < .001). Preoperative CT scans showed that all TCCs involved the medial subtalar joint facet, with mean involvement of 40.8% of the articular surface. All postoperative CT scans showed complete synostosis resections with no recurrences at final follow-up. At final follow-up, all patients were either satisfied (n\u00a0= 4 [27%]) or extremely satisfied (n\u00a0= 10 [67%]) with the outcome, except the 1 patient (7%) in whom complex regional pain syndrome developed.\nArthroscopic TCC resection provides good outcomes (symptom relief and restoration of subtalar motion), with no recurrence of the coalition.\nLevel IV, therapeutic case series.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b2c","authors":["Kn\u00f6rr, Jorge","Soldado, Francisco","Menendez, Mariano E","Domenech, Pedro","Sanchez, Mikel","Sales de Gauzy, J\u00e9r\u00f4me","Jorge Kn\u00f6rr","Francisco Soldado","Mariano E.
