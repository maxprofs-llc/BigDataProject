The main mechanism of the efficacy was antiproliferative action on the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). To understand more about the mechanisms that are responsible for the efficacy, we examined minutely the effects of IFN-\u03b2 on the apoptosis and growth of vascular SMC and endothelial cells (EC). IFN-\u03b2 enhanced SMC apoptosis in serum starved medium. Conversely, EC apoptosis induced by serum and growth factor deprivation was inhibited by IFN-\u03b2. The induction of SMC apoptosis and anti-apoptotic effect on EC linked to the expression of pro-apoptotic bax mRNA and caspase-3 activities. Anti-apoptotic bcl-2 mRNA was also up-regulated in EC. IFN-\u03b2 inhibited SMC growth in a dose dependent manner. However, the growth of EC was rather enhanced by a low dose of IFNs. The antiproliferative effect on SMC associated with the activation of p21 and increase of G0\/G1 arrested cells. The growth stimulation on EC was considered to link with increase of S and G2\/M phase cells. SMC produced IFN-\u03b2 in response to various stimulants. However, IFN-\u03b2 was not induced in EC. These suggested that endogenous IFN-\u03b2 from SMC may act on EC and affect to EC functions. In this study, it was clarified that IFN-\u03b2 enhances SMC apoptosis and inhibits the EC apoptosis, and stimulates the EC growth. These effects were considered to contribute to a cure against hyperplastic arterial diseases as the mechanisms in the efficacy of IFN-\u03b2.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef6b2a83ee09648b50a3","authors":["Sano, Emiko","Tashiro, Shinya","Tsumoto, Kouhei","Ueda, Takuya"],"doi":"10.1089\/biores.2014.0052","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T10:22:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2164-7844"],"issue":"1","journal":"BioResearch Open Access","last_mentioned_on":1440670834,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26309778?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26309778","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Differential Effects of IFN-\u03b2 on the Survival and Growth of Human Vascular Smooth Muscle and Endothelial Cells.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-effects-ifn%CE%B2-survival-growth-human-vascular-smooth-muscle-endothelial-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557237,"mean":6.3845638835577,"rank":2944097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1880231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557237,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194345,"mean":9.3724342403162,"rank":105333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":69842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194345,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96,"mean":10.8736,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":9.8445714285714,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/statuses\/636845755198648321","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4441418],"posted_on":"2015-08-27T10:20:34+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":173},"tweet_id":"636845755198648321"}]}}
