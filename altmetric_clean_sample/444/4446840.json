There are many other clinical features that help differentiate these two hyperkinetic disorders. Whereas behavioral and antidopaminergic therapies are most effective in the management of tics, clonazepam, other anticonvulsants, and serotonergic drugs are often used to control myoclonic movements. Botulinum toxin may also be helpful in focal tics and in segmental forms of myoclonus. DBS plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of these disorders, particularly when they are generalized and are disabling despite optimal medical therapy. \u00a9 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ecf","authors":["Jankovic, Joseph"],"doi":"10.1002\/mds.26414","endpage":"1573","first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T15:40:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1531-8257"],"issue":"11","journal":"Movement Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1440806795,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/mds.26414"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mds.26414\/pdf","pmid":"26315614","pubdate":"2015-09-01T22:02:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1566","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Therapeutic Developments for Tics and Myoclonus","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/therapeutic-developments-tics-myoclonus"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6434920,"mean":5.9861428437558,"rank":4758496,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":950367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6434920,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198160,"mean":9.3553652672854,"rank":136230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":38785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198160,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1705,"mean":5.0788110328638,"rank":1382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1705,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":5.3410410958904,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
