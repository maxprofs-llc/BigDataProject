Trials that excluded PLWH were further investigated to evaluate if the exclusion was justified by scientific evidence.\nWe identified 56 multicentre open clinical trials in lymphoma including 46 interventional trials. People living with HIV were excluded from 32 interventional trials (70%). We identified a biologically valid reason (a potential increased risk of greater immunosuppression) for excluding PLWH from one trial and possibly for one optional arm in another study.\nThere was no scientific or safety justification for excluding PLWH from most lymphoma clinical trials included on the NIHR portfolio. A clear justification for excluding PLWH was not offered in the available protocols. The exclusion of PLWH should be explicitly justified on scientific grounds in protocols to minimise stigmatisation.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 27 August 2015; doi:10.1038\/bjc.2015.301 www.bjcancer.com.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000243d","authors":["Serena Venturelli","Alessia Dalla Pria","Katrina Stegmann","Paul Smith","Mark Bower"],"doi":"10.1038\/bjc.2015.301","first_seen_on":"2015-08-28T06:33:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0007-0920","1532-1827"],"journal":"British Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1442595047,"links":["http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/bjc\/rss\/aop\/~3\/z3yt1uu6-lA\/bjc.2015.301","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/bjc\/journal\/v113\/n6\/full\/bjc2015301a.html"],"pmid":"26313666","pubdate":"2015-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"The exclusion of people living with HIV (PLWH) from clinical trials in lymphoma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/exclusion-people-living-hiv-plwh-clinical-trials-lymphoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6365090,"mean":5.8387021777703,"rank":515502,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5843285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6365090,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196731,"mean":9.4243712092717,"rank":26291,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":170161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196731,"percentile":86},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2997,"mean":8.440937917223,"rank":469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":2520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2997,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90,"mean":10.740988764045,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":67,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
