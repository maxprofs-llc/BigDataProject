Methodologies are available to measure emissions, but application in extensive grazing environments is challenging. A micrometeorological methodology for estimating herd-scale emissions using an indirect open-path spectroscopic technique and an atmospheric dispersion model is described. The methodology was deployed on five cattle properties across Queensland and Northern Territory, with measurements conducted during two occasions at one site. On each deployment, data were collected every 10 min for up to 7 h a day over 4 to 16 days. To increase the atmospheric concentration of CH4 to measurable levels, cattle were confined to a known area around water points from ~0800 to 1600 h, during which time measurements of wind statistics and line-averaged CH4 concentration were taken. Filtering to remove erroneous data accounted for 35% of total observations. For five of the six deployments CH4 emissions were within the expected range of 0.4 to 0.6 g\/kg BW. At one site, emissions were ~2 times expected values. There was small but consistent variation with time of day, although for some deployments measurements taken early in the day tended to be higher than at the other times. There was a weak linear relationship (R 2=0.47) between animal BW and CH4 emission per kg BW. Where it was possible to compare emissions in the early and late dry season at one site, it was speculated that higher emissions at the late dry season may have been attributed to poorer diet quality. It is concluded that the micrometeorological methodology using open-path lasers can be successfully deployed in extensive grazing conditions to directly measure CH4 emissions from cattle at a herd scale.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069d8","authors":["Tomkins, N W","Charmley, E"],"doi":"10.1017\/s1751731115001688","first_seen_on":"2015-08-27T10:00:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1751-732X"],"journal":"animal","last_mentioned_on":1440669994,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9916153&fileId=S1751731115001688"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S1751731115001688","pmid":"26290115","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"1","title":"Herd-scale measurements of methane emissions from cattle grazing extensive sub-tropical grasslands using the open-path laser technique","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/herdscale-measurements-methane-emissions-cattle-grazing-extensive-subtropical-grasslands-using-openp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5557318,"mean":6.3845700736537,"rank":2751500,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2638525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5557318,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194344,"mean":9.3725514168249,"rank":95613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":90207,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194344,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":2.1758121212121,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.5604166666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
