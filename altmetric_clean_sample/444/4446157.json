As regulatory T cells produce the immunomodulatory molecule adenosine, our aim here was to assess the potential of adenosine removal to revert the suppression of anti-HIV responses exerted by regulatory T cells. The experimental setup consisted of ex vivo cocultures of T and dendritic cells, to which adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes adenosine, was added. In cells from healthy individuals, adenosine hydrolysis decreased CD4(+)CD25(hi) regulatory T cells. Addition of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, an adenosine receptor agonist, significantly decreased CD4(+)CD25(lo) cells, confirming a modulatory role of adenosine acting via adenosine receptors. In autologous cocultures of T cells with HIV-1-pulsed dendritic cells, addition of adenosine deaminase led to a significant decrease of HIV-1-induced CD4(+)CD25(hi) forkhead box p3(+) cells and to a significant enhancement of the HIV-1-specific CD4(+) responder T cells. An increase in the effector response was confirmed by the enhanced production of CD4(+) and CD8(+) CD25(-)CD45RO(+) memory cell generation and secretion of Th1 cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3 and IL-15 and chemokines MIP-1\u03b1\/CCL3, MIP-1\u03b2\/CCL4, and RANTES\/CCL5. These ex vivo results show, in a physiologically relevant model, that adenosine deaminase is able to enhance HIV-1 effector responses markedly. The possibility to revert regulatory T cell-mediated inhibition of immune responses by use of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes adenosine, merits attention for restoring T lymphocyte function in HIV-1 infection.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007d16","authors":["Naval-Macabuhay, Isaac","Casanova, V\u00edctor","Navarro, Gemma","Garc\u00eda, Felipe","Le\u00f3n, Agathe","Miralles, Laia","Rovira, Cristina","Martinez-Navio, Jos\u00e9 M","Gallart, Teresa","Mallol, Josefa","Gatell, Jos\u00e9 M","Llu\u00eds, Carme","Franco, Rafael","McCormick, Peter J","Climent, N\u00faria","Isaac Naval-Macabuhay","V\u00edctor Casanova","Gemma Navarro","Felipe Garc\u00eda","Agathe Le\u00f3n","Laia Miralles","Cristina Rovira","Jos\u00e9 M.
