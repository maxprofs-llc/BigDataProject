Clinical assessments, \u03b1-galactosidase A (\u03b1-GalA) activities, glycosphingolipid substrate levels, and in vitro mutation expression were used to categorize p.D322E as a classic FD mutation and p.I232T as a later-onset FD mutation. In vitro expression revealed that p.D322E and p.I232T had \u03b1-GalA activities of 1.4% and 14.9% of the mean wild-type activity, respectively. Family A men had markedly decreased \u03b1-GalA activity and childhood-onset classic manifestations, except for angiokeratoma and cornea verticillata. Family B men had residual \u03b1-GalA activity and developed FD manifestations in adulthood. Despite these differences, all family A and family B men >30 years of age had left ventricular hypertrophy, which was mainly asymmetrical, and had similar late gadolinium enhancement patterns. Ischemic stroke and severe white matter lesions were more frequent among family A men, but neither family A nor family B men had overt renal disease. Family A and family B heterozygotes had less severe or no clinical manifestations.\nMen with classic or later-onset FD caused by GLA missense mutations developed prominent and similar cardiovascular disease at similar ages, despite markedly different \u03b1-GalA activities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eca","authors":["Berglind Adalsteinsdottir","Runolfur Palsson","Robert J.
