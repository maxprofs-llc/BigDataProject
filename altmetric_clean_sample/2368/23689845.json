The benefits of observation medicine have been documented in these two age groups: Based on the success of observation medicine, and recognizing the growth of these special populations, it is likely that observation medicine will be expanding in the future, especially within the pediatric and geriatric populations. Future studies should be able to provide further evidence regarding the value of observation medicine in these two diverse population age groups.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007268","authors":["Mace, Sharon E."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.emc.2017.03.011","first_seen_on":"2017-08-12T18:21:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0733-8627"],"issue":"3","journal":"Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1502562094,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28711131?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28711131","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Care of Special Populations in an Observation Unit","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/care-special-populations-observation-unit-pediatrics-geriatrics"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":7227001,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179294,"mean":12.466153257517,"rank":146495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179294,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":377,"mean":4.3342925531915,"rank":337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":377,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.85,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PEMUpdates\/statuses\/896436512606134272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23689845],"posted_on":"2017-08-12T18:21:34+00:00","author":{"name":"PEM Updates","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3077019133\/002e2b27f97368b10a18a0e458ba4336_normal.jpeg","description":".","id_on_source":"PEMUpdates","tweeter_id":"903773208","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":438},"tweet_id":"896436512606134272"}]}}
