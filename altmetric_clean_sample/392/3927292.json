Individuals 59 to 71 years of age were selected from electoral rolls. High blood pressure at baseline was defined as systolic blood pressure > or =160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > or =95 mm Hg. Cognitive decline was defined as a drop of 4 points or more on the Mini-Mental State Examination between baseline and the 4-year assessment.\nThere is an association between high blood pressure at baseline and cognitive decline at the 4-year assessment (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.0). In participants with high blood pressure, the risk of cognitive decline was 4.3 (95% CI, 2.1 to 8.8) in those without antihypertensive therapy and 1.9 (95% CI, 0.8 to 4.4) in those being treated. In participants with high blood pressure both at baseline and at the 2-year assessment, the risk for untreated participants was 6.0 (95% CI, 2.4 to 15.0) compared with 1.3 (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.9) in treated participants.\nHigh blood pressure was associated with cognitive decline. In individuals with high blood pressure, cognitive decline occurred in a relatively short time period and the risk was highest in untreated hypertensive patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Christophe Tzourio","Carole Dufouil","Pierre Ducimeti\u00e8re","Annick Alp\u00e9rovitch","for the EVA Study Group"],"doi":"10.1212\/wnl.53.9.1948","first_seen_on":"2015-04-21T12:05:02+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1526-632X","0028-3878"],"issue":"9","journal":"Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1429617813,"links":["http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/53\/9\/1948.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/content\/53\/9\/1948.full.pdf","pmid":"10599763","pubdate":"1999-12-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cognitive decline in individuals with high blood pressure A longitudinal study in the elderly","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cognitive-decline-individuals-high-blood-pressure-longitudinal-study-elderly-eva-study-group-epidemi-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5021372,"mean":5.9474792900214,"rank":2666731,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1681220,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5021372,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155234,"mean":9.7894706280238,"rank":90283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":48407,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155234,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7217,"mean":10.393984201774,"rank":4976,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":1459,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7217,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":19.756995215311,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
