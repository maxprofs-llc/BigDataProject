Prescription painkillers, stimulants and sedatives were the primary substances of interest.\nParticipants were recruited from nightlife venues in New York using time-space sampling. Subjects completed a mixed-methods assessment at project research offices. The data presented here are from a subsample of 70 qualitative interviews conducted during the baseline assessment.\nWe identified experimentation and a \"work hard, play hard\" ethos as key motivations for misusing prescription drugs and argue that these motivations are specific, though not necessarily unique, to the participants' social location as young adults. These findings highlight the role of life stage and social context in the misuse of prescription drugs.\nFuture studies of prescription drug misuse should pay attention to the larger social contexts in which users are embedded and, therefore, make decisions about how and why to misuse. Moving beyond the very broad concepts of \"recreation\" and \"self-medication\" presently established in the research, policies targeting young adults may want to tailor intervention efforts based on motivations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003bb1","authors":["Amy LeClair","Brian C.
