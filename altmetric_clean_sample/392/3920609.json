In this scientific context, market data report a significant growth of the biopesticide segment. Acquisition of new technologies by multinational Ag-tech companies is the center of the present industrial environment. This trend is in line with the requirements of new regulations on Integrated Pest Management. After a few decades of research on microbial pest management dominated by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), novel bacterial species with innovative modes of action are being discovered and developed into new products. Significant cases include the entomopathogenic nematode symbionts Photorhabdus spp. and Xenorhabdus spp., Serratia species, Yersinia entomophaga, Pseudomonas entomophila, and the recently discovered Betaproteobacteria species Burkholderia spp. and Chromobacterium spp. Lastly, Actinobacteria species like Streptomyces spp. and Saccharopolyspora spp. have gained high commercial interest for the production of a variety of metabolites acting as potent insecticides. With the aim to give a timely picture of the cutting-edge advancements in this renewed research field, different representative cases are reported and discussed.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f0b","authors":["Luca Ruiu"],"doi":"10.3390\/insects6020352","first_seen_on":"2015-04-18T14:35:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2075-4450"],"issue":"2","journal":"Insects","last_mentioned_on":1445029113,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4450\/6\/2\/352\/htm","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26463190?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2075-4450\/6\/2\/352\/pdf","pmid":"26463190","pubdate":"2015-10-16T20:58:53+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Insect Pathogenic Bacteria in Integrated Pest Management","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/insect-pathogenic-bacteria-integrated-pest-management-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6258277,"mean":5.9890807040159,"rank":2752746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3339958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6258277,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156896,"mean":9.9715823831226,"rank":80856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":69601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156896,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105,"mean":3.7358653846154,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":51,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":26.796,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
