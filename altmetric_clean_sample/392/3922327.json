Clinicians find this goal difficult to address, as there are no measures that provide a breakdown of making friends into functional steps. In addition, research on friendship has traditionally focused on characteristics and quality of friendships rather than the friend-making process as a whole. A goal menu, comprised of a variety of steps that address the goal of making friends, would provide guidance to clinicians challenged with this goal in practice.\nTo develop an understanding of the friend-making process as a first step towards the development of a goal menu for the goal of making friends.\nA literature review, youth focus group and expert clinician semi-structured interviews and consultation were used to generate a comprehensive data set. Established qualitative methods were used to sort and group the data into categories. A thematic analysis of the categories was performed.\nAnalysis revealed four themes integral to the friend-making process: person factors influencing friend-making, making friend-making a priority, opportunity for friend-making and motivation to make friends. An additional theme identified as occasionally involved in the process was a little bit of luck in making friends.\nThe themes generated by this research indicate that actionable target areas exist for the somewhat abstract notion of friend-making and the authors recommend that clinicians explore beyond person factors when addressing the goal of making friends. As a next step, the identified themes will provide the foundation for a goal menu, ultimately enabling clinicians to address the goal of making friends in a more efficient and effective manner.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002508","authors":["Gerhardt, S.","McCallum, A.","McDougall, C.","Keenan, S.","Rigby, P.","Gerhardt, S","McCallum, A","McDougall, C","Keenan, S","Rigby, P"],"doi":"10.1111\/cch.12251","endpage":"1029","first_seen_on":"2015-04-19T23:59:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1365-2214"],"issue":"6","journal":"Child: Care, Health & Development","last_mentioned_on":1429487912,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cch.12251\/abstract;jsessionid=92949FCA064DD1E3F5CB1E30FDB22125.f02t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/cch.12251&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/cch.12251"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cch.12251\/pdf","pmid":"25891293","pubdate":"2015-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1018","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"The goal of making friends for youth with disabilities: creating a goal menu","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/goal-making-friends-youth-disabilities-creating-goal-menu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364045,"mean":5.9833578812467,"rank":4473465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1659446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364045,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163808,"mean":9.7561496883528,"rank":109190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":46975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163808,"percentile":28},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":451,"mean":4.3891377777778,"rank":274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":451,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":3.7191304347826,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
