Implementation of REMS was considered likely to reduce ESA use and increase red blood cell transfusions. We aimed to quantify ESA and transfusion use pre- and post-REMS.\nA retrospective data analysis was conducted using the Medicare 5% Sample Database from 2008 through 2011. Patients were 66\u00a0years of age or older and had lung and\/or breast cancers along with chemotherapy-induced anaemia. Patients initiated chemotherapy in pre-REMS and post-REMS periods (1Q2008 through 4Q2009 and 1Q2010 through 4Q2011, respectively). Logistic regression was used to evaluate differences in proportions of patients receiving ESAs and transfusions pre-REMS and post-REMS.\nThe pre-REMS group included 1526 patients and the post-REMS group included 1689 patients. ESA use in patients with lung cancer decreased 30\u00b72% from pre- to post-REMS and 33\u00b71% in patients with breast cancer. Both decreases were statistically significant. Transfusion rates increased 22\u00b71% from the pre-REMS period to the pre-REMS period in patients with breast cancer (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001), but there was no statistically significant change over time in patients with lung cancer.\nErythropoiesis-stimulating agent use decreased in patients with both lung and breast cancer (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001), and transfusion rates increased significantly post-REMS in patients with breast cancer (P\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001) but not in those with lung cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d06","authors":["Hollingsworth, K.","Romney, M.
