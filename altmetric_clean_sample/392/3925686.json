Data from 96 young adults were used. The mean age and body mass index were 24.0\u00b13.3years old, and 36.9\u00b17.9, respectively. There was a positive association between physical activity self-efficacy and leisure-time physical activity in African Americans, but not in non-African Americans. Better problem solving was associated with fewer depressive symptoms regardless of gender and race.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005738","authors":["Cha, EunSeok","Braxter, Betty J","Kim, Kevin H","Lee, Heeyoung","Akazawa, Margeaux K","Talman, Molly S","Pinto, Melissa D","Faulkner, Melissa Spezia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apnu.2015.04.002","first_seen_on":"2015-04-21T00:50:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0883-9417","1532-8228"],"issue":"5","journal":"Archives of Psychiatric Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1429577392,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=3&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychiatricnursing.org%2Farticle%2FS0883-9417%2815%2900070-9%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=yapnu-site","http:\/\/www.psychiatricnursing.org\/article\/S0883-9417(15)00070-9\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.psychiatricnursing.org\/article\/S0883941715000709\/pdf","pmid":"26397427","pubdate":"2015-09-24T22:00:37+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","psychiatry"],"title":"Preventive strategies to reduce depressive symptoms in overweight and obese young adults","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preventive-strategies-reduce-depressive-symptoms-overweight-obese-young-adults-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5021506,"mean":5.947680814023,"rank":3552108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":823063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5021506,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155231,"mean":9.789179243703,"rank":114160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":25199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155231,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":274,"mean":1.7650549450549,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":274,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.1195652173913,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":4}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
