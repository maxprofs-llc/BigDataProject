Furthermore, H7N9 has already generated various mutations such as neuraminidase R294K mutation which could make the anti-influenza oseltamivir less effective or ineffective. In this regard, it is urgent to develop new effective anti-H7N9 drug. In this study, we used the general H7N9 neuraminidase and oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus neuraminidase as the acceptors and employed the small molecules including quercetin, chlorogenic acid, baicalein, and oleanolic acid as the donors to perform the molecular docking for exploring the binding abilities between these small molecules and neuraminidase. The results showed that quercetin, chlorogenic acid, oleanolic acid, and baicalein present oseltamivir-comparable high binding potentials with neuraminidase. Further analyses showed that R294K mutation in neuraminidase could remarkably decrease the binding energies for oseltamivir, while other small molecules showed stable binding abilities with mutated neuraminidase. Taken together, the molecular docking studies identified four potential inhibitors for neuraminidase of H7N9, which might be effective for the drug-resistant mutants.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003acc","authors":["Liu, Zekun","Zhao, Junpeng","Li, Weichen","Wang, Xinkun","Xu, Jingxuan","Xie, Jin","Tao, Ke","Shen, Li","Zhang, Ran"],"doi":"10.1155\/2015\/480764","first_seen_on":"2015-04-18T19:00:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1748-6718","1748-670X"],"journal":"Computational & Mathematical Methods in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1429178604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25861376?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2015\/480764","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25861376?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25861376","pubdate":"2015-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"title":"Molecular Docking of Potential Inhibitors for Influenza H7N9.","type":"article","volume":"2015","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-docking-potential-inhibitors-influenza-h7n9-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5002950,"mean":5.926907258501,"rank":2305785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2570493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5002950,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153820,"mean":9.8002576014668,"rank":74915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":73749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153820,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232,"mean":1.4024588744589,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
