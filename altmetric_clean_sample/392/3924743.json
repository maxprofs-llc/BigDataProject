Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies to H. pylori were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and HLA typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction of DNA amplification. We included 72 non-uveitis patients and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in the study.\nOf the 106 patients with AAU, 41 (38.7%) were HLA-B27-positive, and 45 (42.5%) were seropositive for H. pylori. Patients with HLA-B27-positive AAU had a significantly lower prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity compared to those with HLA-B27-negative AAU and healthy controls (24.4% vs. 53.8%, p = 0.003; 24.4% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.004, respectively). In the non-uveitis group, however, HLA-B27-positive patients exhibited similar H. pylori seropositivity prevalence to HLA-B27-negative patients and healthy controls (45.5% vs. 55.7%, p = 0.529; 45.5% vs. 57.1%, p = 0.497, respectively). In multivariate analysis, a low prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity was significantly associated with HLA-B27-positive AAU (odds ratio = 0.340, 95% confidence interval 0.135-0.855, p = 0.022).\nOur results suggest an inverse association between H. pylori seropositivity and HLA-B27-positive AAU. Further investigation of this association is needed, given the low prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity observed in patients with HLA-B27-positive AAU.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jeong Hun Bae","Joon Mo Kim"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0123924","first_seen_on":"2015-04-20T19:16:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"4","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1429557300,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0123924"],"pmid":"25894610","pubdate":"2015-04-22T22:03:59+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Rate of  Helicobacter pylori  Seropositivity in a Group of Korean Patients with HLA-B27-Associated Acute Anterior Uveitis","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rate-helicobacter-pylori-seropositivity-group-korean-patients-hlab27associated-acute-anterior-uveiti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5017152,"mean":5.9416359675058,"rank":4195100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5017152,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154834,"mean":9.7952135139151,"rank":129721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154834,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88448,"mean":9.2495910771423,"rank":74522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88448,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5341,"mean":8.7421048689139,"rank":4618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5341,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
