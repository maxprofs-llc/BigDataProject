They are sometimes associated with extrapyramidal side effects including Parkinsonism. We report a case of generalized anxiety disorder on treatment with SSRI (fluoxetine \/ sertraline) who developed irreversible Parkinsonism. SSRI are known to cause reversible or irreversible motor disturbances through pathophysiological changes in basal ganglion motor system by altering the dopamine receptors postsynaptically. Clinician should keep risk benefit ratio in mind and change of antidepressant of different class may be considered. Case is reported to alert physicians to possibility of motor system damage while treating with SSRI.","authors":["Dixit, Siddharth","Khan, Shahbaj A","Azad, Sudip","Siddharth Dixit","Shahbaj A Khan","Sudip Azad"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2015\/11394.5583","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T00:43:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2249-782X","2249782X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1502684595,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25859504","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4378786\/","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4378786\/"],"pmid":"25859504","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"JCDR Research & Publications Private Limited","startpage":"VD01","title":"A Case of SSRI Induced Irreversible Parkinsonism","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/jcdr.net\/article_fulltext.asp?issn=0973-709x&year=2015&volume=9&issue=2&page=VD01&issn=0973-709x&id=5583","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-ssri-induced-irreversible-parkinsonism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.6},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
