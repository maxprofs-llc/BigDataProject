A sequential fluorescence in-situ hybridization protocol based on two successive hybridization rounds was performed on sperm samples from one t(13;22) and ten t(13;14) carriers. Patient inclusion criteria included the presence of a positive interchromosomal effect (ICE). In the first round, numerical abnormalities for chromosomes 15\/22, 18, 21, X and Y were analysed. In the second round, the segregation outcome of the rearranged chromosomes was evaluated in the numerically abnormal spermatozoa detected in the first round, as well as in randomly assessed spermatozoa. Aneuploid spermatozoa showed statistical differences in all segregation modes when compared with randomly assessed spermatozoa: alternate (50.7% versus 84.3%), adjacent (36.6% versus 14.6%) and 3:0 (10.2% versus 1%). Diploid\/multiple disomic spermatozoa showed differences in alternate (3.7% versus 84.3%) and 3:0 (67.6% versus 1%). We concluded that in Robertsonian translocation carriers that exhibit ICE, numerically abnormal spermatozoa preferentially contain unbalanced segregation products. This might be explained by heterosynapsis acting as a rescue mechanism that would lead to aberrant recombination, which is a predisposing factor for non-disjunction events.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f61000345c","authors":["Godo, Anna","Blanco, Joan","Vidal, Francesca","Sandalinas, Mireia","Garcia-Guix\u00e9, Elena","Anton, Ester"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.rbmo.2015.04.003","first_seen_on":"2015-04-19T05:59:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["14726483","1472-6483","1472-6491"],"journal":"Reproductive BioMedicine Online","last_mentioned_on":1430188241,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1472648315001583?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rbmojournal.com%2Farticle%2FS1472-6483%252815%252900158-3%2Fabstract&code=rbmo-site"],"pmid":"25985997","pubdate":"2015-05-20T22:05:15+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Altered segregation pattern and numerical chromosome abnormalities interrelate in spermatozoa from Robertsonian translocation carriers","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-segregation-pattern-numerical-chromosome-abnormalities-interrelate-spermatozoa-robertsonian"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5032690,"mean":5.9703653518035,"rank":3323030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1500709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5032690,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":154153,"mean":9.8036320125592,"rank":104212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":42598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":154153,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":618,"mean":3.3462333873582,"rank":386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":618,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.0597272727273,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
