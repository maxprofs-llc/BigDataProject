Anyone else?"],"citation":{"abstract":"To determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety and effectiveness of intravesical instillation of mistletoe extract after transurethral resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.\nIn this single group dose escalation study, patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were treated with weekly instillations of mistletoe extract for 6 weeks. 4 weeks before instillation therapy all patients underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumors. During this procedure a marker tumor was left. 12 weeks after start of instillation therapy a transurethral resection of the marker tumor or biopsy of the former marker tumor location was done so that patients were tumor free when entering the follow up until week 48. During follow up clinical assessment, safety laboratory and cystoscopy was done every 12 weeks.\n36 patients were treated with increasing doses of mistletoe extract. We found no dose limiting toxicities up to a dose of 675 mg of plant extract. Besides local reactions, we saw hints that pyrexia may occur. All adverse events were well manageable. After 12 weeks a marker tumor remission rate of 55.6 % (95 % CI: 38.1 % to 72.1 %). was achieved. After one year, a recurrence rate of 26.3 % (95% CI: 9.1 to 51.2 %) was observed.\nIn this study intravesical instillation of mistletoe extract in treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer showed to be safe and well tolerated. Promising data on efficacy were observed and will be further investigated in a phase III study.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f12","authors":["Rose, Achim","El-Leithy, Tarek","Vom Dorp, Frank","Zakaria, Ahmed","Eisenhardt, Andreas","Tschirdewahn, Stephan","R\u00fcbben, Herbert"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.juro.2015.04.073","first_seen_on":"2015-04-22T00:06:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0022-5347","1527-3792"],"journal":"The Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1452724925,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jurology.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-5347%252815%252903849-5%2Fabstract%3FhootPostID%3Dbdaac4ccd960b18405c632c9199e1d06%26rss%3Dyes&code=juro-site","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)03849-5\/abstract?rss=yes&hootPostID=beca438f943095b477bcb2cc5149e350","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jurology.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-5347%252815%252903849-5%2Fabstract%3FhootPostID%3Db000df8f2ad6f6a3e02fc66ba975fd96%26rss%3Dyes&code=juro-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jurology.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-5347%252815%252903849-5%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=juro-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jurology.com%2Farticle%2FS0022-5347%252815%252903849-5%2Fabstract%3FhootPostID%3D1def6201a9d7d6d5900f8c4063705826%26rss%3Dyes&code=juro-site","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)03849-5\/abstract?rss=yes&hootPostID=a31e54cd06e6dcf88cb3e8de0c88e9ec","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347(15)03849-5\/abstract","http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022-5347%2815%2903849-5\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jurology.com\/article\/S0022534715038495\/pdf","pmid":"25910967","pubdate":"2015-04-26T22:00:30+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Mistletoe Plant Extract in Patients with Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: Results of a Phase Ib\/IIa Single Group Dose Escalation Study","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mistletoe-plant-extract-patients-nonmuscle-invasive-bladder-cancer-results-phase-ibiia-single-group"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":1441771,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5503710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":198861,"mean":8.8530302222671,"rank":53638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":144617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":198861,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7146,"mean":4.1339266620014,"rank":1267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":5853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7146,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":3.3163793103448,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":294,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
