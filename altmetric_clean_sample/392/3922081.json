Hyperspectral imaging was then performed on a population newly presenting with diabetic foot ulcers to a specialist clinic, and associations were sought with healing at 12 and 24 weeks.\nThe correlation between the results of hyperspectral imaging and blood gas analysis was strong (r=0.994). A total of 43 patients (mean \u00b1 sd age 62.7\u00b112.2 years; 31 men, 12 women; 37 with Type 2 diabetes, six with Type 1 diabetes) with foot ulcers were included in the prospective clinical study and underwent hyperspectral imaging within 16 days of presentation. In all, 26 ulcers healed within 12 weeks and 28 within 24 weeks. There was a negative association between tissue oxygenation assessed by hyperspectral imaging at baseline and healing by 12 weeks (P=0.009), and this was observed in both infected and non-infected ulcers. There was a significant positive correlation between oxygenation assessed by hyperspectral imaging and time to healing (P=0.03). No correlations were observed at 24 weeks.\nThese findings suggest that hyperspectral imaging may predict healing in routine practice. The fact that the correlation between hyperspectral imaging and healing was negative could be explained by hyperspectral imaging being a measure of oxygenation of haemoglobin and there may be an inverse relationship between this and the oxygenation of extravascular tissue in people with neuropathy and\/or microvascular disease.
