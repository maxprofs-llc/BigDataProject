The present investigation examines in two studies the association between specific sub-types of driving misconduct, i.e., unintentional mistakes and deliberate rule violations with psychopathic characteristics, with a focus on the role of levels of fear and anxiety in aberrant driving. Findings support the hypotheses that fearlessness, i.e., the bold, unemotional aspect of psychopathic traits, characterizes drivers who engage in frequent deliberate driving code violations, whereas the more impulsive\/antisocial aspect of psychopathy, associated with higher levels of fear and anxiety, is more characteristic of drivers who engage in unintentional mistakes. Fearless features are also associated with higher self-reported driving misconduct and accidents. Study 2 conceptually replicated this finding by showing that mistakes are positively related to high sensitivity to punishment, while violations are negatively related to it. Findings are discussed in light of psychopathy theory and in relation to prevention and intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","authors":["Panayiotou, Georgia"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2015.03.007","first_seen_on":"2015-04-21T15:49:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-2057","00014575"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1450552023,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25819475","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25819475?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001457515000810","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.aap.2015.03.007","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001457515000810?via%3Dihub","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25819475?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25819475","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"The bold and the fearless among us: Elevated psychopathic traits and levels of anxiety and fear are associated with specific aberrant driving behaviors.","type":"article","volume":"79","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bold-fearless-among-elevated-psychopathic-traits-levels-anxiety-fear-associated-specific-aberrant-dr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.15,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7924974,"mean":6.7034884830464,"rank":1241386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6681532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7924974,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":204423,"mean":8.9767822445726,"rank":43211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":161109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":204423,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2486,"mean":5.5406189134809,"rank":355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":2130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2486,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":3.0542950819672,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
