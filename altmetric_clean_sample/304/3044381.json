This study included 6,413 participants enrolled in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (mean follow-up: 4.8\u00b13.8 years). Weight discrepancy was defined as measured weight minus self-identified good weight. MetSyn was defined using standard definitions. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incident MetSyn, by weight discrepancy category, were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The multivariable-adjusted HR for MetSyn was 3.48 (95% CI=2.48-4.86) for those who maintained higher weight discrepancy over time compared to individuals with lower weight discrepancy. Additional adjustment for body mass index did not change this interpretation (HR=3.44; 95% CI=2.46-4.82). Weight discrepancy may be a useful screening characteristic and target for future interventions to further reduce the risk of chronic weight-related disorders, included MetSyn.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f610006120","authors":["Wirth MD","Blake CE","H\u00e9bert JR","Sui X","Blair SN"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bodyim.2014.11.003","endpage":"32","first_seen_on":"2015-01-07T18:13:30+00:00","funders":["nci","niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["17401445","1740-1445"],"journal":"Body Image","last_mentioned_on":1427842903,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1740144514001454","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25544742"],"pmid":"25544742","pubdate":"2014-12-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"28","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Metabolic syndrome and discrepancy between actual and self-identified good weight: Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study.","type":"article","volume":"13C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-syndrome-discrepancy-between-actual-selfidentified-good-weight-aerobics-center-longitudina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561235,"mean":6.0788887803725,"rank":2711297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3700694,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561235,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206293,"mean":8.1451471312511,"rank":86616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":113020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206293,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":337,"mean":10.295773809524,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":337,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":29.357,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
