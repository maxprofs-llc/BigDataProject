It consists of two separated channel arrays: detection channel array and sensing channel array, which are connected by a group of parallel ITO BPEs on a glass substrate. Besides, two parallel ITO strips are fabricated at the two sides of BPE array and employed as driving electrodes. After Au films are electrochemically deposited on the cathodes of the BPE array, nanobioprobes including biorecognition elements (aptamer or antibody) and a novel electrochemical tag, which is synthesized by doping thionine in silica nanoparticles (Th@SiO2 NPs), are introduced into the cathodes by immunoreaction or DNA hybridization. The Th@SiO2 coupled nanobioprobes as both recognition probes and signal amplification indicators could mediate the ECL signals of Ru(bpy)3(2+)\/tripropylamine (TPA) on the anodes of BPE array through faradaic reaction due to the charge neutrality of BPE. Thus, multiplex detection of cancer biomarkers (adenosine triphosphate (ATP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) and thrombin) is realized by forming specific sensing interfaces onto the cathodic poles of BPEs in different sensing channels and reported by the ECL images of the Ru(bpy)3(2+)\/TPA system on the anodic poles of BPEs in detection channels. The results demonstrate that this visual ECL platform enables sensitive detection with excellent reproducibility, which may open a new door toward the development of simple, sensitive, cost-effective, and high throughput detection methods on biochips.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Mei-Sheng Wu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac502989f","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T18:37:28+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1442367305,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac502989f?hootPostID=fa3e730cbe0621c994aca81f8a48691e&","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25457383?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25457383","pubdate":"2014-12-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Visual Electrochemiluminescence Detection of Cancer Biomarkers on a Closed Bipolar Electrode Array Chip.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visual-electrochemiluminescence-detection-cancer-biomarkers-closed-bipolar-electrode-array-chip"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6351877,"mean":5.8398139318209,"rank":4458856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1659016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6351877,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":192687,"mean":8.3255360742349,"rank":121495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":62365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":192687,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5774,"mean":3.132646804088,"rank":3219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":2257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5774,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":401,"mean":2.9682,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":401,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
