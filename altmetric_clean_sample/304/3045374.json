THC did not antagonise the noncannabinoid verapamil, capsaicin or the CB1 receptor agonist CP55,940. 6 THC (10 and 100 microM) inhibited endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDHF)-mediated responses to carbachol in a manner similar to the gap junction inhibitor 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid. 7 These data show that THC causes vasorelaxation through activation of K+ channels and inhibition of Ca2+ channels, and this involves non-CB1, non-TRPV1 but G-protein-coupled receptors. In G0, THC does not cause relaxation and at high concentrations causes contractions. Importantly, THC antagonises the effects of anandamide, possibly through inhibition of EDHF activity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["O'Sullivan SE","Kendall DA","Randall MD"],"doi":"10.1038\/sj.bjp.0706218","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T01:40:48+00:00","issns":["0007-1188"],"issue":"4","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1420681218,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/15821751\/"],"pmcid":"PMC1576168","pmid":"15821751","pubdate":"2005-04-12T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The effects of Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol in rat mesenteric vasculature, and its interactions with the endocannabinoid anandamide.","type":"article","volume":"145","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-delta9tetrahydrocannabinol-rat-mesenteric-vasculature-interactions-endocannabinoid-anandamid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4711551,"mean":5.4428615576047,"rank":1970364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2678513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4711551,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156747,"mean":8.4262244522988,"rank":59723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":94782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156747,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2083,"mean":3.9496829971182,"rank":1063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2083,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":61,"mean":1.5391666666667,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":61,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
