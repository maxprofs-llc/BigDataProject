Adults are free-living, whereas late first to fourth instars are sessile on the plant. All known species of whitefly parasitoids belong to Hymenoptera; two genera, Encarsia and Eretmocerus, occur worldwide, and others are mostly specific to different continents. All parasitoid eggs are laid in-or in Eretmocerus, under-the host. They develop within whitefly nymphs and emerge from the fourth instar, and in Cales, from either the third or fourth instar. Parasitized hosts are recognized by conspecifics, but super- and hyperparasitism occur. Dispersal flights are influenced by gender and mating status, but no long-range attraction to whitefly presence on leaves is known. Studies on En. formosa have laid the foundation for behavioral studies and biological control in general. We review past and ongoing studies of whitefly parasitoids worldwide, updating available information on species diversity, biology, behavior, tritrophic interactions, and utilization in pest management.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002297","authors":["Tong-Xian Liu","Liu TX","Stansly PA","Gerling D"],"doi":"10.1146\/annurev-ento-010814-021101","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T12:14:45+00:00","issns":["0066-4170"],"journal":"Annual Review of Entomology","last_mentioned_on":1420714500,"links":["http:\/\/www.annualreviews.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1146\/annurev-ento-010814-021101"],"pmid":"25341095","pubdate":"2014-10-24T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Whitefly Parasitoids: Distribution, Life History, Bionomics, and Utilization.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whitefly-parasitoids-distribution-life-history-bionomics-utilization"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4711672,"mean":5.4417966083809,"rank":826887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3864004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4711672,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156757,"mean":8.4157077751411,"rank":33451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":122881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156757,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":5.6412386058981,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":3.7375,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
