The growth medium (tryptic soy broth [TSB] or modified Welshimer's broth [MWB] at 32 degrees C) influenced the amount of biofilm formed; maximum biofilms were formed in MWB by six strains and in TSB by the remaining two strains. This result suggests that the growth medium is critical in development of L. monocytogenes biofilm. This organism also produced biofilms on stainless steel chips. Biofilm formation on these chips was observed following growth in TSB at 4, 20, and 37 degrees C. After 20 h of incubation at 20 or 37 degrees C, the cell density was approximately 10(6) CFU per chip, and after 4 days incubation at 4 degrees C, the cell density was 10(5) CFU per chip. L. monocytogenes strain Scott A biofilm formation on stainless steel chips was visualized using scanning electron microscopy, which revealed dense aggregates of cells held together by meshlike webbing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002db1","authors":["Moltz AG","Martin SE"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T05:16:55+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Journal of Food Protection","last_mentioned_on":1420694198,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15690808"],"pmid":"15690808","pubdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth","nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Formation of biofilms by Listeria monocytogenes under various growth conditions.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formation-biofilms-listeria-monocytogenes-under-various-growth-conditions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4711672,"mean":5.4417966083809,"rank":3818421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145455,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4711672,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156757,"mean":8.4156991630306,"rank":123353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156757,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":685,"mean":3.0795263157895,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":685,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.037375,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
