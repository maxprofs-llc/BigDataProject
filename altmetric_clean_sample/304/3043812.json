Preliminary evidence suggests that openness and agreeableness are associated with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). However, how personality is related to IADLs remains unclear. We aimed to determine how personality factors predict performance of IADLs, which we hypothesized, was because of executive functioning (EF).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b54","authors":["Puente, Antonio Nicolas","Lindbergh, Cutter A.","Miller, L.
