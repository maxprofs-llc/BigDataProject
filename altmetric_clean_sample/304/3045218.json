Cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and osteoblasts were stimulated with adiponectin (1 or 10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml(-1)) or IL-1\u03b2 (0.1\u2009ng\u2009ml(-1)) in the presence or absence of hypoxia for 24\u2009h. The protein expression patterns were examined by analyzing culture supernatants using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Adiponectin significantly stimulated the production of VEGF, MMP-1 and MMP-13 in osteoblasts but not in endothelial cells, whereas it significantly stimulated the production of IL-6 and IL-8 in both endothelial cells and osteoblasts. The increase in VEGF production induced by adiponectin was significantly greater than that induced by IL-1\u03b2. The production of IL-6 and IL-8 in adiponectin-stimulated endothelial cells was approximately 10-fold higher than that in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated endothelial cells; in osteoblasts, adiponectin-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was approximately twofold higher than that induced by IL-1\u03b2. In addition, IL-8 production in endothelial cells was approximately sevenfold higher than in osteoblasts. However, IL-6 levels were similar between the two cell types, suggesting that adiponectin may be involved in the production of IL-8 in endothelial cells, which may have an important role in neutrophil recruitment to arthritic joints. Furthermore, the increases in protein expression induced by adiponectin were differentially regulated by hypoxia. In conclusion, adiponectin has a more important role than does IL-1\u03b2 in the production of mediators that drive synovitis and joint destruction in endothelial cells and osteoblasts at physiological concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073b5","authors":["Yeon-Ah Lee","Hye-In Ji","Sang-Hoon Lee","Seung-Jae Hong","Hyung-In Yang","Myung Chul Yoo","Kyoung Soo Kim"],"doi":"10.1038\/emm.2013.141","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T00:36:57+00:00","issns":["1226-3613","2092-6413"],"journal":"Experimental and Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1420753657,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/emm\/journal\/v46\/n1\/full\/emm2013141a.html"],"pmid":"24434628","pubdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e72","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"The role of adiponectin in the production of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF and MMPs in human endothelial cells and osteoblasts: implications for arthritic joints","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-adiponectin-production-il6-il8-vegf-mmps-human-endothelial-cells-osteoblasts-implications-arthr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8037326,"mean":6.8221638928343,"rank":3766861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4091646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8037326,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237607,"mean":7.9088623014572,"rank":98094,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":131965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237607,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":2.9484457478006,"rank":159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0230769230769,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
