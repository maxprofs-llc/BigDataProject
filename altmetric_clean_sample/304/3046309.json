The neuropeptide oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) have been implicated in social cognition and behavior. The present study - for the first time applying a multi-level epigenetic approach - investigates the role of OXTR gene methylation in categorical, dimensional and intermediate neuroendocrinological\/neural network phenotypes of social anxiety. One-hundred and ten unmedicated patients with SAD and matched 110 controls were analyzed for OXTR methylation by direct sequencing of sodium bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from whole blood. Furthermore, OXTR methylation was investigated regarding SAD-related traits (Social Phobia Scale, SPS; Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, SIAS), salivary cortisol response during the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and amygdala responsiveness to social phobia related verbal stimuli using fMRI. Significantly decreased OXTR methylation particularly at CpG Chr3:8 809 437 was associated with (1) the categorical phenotype of SAD (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.535), (2) increased SPS and SIAS scores (p<0.001), (3) increased cortisol response to the TSST (p=0.02), and (4) increased amygdala responsiveness during social phobia related word processing (right: pcorr<0.001; left: pcorr=0.005). Assuming that decreased OXTR methylation confers increased OXTR expression, the present finding may reflect a compensatory upregulation for pathologically reduced oxytocin levels or a causally relevant increased OXTR activation in SAD and related traits. OXTR methylation patterns might thus serve as peripheral surrogates of oxytocin tone and aid in establishing accessible biomarkers of SAD risk allowing for indicated preventive interventions and personalized treatment approaches targeting the oxytocin system.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 07 January 2015. doi:10.1038\/npp.2015.2.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a7","authors":["Christiane Ziegler","Udo Dannlowski","David Br\u00e4uer","Stephan Stevens","Inga Laeger","Hannah Wittmann","Harald Kugel","Christian Dobel","Ren\u00e9 Hurlemann","Andreas Reif","Klaus-Peter Lesch","Walter Heindel","Clemens Kirschbaum","Volker Arolt","Alexander L Gerlach","J\u00fcrgen Hoyer","J\u00fcrgen Deckert","Peter Zwanzger","Katharina Domschke","Ziegler C","Dannlowski U","Br\u00e4uer D","Stevens S","Laeger I","Wittmann H","Kugel H","Dobel C","Hurlemann R","Reif A","Lesch K","Heindel W","Kirschbaum C","Arolt V","Gerlach AL","Hoyer J","Deckert J","Zwanzger P","Domschke K"],"doi":"10.1038\/npp.2015.2","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T10:04:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1740-634X","0893-133X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuropsychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1459334126,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25563749","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25563749?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/npp.2015.2","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/npp\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/abs\/npp20152a.html","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/npp\/rss\/aop\/~3\/bK4uG3HE9So\/npp.2015.2","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25563749?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25563749","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychopharmacology","neurology"],"title":"Oxytocin Receptor Gene Methylation: Converging Multilevel Evidence for a Role in Social Anxiety","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/oxytocin-receptor-gene-methylation-converging-multilevel-evidence-role-social-anxiety-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7465518,"mean":6.4808427461848,"rank":566318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":6894701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7465518,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233227,"mean":7.7412041967878,"rank":22513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":210550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233227,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3145,"mean":9.697677480916,"rank":514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3145,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":17.913010309278,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":8,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
