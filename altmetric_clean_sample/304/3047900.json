I'm sure the polysaccharide components in some seaweeds wuld work!"],"citation":{"abstract":"Significant interest has emerged in the introduction of food packaging materials manufactured from biodegradable polymers that have the potential to reduce the environmental impacts associated with conventional packaging materials. Current technologies in active packaging enable effective antimicrobial (AM) packaging films to be prepared from biodegradable materials that have been modified and\/or blended with different compatible materials and\/or plasticisers. A wide range of AM films prepared from modified biodegradable materials have the potential to be used for packaging of various food products. This review examines biodegradable polymers derived from polysaccharides and protein-based materials for their potential use in packaging systems designed for the protection of food products from microbial contamination. A comprehensive table that systematically analyses and categorizes much of the current literature in this area is included in the review.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52b3cf058f610003fe9","authors":["Kuorwel KK","Cran MJ","Sonneveld K","Miltz J","Bigger SW","Kuorwel, Kuorwel K.","Cran, Marlene J.","Sonneveld, Kees","Miltz, Joseph","Bigger, Stephen W."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1750-3841.2011.02102.x","endpage":"R102","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T19:06:11+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1750-3841"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Food Science","last_mentioned_on":1420760897,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1750-3841.2011.02102.x\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1750-3841.2011.02102.x\/pdf","pmid":"21535854","pubdate":"2011-04-14T23:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"startpage":"R90","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Antimicrobial Activity of Biodegradable Polysaccharide and Protein\u2010Based Films Containing Active Agents","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antimicrobial-activity-biodegradable-polysaccharide-proteinbased-films-containing-active-agents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6344504,"mean":5.9797799692115,"rank":1432333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":4908772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6344504,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196879,"mean":8.1309329838785,"rank":54970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":141780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196879,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1080,"mean":6.0129286376274,"rank":305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1080,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":1.8875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Ph.
