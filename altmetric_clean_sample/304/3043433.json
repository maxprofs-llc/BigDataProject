Whether na\u00efve and central memory CD4(+) T-cell subsets contribute more or equally to alloimmune responses are still unclear in human. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the alloreactive response of purified na\u00efve, central memory, and effector memory CD4(+) T-cell subsets in HLA identical setting. By coculturing monocyte-derived dendritic cells and purified CD4(+) T-cell subsets, from healthy HLA-identical male and female sibling pairs, we found that na\u00efve CD4(+) CCR7(+) CD45RA(+) T cells developed the highest proliferative response upon stimulation by minor histocompatibility antigens and were progressively driven to produce high levels of interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6. Comparatively, the central memory CD4(+) CCR7(+) CD45RA(neg) subset proliferated to a lower extent and produced very low amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines while the CCR7(neg) effector memory CD4(+) subset was unresponsive. This study demonstrates the superior capacity of na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells to mount a primary alloreactive response as compared to central memory T cells. Their proliferative response associated with a pro-inflammatory differentiation makes them potentially acute GVHD inducers. These in vitro results in line with what we have observed in clinical studies and may also lend support to approaches of partial selective T-cell depletion for GVHD prevention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002834","authors":["Ch\u00e9rel M","Choufi B","Trauet J","Cracco P","Dessaint JP","Yakoub-Agha I","Labalette M"],"doi":"10.1111\/ejh.12283","first_seen_on":"2015-01-07T11:54:36+00:00","issns":["0902-4441"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Haematology","last_mentioned_on":1420631649,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24520815?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24520815","pubdate":"2014-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Na\u00efve subset develops the most important alloreactive response among human CD4<sup>+<\/sup> T lymphocytes in HLA-identical related setting.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nave-subset-develops-most-important-alloreactive-response-among-human-cd4-t-lymphocytes-human-leukoc"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4707237,"mean":5.4401106722151,"rank":3815138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4707237,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156673,"mean":8.4200605596407,"rank":123329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156673,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":437,"mean":1.4472018348624,"rank":323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":437,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.82142857142857,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
