This article reviews monitoring using a PAC. Issues addressed include basic physiology that determines cardiac output and blood pressure; methodology in the measurement of data obtained from a PAC; use of the PAC in making a diagnosis and for patient management, with emphasis on a responsive approach to management; and uses of the PAC that are not indications by themselves for placing the catheter, but can provide useful information when a PAC is in place.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005851","doi":"10.1016\/j.ccc.2014.08.004","first_seen_on":"2015-01-07T23:13:27+00:00","issns":["07490704"],"journal":"Critical care clinics","last_mentioned_on":1424994587,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0749070414000797","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ccc.2014.08.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25435479"],"pmid":"25435479","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/invasive-hemodynamic-monitoring-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6371516,"mean":5.9112331133188,"rank":965138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":5402002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6371516,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":193466,"mean":8.3336299278941,"rank":38394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":154929,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":193466,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195,"mean":3.0565463917526,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.485,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
