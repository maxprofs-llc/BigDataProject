However, the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in gastric cancer has not been fully understood. In this study, we reported that miR-101 is significantly down-regulated in H. pylori positive tissues and cells and in tumor tissues with important functional consequences. Ectopic expression of miR-101 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. We found that miR-101 strongly reduced the expression of SOCS2 oncogene in GC cells. Similar to the restoring miR-26 expression, SOCS2 down-regulation inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression, whereas SOCS2 over-expression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-101. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-101 suppressed the expression of c-myc, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE2, while promoted tumor suppressor p14, p16, p21 and p27 expression. In clinical specimens, SOCS2 was over-expressed in tumors and H. pylori positive tissues and its mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-101 expression. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-101 functions as a growth-suppressive miRNA in H. pylori related GC, and that its suppressive effects are mediated mainly by repressing SOCS2 expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dc7","authors":["Xiaoying Zhou","Yang Xia","Lin Li","Guoxin Zhang"],"doi":"10.4161\/15384047.2014.987523","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T07:07:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1555-8576"],"journal":"Cancer Biology and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1420657810,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25561270?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25561270","pubdate":"2015-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"MiR-101 Inhibits Cell Growth and Tumorigenesis of Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer by Repression of SOCS2.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mir101-inhibits-cell-growth-tumorigenesis-helicobacter-pylori-related-gastric-cancer-repression-socs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4707237,"mean":5.4401106722151,"rank":3815186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":145326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4707237,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156509,"mean":8.4261188948809,"rank":123208,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1931,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156509,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":633,"mean":1.7550063291139,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":633,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.325,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
