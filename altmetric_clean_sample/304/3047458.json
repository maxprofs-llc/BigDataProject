Defining a \"weak chimera\" as a type of invariant set showing partial frequency synchronization, we show that this means they cannot appear in phase oscillator networks that are either globally coupled or too small. We exhibit various networks of four, six, and ten indistinguishable oscillators, where weak chimeras exist with various dynamics and stabilities. We examine the role of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi coupling in giving degenerate (neutrally stable) families of weak chimera states in these example networks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024db","authors":["Peter Ashwin","Oleksandr Burylko","Ashwin P","Burylko O"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.4905197","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T16:56:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handle":"10871\/16632","handles":["10871\/16632"],"issns":["1089-7682","1054-1500"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chaos","last_mentioned_on":1502457315,"links":["http:\/\/scitation.aip.org\/content\/aip\/journal\/chaos\/25\/1\/10.1063\/1.4905197?TRACK=RSS","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1063\/1.4905197","http:\/\/aip.scitation.org\/doi\/10.1063\/1.4905197?Track=CHAOStweet","http:\/\/aip.scitation.org\/doi\/10.1063\/1.4905197?Track=CHAOSfb"],"pmid":"25637917","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"AIP Publishing","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Numerical And Computational Mathematics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Mathematics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"013106","subjects":["science"],"title":"Weak chimeras in minimal networks of coupled phase oscillators","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/aip.scitation.org\/doi\/10.1063\/1.4905197","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/weak-chimeras-minimal-networks-coupled-phase-oscillators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":3962480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4207292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":240695,"mean":7.9796583047356,"rank":100171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":132951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":240695,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":945,"mean":4.755031779661,"rank":222,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":715,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":945,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":1.17704,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
