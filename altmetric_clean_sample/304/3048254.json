In this study, by examining mice with a selective deficiency of systemic eosinophils (by lineage ablation) or GI eosinophils (eotaxin-1\/2 double deficient or CC chemokine receptor 3 deficient), we show that eosinophils support immunoglobulin A (IgA) class switching, maintain intestinal mucus secretions, affect intestinal microbial composition, and promote the development of Peyer's patches. Eosinophil-deficient mice showed reduced expression of mediators of secretory IgA production, including intestinal interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), inducible nitric oxide synthase, lymphotoxin (LT) \u03b1, and LT-\u03b2, and reduced levels of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t-positive (ROR-\u03b3t(+)) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), while maintaining normal levels of APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand), BAFF (B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family), and TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor \u03b2). GI eosinophils expressed a relatively high level of IL-1\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2-deficient mice manifested the altered gene expression profiles observed in eosinophil-deficient mice and decreased levels of IgA(+) cells and ROR-\u03b3t(+) ILCs. On the basis of these collective data, we propose that eosinophils are required for homeostatic intestinal immune responses including IgA production and that their affect is mediated via IL-1\u03b2 in the small intestine.Mucosal Immunology advance online publication, 7 January 2015; doi:10.1038\/mi.2014.123.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52f3cf058f61000423d","authors":["Y Jung","T Wen","M K Mingler","J M Caldwell","Y H Wang","D D Chaplin","E H Lee","M H Jang","S Y Woo","J Y Seoh","M Miyasaka","M E Rothenberg","Jung Y","Wen T","Mingler MK","Caldwell JM","Wang YH","Chaplin DD","Lee EH","Jang MH","Woo SY","Seoh JY","Miyasaka M","Rothenberg ME"],"doi":"10.1038\/mi.2014.123","first_seen_on":"2015-01-08T20:37:58+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1935-3456","1933-0219"],"issue":"4","journal":"Mucosal Immunology (1933-0219)","last_mentioned_on":1458914294,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25563499?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/feeds.nature.com\/~r\/mi\/rss\/aop\/~3\/9HhPD-YTvpM\/mi.2014.123","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/mi.2014.123","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25563499"],"pmid":"25563499","pubdate":"2015-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"IL-1\u03b2 in eosinophil-mediated small intestinal homeostasis and IgA production.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/il1%CE%B2-eosinophilmediated-small-intestinal-homeostasis-iga-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8059538,"mean":6.8397725663364,"rank":730391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7319640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8059538,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237853,"mean":7.9247335990449,"rank":26624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":210937,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237853,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":612,"mean":6.284651391162,"rank":82,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":516,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":612,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":9.8067647058824,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
