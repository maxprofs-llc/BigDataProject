The molecular basis of this trait is poorly understood but thought to be associated with critical changes in membrane function. We profiled membrane lipids of seeds in eight species with varying levels of desiccation tolerance and found a close association between reducing seed viability and increasing phosphatidic acid (PA). We applied hydration-dehydration cycles to Arabidopsis seeds, that are normally desiccation tolerant, to mimic the onset of desiccation sensitivity with progression towards germination and examined the role of phospholipase D (PLD) in desiccation stress-induced production of PA. We found that PLD\u03b11 became more abundant and migrated from the cytosol to the membrane during desiccation, whereas PLD\u03b4 did not change, and that all desiccation-induced PA was derived from PLD\u03b11 hydrolysis. When PLD\u03b11 was suppressed, the germination level after each hydration-dehydration cycle improved significantly. We further demonstrated that PLD\u03b11-mediated PA formation modulates desiccation sensitivity as applying its inhibitor improved seed desiccation tolerance and its suppression in protoplasts enhanced survival under dehydration. The insights provided by comparative lipidomics enable us to propose a new membrane-based model for seed desiccation stress and survival.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003340","authors":["Chen, Hongying","Yu, Xiaomei","Zhang, Xudong","Yang, Lan","Huang, Xing","Zhang, Jie","Pritchard, Hugh W.","Li, Weiqi"],"doi":"10.1111\/pce.12925","first_seen_on":"2017-04-13T10:20:43+00:00","issns":["01407791","1365-3040"],"journal":"Plant, Cell & Environment","last_mentioned_on":1492078829,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12925\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch&utm_content=buffer57a68&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pce.12925\/pdf","pmid":"28152567","pubdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","botany"],"title":"Phospholipase D\u03b11-mediated phosphatidic acid change is a key determinant of desiccation-induced viability loss in seeds","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phospholipase-d1mediated-phosphatidic-acid-change-key-determinant-desiccationinduced-viability-loss"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":6987573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237754,"mean":12.88904796154,"rank":194211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237754,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1179,"mean":2.8243837011885,"rank":1076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1179,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":3.3592857142857,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
