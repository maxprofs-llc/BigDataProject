Despite this, research on health effects of saline contaminated water is scarce in this region. This study examines the risk of hospital admission for hypertension in salinity-affected areas of the MDR.\nCases and controls were obtained from national\/provincial hospital admission records for 2013. The cases were adult patients whom hypertension (ICD10-code: I10-I15) was primary diagnosis for admission. Of the 13 provinces in the MDR, we identified seven as 'salinity exposed' and the remaining as 'non-exposed' areas. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to examine the association between salinity exposure and hypertension outcome.\nOf the total 573 650 hospital admissions, 22 382 (~3.9%) were hypertensive cases. The multi-level logistic model combining both individual and ecological factors showed a 9% increase in risk (95% CI: 3-14%) of hypertension admission among individuals in exposed areas compared to those in non-exposed areas.\nIn order to develop and promote appropriate adaptation strategies, further research is recommended to identify the salt exposure pathways and consumption behaviours in the salinity exposed areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a98","authors":["Talukder, Mohammad Radwanur Rahman","Rutherford, Shannon","Chu, Cordia","Hieu Nguyen, Trung","Phung, Dung"],"doi":"10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx041","first_seen_on":"2017-04-13T11:56:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1741-3842","1741-3850"],"journal":"Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1492081020,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx041\/3610948\/Association-between-salinity-and-hospital?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jpubhealth\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/pubmed\/fdx041\/13165627\/fdx041.pdf","pmid":"28419386","pubdate":"2017-04-19T22:01:54+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"OUP accepted manuscript","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-between-salinity-hospital-admission-hypertension-ecological-casecontrol-study-mekong-del"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":1523071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6526727,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237754,"mean":12.889011663365,"rank":61563,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":175059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237754,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1238,"mean":9.0732223120453,"rank":363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1238,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":11.287931034483,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Earth and Planetary Sciences":1,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Association between salinity and hospital admission for hypertension: an ecological case\u2013control study in the Mekong Delta Region in Vietnam","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/association-between-salinity-and-hospital-admission-for-hypertension-an-ecological-case-control-study-in-the-mekong-delta-region-in-vietnam\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[18793487],"posted_on":"2017-04-13T10:57:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nRead the article:&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAssociation between salinity and hospital admission for hypertension: an ecological case&ndash;control study in the Mekong Delta Region in Vietnam\nThe post Association between salinity and hospital admission for hyper","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
