Eight consecutive patients with PsA were enrolled in this study. Gray scale CEUS evaluation was performed on the same joint immediately after joint aspiration, by automatic assessment perfusion data, using a new quantification approach of pixel-based analysis and the gamma-variate model. The set of perfusional parameters considered by the time intensity curve includes the maximum value (peak) of the signal intensity curve, the blood volume index or area under the curve, (BVI, AUC) and the contrast mean transit time (MTT). The direct ex vivo analysis of the frequencies of SF IL17A-F(+)CD161(+)IL23(+) CD4(+) T cells subsets were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). In cross-sectional analyses, when tested for multiple comparison setting, a false discovery rate at 10%, a common pattern of correlations between CEUS Peak, AUC (BVI) and MTT parameters with the IL17A-F(+)IL23(+) - IL17A-F(+)CD161(+) - and IL17A-F(+)CD161(+)IL23(+) CD4(+) T cells subsets, as well as lack of correlation between both peak and AUC values and both CD4(+)T and CD4(+)IL23(+) T cells, was observed. The pixel-based CEUS assessment is a truly measure synovial inflammation, as a useful tool to develop quantitative imaging biomarker for monitoring target therapeutics in PsA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002579","authors":["Ugo Fiocco","Roberto Stramare","Veronica Martini","Alessandro Coran","Francesco Caso","Luisa Costa","Mara Felicetti","Gaia Rizzo","Matteo Tonietto","Anna Scanu","Francesca Oliviero","Bernd Raffeiner","Maristella Vezz\u00f9","Francesca Lunardi","Raffaele Scarpa","David Sacerdoti","Leopoldo Rubaltelli","Leonardo Punzi","Andrea Doria","Enrico Grisan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10067-016-3500-x","first_seen_on":"2017-04-13T10:03:27+00:00","issns":["0770-3198","1434-9949"],"journal":"Clinical Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1492084895,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27995384?dopt=Abstract","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27995384?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27995384","pubdate":"2017-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Quantitative imaging by pixel-based contrast-enhanced ultrasound reveals a linear relationship between synovial vascular perfusion and the recruitment of pathogenic IL-17A-F+IL-23+ CD161+ CD4+ T helper cells in psoriatic arthritis joints","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-imaging-pixelbased-contrastenhanced-ultrasound-reveals-linear-relationship-between-syno"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069307,"mean":6.8479199559378,"rank":4035621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3828976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069307,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237756,"mean":12.888900212403,"rank":121636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":105880,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237756,"percentile":44},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1014,"mean":4.1514708785785,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1014,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.6779411764706,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
