Among the boom-forming species, potential toxin producers have been identified. The aim of this paper was to study the presence of neurotoxic compounds - saxitoxins and anatoxin-a - in water bodies from different regions of Russia. We also made attempts to identify the neurotoxin-producing genera. The good convergence of the results obtained by light microscopy, PCR and LC-MS\/MS analyses indicated the presence of active neurotoxin producing species in all investigated water bodies. Saxitoxin was detected in phytoplankton from 4 water bodies in Central European Russia and West Siberia, including lake and reservoirs used as a source for potable water. The water bodies differed with the respect of saxitoxin producers which belonged to Aphanizomenon and\/or Dolichospermum genera. For the first time, we obtained quantitative data on the intracellular saxitoxin concentration in Russian freshwaters using LC-MS\/MS. Anatoxin-a was detected only in lakes of Northwestern Russia. In the eutrophic shallow Lower Suzdal Lake, Aphanizomenon was the stated anatoxin-a-producing genus. In the large shallow artificial hypertrophic Sestroretskij Razliv Lake, it was very likely that both dominant species - Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Dolichospermum planctonicum - were anatoxin-a producers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000367e","authors":["Ekaterina Chernova","Sergey Sidelev","Iana Russkikh","Ekaterina Voyakina","Olga Babanazarova","Roman Romanov","Anton Kotovshchikov","Hanna Mazur-Marzec"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.toxicon.2017.02.016","first_seen_on":"2017-04-13T11:42:52+00:00","issns":["00410101"],"journal":"Toxicon","last_mentioned_on":1492197805,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0041010117300624","http:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.toxicon.2017.02.016"],"pmid":"28235579","pubdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"title":"Dolichospermum and Aphanizomenon as neurotoxins producers in some Russian freshwaters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dolichospermum-aphanizomenon-neurotoxins-producers-some-russian-freshwaters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.3,"score_history":{"1y":4.3,"6m":4.3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8072166,"mean":6.8521645392475,"rank":1695172,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6372494,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8072166,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237920,"mean":12.892972179607,"rank":68048,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":169560,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237920,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1304,"mean":3.8082640061397,"rank":238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1304,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.3970588235294,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
