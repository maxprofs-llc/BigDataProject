Resting maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) is lower in women with SUI, but it is unknown whether PFMT can alter resting MUCP. This systematic review evaluated whether voluntary pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction increases MUCP above its resting value (augmented MUCP) and the effect of PFMT on resting and augmented MUCP.\nExperimental and effect studies were identified using PubMed and PEDro. The PEDro scale was used to assess internal validity of interventional studies.\nWe identified 21 studies investigating the influence of voluntary PFM contraction in women. Comparison was hindered by varying demographics, antecedent history, reporting of confirmed correct PFM contraction, and urethral pressure profilometry (UPP) techniques. Mean incremental increase in MUCP during PFM contraction in healthy women was 8-47.3\u00a0cm H2O; in women with urinary incontinence (UI), it was 6-24\u00a0cm H2O. Nine trials reporting MUCP as an outcome of PFMT were found. Wide variation in PFMT regimes affected the findings. Two studies found significant improvement in MUCP of 5-18\u00a0cm\u00a0H20. Seven studies assessed augmentation of MUCP with PFM contraction; mean increase was -0.1 to 25\u00a0cm\u00a0H20.\nThere is no definitive evidence that PFMT increases resting MUCP as its mechanism of action in managing SUI. The degree to which a voluntary PFM contraction augments MUCP varies widely. There was evidence to suggest PFMT increases augmented MUCP. Drawing firm conclusions was hampered by study methodologies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002bda","authors":["Maria Zubieta","Rebecca L. Carr","Marcus J.
