In this study, we have integrated a set of systems-biology tools and databases and have analysed more than 8000 molecular pathways on published global gene expression datasets of human cells in microgravity. Hundreds of new pathways have been identified with statistical confidence for each dataset and despite the difference in cell types and experiments, around 100 of the new pathways are appeared common across the datasets. They are related to reduced inflammation, autoimmunity, diabetes and asthma. We have identified downregulation of Nf\u03baB pathway via Notch1 signalling as new pathway for reduced immunity in microgravity. Induction of few cancer types including liver cancer and leukaemia and increased drug response to cancer in microgravity are also found. Increase in olfactory signal transduction is also identified. Genes, based on their expression pattern, are clustered and mathematically stable clusters are identified. The network mapping of genes within a cluster indicates the plausible functional connections in microgravity. This pipeline gives a new systems level picture of human cells under microgravity, generates testable hypothesis and may help estimating risk and developing medicine for space missions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Mukhopadhyay, Sayak","Saha, Rohini","Palanisamy, Anbarasi","Ghosh, Madhurima","Biswas, Anupriya","Roy, Saheli","Pal, Arijit","Sarkar, Kathakali","Bagh, Sangram"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep25975","first_seen_on":"2016-05-18T20:00:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1463601583,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27185415?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27185415","pubdate":"2016-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemical networks","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Astrobiology","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"25975","subjects":["science"],"title":"A systems biology pipeline identifies new immune and disease related molecular signatures and networks in human cells during microgravity exposure","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systems-biology-pipeline-identifies-new-immune-disease-related-molecular-signatures-networks-human-c"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":6673588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269126,"mean":11.519230134695,"rank":224644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269126,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30414,"mean":14.97565416105,"rank":25940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30414,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3018,"mean":14.816279085184,"rank":2491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3018,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
