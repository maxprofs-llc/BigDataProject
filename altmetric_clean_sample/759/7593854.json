Clinically relevant absorption rates (>1000 mL) were observed in the sevoflurane group (P = .04) while none of the women receiving intravenous anesthesia reached this absorption level. No cases of severe post-operative hyponatremia (Na(1+)<125 mmol\/L) or adverse events derived from glycine 1.5% absorption were reported. No major complications (such as perforations, severe hemorrhage or infection) were presented during the interventions.\nThe results of the present study show that the use of inhaled sevoflurane is associated with significantly increased glycine 1.5% absorption compared to intravenous propofol for the maintenance of anesthesia. However, further randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the possible mechanisms and risk factors involved in the higher absorption induced by sevoflurane.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cfc","authors":["Munmany, Meritxell","Gracia, Meritxell","Nonell, Roser","Cardona, Montserrat","Pons, Montserrat","Martin, Miriam","Alcolea, Antonia","Balasch, Juan","Carmona, Francisco"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jclinane.2016.02.012","endpage":"207","first_seen_on":"2016-05-18T19:35:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-4529","09528180"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Anesthesia","last_mentioned_on":1463600065,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27185712?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"27185712","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"202","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"The use of inhaled sevoflurane during operative hysteroscopy is associated with increased glycine absorption compared to intravenous propofol for maintenance of anesthesia","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhaled-sevoflurane-during-operative-hysteroscopy-associated-increased-glycine-absorption-compared-i"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":6673588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269126,"mean":11.519237566186,"rank":224646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269126,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":914,"mean":1.4119145673604,"rank":489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":914,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.1358974358974,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/statuses\/733017919710318592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[7593854],"posted_on":"2016-05-18T19:34:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
