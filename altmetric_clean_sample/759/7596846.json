However, a limited number of studies focused on the Coptis alkaloids other than berberine.\nIn the present study, we investigated the anti-diabetic potential of Coptis alkaloids, including berberine (1), epiberberine (2), magnoflorine (3), and coptisine (4), by evaluating the ability of these compounds to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and ONOO(\u2012)-mediated protein tyrosine nitration. We scrutinized the potentials of Coptis alkaloids as PTP1B inhibitors via enzyme kinetics and molecular docking simulation.\nThe Coptis alkaloids 1\u20124 exhibited remarkable inhibitory activities against PTP1B with the IC50 values of 16.43, 24.19, 28.14, and 51.04\u03bcM, respectively, when compared to the positive control ursolic acid. These alkaloids also suppressed ONOO(-)-mediated tyrosine nitration effectively in a dose dependent manner. In addition, our kinetic study using Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots revealed that 1 and 2 showed a mixed-type inhibition against PTP1B, while 3 and 4 noncompetitively inhibited PTP1B. Moreover, molecular docking simulation of these compounds demonstrated negative binding energies (Autodock 4.0=-6.7 to -7.8kcal\/mol; Fred 2.0=-59.4 to -68.2kcal\/mol) and a high proximity to PTP1B residues, including Phe182 and Asp181 in the WPD loop, Cys215 in the active sites and Tyr46, Arg47, Asp48, Val49, Ser216, Ala217, Gly218, Ile219, Gly220, Arg221 and Gln262 in the pocket site, indicating a higher affinity and tighter binding capacity of these alkaloids for the active site of the enzyme.\nOur results clearly indicate the promising anti-diabetic potential of Coptis alkaloids as inhibitors on PTP1B as well as suppressors of ONOO(-)-mediated protein tyrosine nitration, and thus hold promise as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes and related disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f23cf058f610002d8d","authors":["Choi, Jae Sue","Ali, Md Yousof","Jung, Hyun Ah","Oh, Sang Ho","Choi, Ran Joo","Kim, Eon Ji"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jep.2015.05.020","endpage":"36","first_seen_on":"2016-05-18T21:01:26+00:00","issns":["1872-7573","03788741"],"journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1463605267,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26027757?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26027757","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"28","subjects":["socialsciences","pharmacology"],"title":"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activity of alkaloids from Rhizoma Coptidis and their molecular docking studies","type":"article","volume":"171","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-1b-inhibitory-activity-alkaloids-rhizoma-coptidis-molecular-docking-stu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":6673588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269127,"mean":11.519162622711,"rank":224638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269127,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2512,"mean":3.7801298287535,"rank":1832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2512,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102,"mean":6.1232673267327,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
