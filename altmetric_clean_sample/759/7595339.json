In particular, the identification of strains of the same O serogroup is essential in outbreak investigations and surveillance. In a previous study we analyzed the O-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster in all known E. coli O serogroups (Iguchi A. et al. DNA Research 2015, 22:101-107). Based on those results we have now arranged 162 PCR primer pairs for the identification or classification of O serogroups. Of these, 147 pairs are used for identifying 147 individual O serogroups with unique O-antigen biosynthesis genes and the other 15 pairs are used for identifying 15 groups of strains (Gp1-Gp15). Each of these groups consists of strains with identical or very similar O-antigen biosynthesis genes and the groups represent a total of 35 individual O serogroups. We then used the 162 primer pairs to create 20 multiplex PCR reaction sets. Each set contains six to nine primer pairs that amplify products of markedly different sizes. This genetic methodology (E. coli O-genotyping PCR) allows for comprehensive, rapid, and low-cost typing. Validation of the PCR system using O-serogroup reference and wild strains showed that the correct O serogroups were specifically and accurately identified for 100% (182\/182) and 90.8% (522\/575) of reference and wild strains, respectively. The PCR-based system reported here might be a promising tool for the subtyping of E. coli strains for epidemiological studies as well as for the surveillance of pathogenic E. coli during outbreaks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007be9","authors":["Iguchi, Atsushi","Iyoda, Sunao","Seto, Kazuko","Morita-Ishihara, Tomoko","Scheutz, Flemming","Ohnishi, Makoto",", "],"doi":"10.1128\/jcm.00321-15","endpage":"2432","first_seen_on":"2016-05-18T20:11:20+00:00","issns":["1098-660X","0095-1137"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Clinical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1463602264,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25926488?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25926488","pubdate":"2015-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2427","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Escherichia coli O-Genotyping PCR: a Comprehensive and Practical Platform for Molecular O Serogrouping","type":"article","volume":"53","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/escherichia-coli-ogenotyping-pcr-comprehensive-practical-platform-molecular-o-serogrouping"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":6673586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269127,"mean":11.519189190193,"rank":224643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269127,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4138,"mean":4.353484167271,"rank":3667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4138,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":3.4593333333333,"rank":79,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
