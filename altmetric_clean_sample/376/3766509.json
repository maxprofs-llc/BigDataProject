Concerns that this distinction could not be made reliably delayed its inclusion in official nomenclature until DSM-IV appeared 25 years later. The availability of other operational definitions and, in particular, the Research Diagnostic Criteria, nevertheless fostered an accumulation of findings in support of bipolar II disorder as a valid category.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bee","authors":["Coryell WH"],"doi":"10.4088\/jcp.14com09639","first_seen_on":"2015-03-08T21:32:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1425850412,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25742213?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25742213","pubdate":"2015-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Bipolar II disorder: reasons to recognize.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bipolar-ii-disorder-reasons-recognize"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8315518,"mean":7.0064996682623,"rank":4122597,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4129258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8315518,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":203659,"mean":9.3881584715552,"rank":97318,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":104385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":203659,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2473,"mean":10.71584789644,"rank":1844,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2473,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":14.843243243243,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/status\/574684011567546368","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3766509],"posted_on":"2015-03-08T21:32:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
