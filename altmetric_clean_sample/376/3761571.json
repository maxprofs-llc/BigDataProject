Current concepts suggest that both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, particularly in young people, can result as a consequence of cocaine exposure. We provide an analysis of mechanisms of injury and a discussion of the pharmacological management of stroke following cocaine use. Preclinical research suggests that the cause of cocaine-mediated stroke is multifactorial and involves vasospasm, changes in cerebral vasculature, and platelet aggregation. We suggest that drugs able to induce vasospastic, thrombogenic, or neurotoxic effects of cocaine could be suitable as therapeutic agents. In contrast caution should be exerted when using anti-platelet and thrombolytic agents in cocaine users with stroke.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269e","authors":["Antonio Siniscalchi","Antonello Bonci","Nicola Biagio Mercuri","Antonia De Siena","Giovambattista De Sarro","Giovanni Malferrari","Marco Diana","Luca Gallelli"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-06T13:46:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-5739"],"journal":"Current Neurovascular Research","last_mentioned_on":1425649490,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25742568?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25742568","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Cocaine Dependence and Stroke: Pathogenesis and Management.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840099,"mean":5.7736249319777,"rank":2569066,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1615199,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840099,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144537,"mean":10.15735242431,"rank":81447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144537,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":2.22976,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.1714285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JoelMartinRa2\/status\/573841672829698048","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3761571],"posted_on":"2015-03-06T13:44:50+00:00","author":{"name":"pharmaceutics","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/572504554789273600\/N4DPTFT__normal.png","id_on_source":"JoelMartinRa2","tweeter_id":"3066007679","followers":1},"tweet_id":"573841672829698048"}]}}
