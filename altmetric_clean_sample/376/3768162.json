The programme aims to develop human resource capacity through 12-month mentoring arrangements between individual VIP experts (mentors) and less-experienced injury practitioners (mentees). In this paper, we review the first five years of the programme (2007-2011) using a systems analysis and SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) frameworks, discuss programme findings and make recommendations. A well-defined programme with clear instructions, successful matching of mentorship pairs with similar interests and language, a formal accord agreement, institutional support and effective communication were identified as programme strengths. Overambitious projects, lack of funds and difficulties with communications were identified as programme weaknesses. Mentorship projects that require institutional permissions or resources could be potential threats to the success of mentorship. The study resulted in the four following recommendations to strengthen the programme: (1) institute additional steps in selection and matching mentor-mentee pair; (2) train mentors on e-mentoring; (3) conduct special orientation for mentees to the programme; and (4) maintain effective and open communication throughout the programme.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f0","authors":["Wadhwaniya S","Meddings D","Gururaj G","Ozanne-Smith J","Ameratunga S","Hyder AA","Shirin Wadhwaniya","David Meddings","Gopalkrishna Gururaj","Joan Ozanne-Smith","Shanthi Ameratunga","Adnan A.
