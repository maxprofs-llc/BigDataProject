Here we report that ginsenoside Rg3 and Rh2, major components of red ginseng, induce apoptotic cell death in a stereoisomer-specific fashion. The 20(S)-forms of Rg3 and Rh2, but not their respective 20(R)-forms, promoted cell death in a dose-dependent manner accompanied by downregulation of Bcl2 and upregulation of Fas, resulting in apoptosis of HepG2 cells with poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. The LD50 value [45\u2009\u00b5M for Rg3(S), less than 10\u2009\u00b5M for Rh2(S)] and gross morphological electron microscopic observation revealed more severe cellular damage in cells treated with Rh2(S) than in those treated with Rg3(S). Both Rg3(S) and Rh2(S) also induced autophagy when undergoing induced apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy with lysosomotrophic agents significantly potentiated the cellular damage, implying a favorable switch of the cell fate to tumor cell death. Blocking intracellular calcium with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) restored the cell death induced by both Rg3(S) and Rh2(S). Our results suggest that the 20(S)-forms of Rg3 and Rh2 in red ginseng possess more potent antitumor activity with autophagy than their 20(R)-forms via calcium-dependent apoptosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c62","authors":["Jong Hye Cheong","Hyeryung Kim","Min Jee Hong","Min Hye Yang","Jung Wha Kim","Hunseung Yoo","Heejung Yang","Jeong Hill Park","Sang Hyun Sung","Hong Pyo Kim","Jinwoong Kim"],"doi":"10.1248\/bpb.b14-00603","first_seen_on":"2015-03-07T11:31:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1347-5215"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1425727806,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25744465?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25744465","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology","biochemistry"],"title":"Stereoisomer-Specific Anticancer Activities of Ginsenoside Rg3 and Rh2 in HepG2 Cells: Disparity in Cytotoxicity and Autophagy-Inducing Effects Due to 20(S)-Epimers.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stereoisomerspecific-anticancer-activities-ginsenoside-rg3-rh2-hepg2-cells-disparity-cytotoxicity-au-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842435,"mean":5.7731763402492,"rank":4052259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143901,"mean":10.092471188325,"rank":119476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143901,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":802,"mean":2.2612234706617,"rank":642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":802,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.0208333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AutophagyPapers\/status\/574170153966923776","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3764117],"posted_on":"2015-03-07T11:30:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Autophagy Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/559405603697590273\/EoGNUIXe_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for #Autophagy papers.
