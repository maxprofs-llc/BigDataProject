Methods: A prototype swept-source OCT system operating at 100 kHz axial scan rate was developed and interfaced with a pulse oximeter. Using the plethysmogram measured from the earlobe, Doppler OCT imaging of a 1.5 mm\u00d72 mm area at the optic disc at 1.8 volumes\/sec was synchronized to cardiac cycle to improve sampling of pulsatile blood flow. Post-processing algorithms were developed to achieve fully automatic calculation of TRBF. We evaluated the repeatability of en face Doppler OCT measurement of TRBF in 10 healthy young subjects using three methods: measurement at 100 kHz with asynchronous acquisition, at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition, and a control measurement using a 400 kHz instrument with asynchronous acquisition. Results: The median intra-subject coefficients of variation (COV) of the three methods were 8.0%, 4.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. All three methods correlated well, without a significant bias. Mean TRBF measured at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition was 40.5\u00b18.2 \u00b5L\/min and the range was from 26.6 to 55.8 \u00b5L\/min. Conclusions: Cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT can achieve smaller measurement variability than previously reported methods. Although further validation in older subjects and diseased subjects is required, precise measurement of TRBF using cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT at commercially available imaging speeds should be feasible.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a79","authors":["ByungKun Lee","WooJhon Choi","Jonathan Liu","Chen Lu","Joel S Schuman","Gadi Wollstein","Jay S Duker","Nadia Waheed","James G Fujimoto","Lee B","Choi W","Liu J","Lu C","Schuman JS","Wollstein G","Duker JS","Waheed N","Fujimoto JG"],"doi":"10.1167\/iovs.14-16119","first_seen_on":"2015-03-07T13:12:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1552-5783","0146-0404"],"issue":"4","journal":"Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science","last_mentioned_on":1425733912,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25744974?dopt=Abstract#pubmed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25744974?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25744974","pubdate":"2015-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2522","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Cardiac-Gated En Face Doppler Measurement of Retinal Blood Flow Using Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography at 100,000 Axial Scans per Second.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cardiacgated-en-face-doppler-measurement-retinal-blood-flow-using-sweptsource-optical-coherence-tomo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842063,"mean":5.7759012168804,"rank":4052184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842063,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143907,"mean":10.091671896933,"rank":119495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143907,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2041,"mean":2.2452843137255,"rank":1589,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2041,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":1.8438936170213,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
