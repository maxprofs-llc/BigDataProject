Such is the case at the molecular level for the nuclear receptors (NRs), which seem to have originated concomitantly with the earliest metazoan lineage of animals. A wide array of NRs persists today throughout all animal phyla with many different functions, yet they share a highly conserved protein structure, a testament to their having evolved through numerous gene duplications. Of particular interest for this readership are the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), which have significant supportive roles in energy creation and regulation, mitochondrial function and biogenesis, development, tissue repair, hypoxia, and cancer. Thus, placed at the nexus of energetics and homeostasis, ERR (in association with the coregulatory molecules peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 and -\u03b2) can facilitate repair from injury and adaptations to stressful environments. Whereas it is curious that ERRs and some other NRs exist as \"orphans\" by virtue of having no known cognate ligand, increasing interest in the estrogen receptor has led to the development of synthetic ligands and screening for naturally occurring molecules, either capable of modulating ERR activity. Thus, what is needed now is a nomenclature update for the ERR to focus the mind on energetics and metabolism, the most compromised and crucial systems after trauma and shock.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008925","authors":["Hubbard, William J","Bland, Kirby I","Chaudry, Irshad H"],"doi":"10.1097\/shk.0000000000000364","first_seen_on":"2015-03-09T20:12:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1073-2322","1540-0514"],"issue":"1","journal":"Shock","last_mentioned_on":1434706494,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_ERRor_of_Our_Ways___Estrogen_Related_Receptors.98555.aspx","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26070000?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Fulltext\/2015\/07000\/The_ERRor_of_Our_Ways___Estrogen_Related_Receptors.2.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/Fulltext\/2015\/07000\/The_ERRor_of_Our_Ways___Estrogen_Related_Receptors.2.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/shockjournal\/9000\/00000\/The_ERRor_of_Our_Ways___Estrogen_Related_Receptors.98555.pdf","pmid":"26070000","pubdate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"The ERRor of Our Ways: Estrogen-Related Receptors are About Energy, Not Hormones, and are Potential New Targets for Trauma and Shock","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/error-ways-estrogenrelated-receptors-about-energy-not-hormones-potential-new-targets-trauma-shock"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5252026,"mean":6.186344343374,"rank":2785140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1783852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5252026,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":153676,"mean":10.28815575728,"rank":86692,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":50976,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":153676,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1493,"mean":1.1511648793566,"rank":286,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":1095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1493,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.8185185185185,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":56}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
