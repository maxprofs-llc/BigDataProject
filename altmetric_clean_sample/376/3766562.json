Despite the prevalence of this practice, scholars know little about how it affects inequalities in the time spent on housework. Drawing on data on 3540 dual-earner households in Spain, this article examines the relationship between hiring domestic work and both the within-household gender gap in housework and the class gap in housework among women. I find that women who hire do about 30min less housework per day than non-hiring women, but in relation to their partners these women continue to do the same share of housework. Using counterfactual analysis, I find that the absence of paid domestic work is associated with a 20% decline in the class gap in housework among Spanish women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001fa8","authors":["Gonalons-Pons, Pilar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ssresearch.2015.01.008","first_seen_on":"2015-03-08T22:22:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0049089X","1096-0317"],"journal":"Social Science Research","last_mentioned_on":1425863100,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0049089X15000459"],"pmid":"26004458","pubdate":"2015-05-26T22:01:30+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["socialsciences","historyofmedicine"],"title":"Gender and class housework inequalities in the era of outsourcing hiring domestic work in Spain ","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-class-housework-inequalities-era-outsourcing-hiring-domestic-work-spain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4849872,"mean":5.7830591341486,"rank":1935683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":2878408,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4849872,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":145707,"mean":10.122390567307,"rank":56302,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":87580,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":145707,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":432,"mean":10.454060324826,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":432,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":28.87,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
