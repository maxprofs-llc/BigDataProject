Recent GWAS result identified that anthrax roxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) was one of the ankylosing spondylitis (AS) risk loci. Previous study also showed that ANTXR2 could potentially affect new bone formation. This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanisms of ANTXR2 involved in AS pathogenesis. Methods. The expression level of ANTXR2 and miR-124 in peripheral blood was detected by qRT-PCR. ANTXR2 was predicted to be a target gene of miR-124 by TargetScan, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. Western blot analysis was used to further investigate the effect of miR-124 on JNK activation and evaluated the activated status of autophagy. Results. We evidenced that ANTXR2 was down-regulated and miR-124 was up-regulated in peripheral blood from AS patients. Intriguingly, miR-124 targeted ANTXR2 and overexpression of miR-124 in Jurkat cells notably inhibited ANTXR2 expression. ANTXR2 inhibition by miR-124 promoted JNK activation and induced autophagy. Conclusions. Our results suggested that miR-124 might induce autophagy to participate in AS by targeting ANTXR2, which might be implicated in pathological process of AS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310a","authors":["Yu Xia","Kun Chen","Ming-Hua Zhang","Lai-Cheng Wang","Chun-Yan Ma","Yan-Liang Lin","Yue-Ran Zhao"],"doi":"10.3109\/14397595.2015.1023887","first_seen_on":"2015-03-06T05:47:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7609"],"journal":"Modern Rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1425620772,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25736362?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25736362","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"MicroRNA-124 involves in ankylosing spondylitis by targeting ANTXR2.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna124-involves-ankylosing-spondylitis-targeting-antxr2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840066,"mean":5.7743542592945,"rank":4050462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840066,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144556,"mean":10.158956618588,"rank":120063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144556,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":1.0892307692308,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.725,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/status\/573721218672562176","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3760259],"posted_on":"2015-03-06T05:46:12+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
