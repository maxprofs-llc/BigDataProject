Remarkable higher adsorption uptakes of benzene and toluene at low pressures on UiO-Phe and -Me2 were found compared to their parent framework UiO-67. It can be ascribed to the presence of functional groups (aromatic rings and methyl groups) that significantly intensified the adsorption, majorly by reducing the effective pore size and increasing the interaction strength with the adsorbates. At high pressures, the pore volumes and accessible surfaces of the frameworks turned out to be the dominant factors governing the adsorption. In the case of toluene\/benzene separation, toluene selectivities of UiOs showed a two-stage separation behavior at the measured pressure range, resulting from the greater interaction affinities of toluene at low pressures and steric hindrance effects at high pressures. Additionally, the counterbalancing factors of enhanced \u03c0 delocalization and suitable pore size of UiO-Phe gave rise to the highest toluene selectivity, suggesting the ligand functionalization strategy could reach both high adsorption capacity and separation selectivity from aromatic mixtures at low concentrations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f61000680f","authors":["Ying Wu"],"doi":"10.1021\/am508570d","first_seen_on":"2015-03-09T18:06:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","last_mentioned_on":1425924376,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/am508570d"],"pmid":"25700143","pubdate":"2015-02-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
