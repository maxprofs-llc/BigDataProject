Among these synthesized compounds (4f, 4g, 4l and 4m) were found to be a broad spectrum molecule active against all bacterial and fungus strains tested, except fungus Aspergillus niger. Amongst the compounds (4g, 4l and 4m) were found to be more potent than respective standard drugs used in the experiment against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus, respectively. All synthesized compounds were also tested for their cytotoxic activity against HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines by the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. This study shows that all compounds were non-cytotoxic in nature, and confirmed their antimicrobial specificity apart from any general cytotoxicity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f2","authors":["Pansare DN","Mulla NA","Pawar CD","Shende VR","Shinde DB"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bmcl.2014.05.051","first_seen_on":"2015-03-07T15:49:13+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters","last_mentioned_on":1425743343,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24951333?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24951333","pubdate":"2014-06-22T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biochemistry"],"title":"One pot three components microwave assisted and conventional synthesis of new 3-(4-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(substituted) thiazolidin-4-one as antimicrobial agents.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/one-pot-three-components-microwave-assisted-conventional-synthesis-new-34chloro2hydroxyphenyl2substi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842063,"mean":5.7759012168804,"rank":4052190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842063,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143909,"mean":10.091540331323,"rank":119497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143909,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1625,"mean":2.3549150246305,"rank":1255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1625,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.6248717948718,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
