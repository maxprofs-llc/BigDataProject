In this context, because of the unique properties of bioresorbable devices, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) may represent the ideal scenario for BVS implantation. Consistently, 57% of physicians declare they currently use BVS in this group of patients. However, continuous and growing evidence on the good performance of these devices has been actually shown only in small studies with short- and mid-term follow-up. For these reasons, we need data from sufficiently large observational studies, with long-term follow-up, to confirm that BVS can deliver the same results as 2nd-generation drug-eluting stents when using an appropriate implantation technique. In this review, we discuss the potential advantages of BVS implantation in STEMI patients, together with the most recent evidence from clinical studies, highlighting safety and procedural concerns.
