Inefficient CoBF and disruption of BLB integrity have long been considered major etiologic factors in a variety of hearing disorders. In this study, we investigate structural changes in the BLB of the striavascularis in age-graded C57BL\/6 mice (1 to 21\u00a0months) with a focus on changes in two blood barrier accessory cells, namely pericytes (PCs) and perivascular-resident macrophage-like melanocytes (PVM\/Ms). Decreased capillary density was detectable at 6\u00a0months, with significant capillary degeneration seen in 9- to 21-month-old mice. Reduced capillary density was highly correlated with lower numbers of PCs and PVM\/Ms. \"Drop-out\" of PCs and \"activation\" of PVM\/Ms were seen at 6\u00a0months, with drastic changes being observed by 21\u00a0months. With newly established in vitro three-dimensional cell-based co-culture models, we demonstrate that PCs and PVM\/Ms are essential for maintaining cochlear vascular architecture and stability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c2","authors":["Lingling Neng","Jinhui Zhang","Ju Yang","Fei Zhang","Ivan A Lopez","Mingmin Dong","Xiaorui Shi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00441-015-2147-2","first_seen_on":"2015-03-06T16:00:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-0878"],"journal":"Cell & Tissue Research","last_mentioned_on":1425657575,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25740201?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25740201","pubdate":"2015-03-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","cellbiology"],"title":"Structural changes in thestrial blood-labyrinth barrier of aged C57BL\/6 mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-changes-thestrial-bloodlabyrinth-barrier-aged-c57bl6-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840099,"mean":5.7736249319777,"rank":2569070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1615197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840099,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144542,"mean":10.15703911001,"rank":81448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144542,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":1.7560026809651,"rank":321,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.53,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
