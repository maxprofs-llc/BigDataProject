Cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived epoxides contribute to enhanced tumourigenesis due to \u03c9-6 PUFA intake. Thus, \u03c9-6 arachidonic acid epoxides (EETs) inhibit apoptosis and stimulate proliferation by up-regulating cyclin D1 expression in cells. The present study evaluated the corresponding \u03c9-3 PUFA epoxides and assessed their role in the regulation of cell proliferation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002450","authors":["Cui PH","Petrovic N","Murray M"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1476-5381.2010.01113.x","first_seen_on":"2015-03-06T13:53:50+00:00","issns":["0007-1188"],"issue":"5","journal":"British Journal of Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1425650078,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21077851"],"pmcid":"PMC3051386","pmid":"21077851","pubdate":"2010-11-17T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The \u03c9-3 epoxide of eicosapentaenoic acid inhibits endothelial cell proliferation by p38 MAP kinase activation and cyclin D1\/CDK4 down-regulation.","type":"article","volume":"162","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3-epoxide-eicosapentaenoic-acid-inhibits-endothelial-cell-proliferation-p38-map-kinase-activation-cy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4840099,"mean":5.7736249319777,"rank":3426977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":789673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4840099,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144543,"mean":10.156982676316,"rank":104652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":24506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144543,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2049,"mean":4.153330078125,"rank":1567,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2049,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":5.3853777777778,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
