Diastolic dysfunction underlies HFpEF; therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms that mediate relaxation can provide new potential targets for treatment. Cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) is a thick filament protein that modulates cross-bridge cycling rates via alterations in its phosphorylation status. Thus, we hypothesize that phosphorylated cMyBP-C accelerates rate of cross-bridge detachment, thereby enhancing relaxation to mediate diastolic function.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006ecf","authors":["Paola C Rosas","Yang Liu","Mohamed I Abdalla","Candice M Thomas","David T Kidwell","Giuseppina F Dusio","Dhriti Mukhopadhyay","Rajesh Kumar","Kenneth M Baker","Brett M Mitchell","Patricia A Powers","Daniel P Fitzsimons","Bindiya G Patel","Chad M Warren","R John Solaro","Richard L Moss","Carl W Tong"],"doi":"10.1161\/circheartfailure.114.001550","first_seen_on":"2015-03-06T11:11:02+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1941-3297"],"journal":"Circulation: Heart Failure","last_mentioned_on":1438683663,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25740839?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/circheartfailure.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2015\/03\/04\/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.114.001550.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25740839"],"pmid":"25740839","pubdate":"2015-03-04T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Phosphorylation of Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein-C is a Critical Mediator of Diastolic Function.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phosphorylation-cardiac-myosinbinding-proteinc-critical-mediator-diastolic-function"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441501,"mean":6.3354329096722,"rank":2512448,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2792157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441501,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156195,"mean":10.253364853964,"rank":73506,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":77600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156195,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":481,"mean":10.117625,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":481,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":10.2375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
