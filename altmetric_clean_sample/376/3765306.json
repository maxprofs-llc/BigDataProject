In fact, UPS plays a key role in various stress conditions such as ischemia, glutamate toxicity, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Huwe1, a homologous to E6-AP carboxy terminus (HECT) domain ubiquitin ligase, is now being regarded as a vital protein involved in neural stem cell differentiation, adult neurogenesis, and the DNA damage response pathway. In response to DNA damage, Huwe1 may have a dual function in arresting DNA replication and in ending checkpoint signaling. The proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells regulated by Huwe1-mediated Notch signaling could also play an important role in neural protection following neural injury. Considering Huwe1 is required for neural precursor survival and the regulation of the DNA damage response pathway, there is growing evidence and considerable hope that Huwe1 might be a therapeutic target for neural injury.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f610007523","authors":["Zhou J","Liu Q","Mao M","Tong Y"],"doi":"10.4238\/2014.june.9.18","first_seen_on":"2015-03-07T23:51:32+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"2","journal":"Genetics and Molecular Research","last_mentioned_on":1425772278,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25036176?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25036176","pubdate":"2014-07-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","genetics"],"title":"Short Communication Huwe1 as a therapeutic target for neural injury.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/huwe1-therapeutic-target-neural-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4842435,"mean":5.7731763402492,"rank":2570032,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1616188,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4842435,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143897,"mean":10.092766678713,"rank":81062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":46629,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143897,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":0.82810978956999,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1071428571429,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/status\/574356680961486849","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3765306],"posted_on":"2015-03-07T23:51:18+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
