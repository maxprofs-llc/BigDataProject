Whether or not prolonged survival is possible after such an event is debatable. Our aim was to describe our experience with seven ovarian cancer patients who experienced malignant cardiac tamponade at tumor diagnosis or at recurrence.\nSix patients were treated with pericardiocentesis and one with pericardial fenestration. Survival after tamponade ranged from 3 to 72 weeks. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We suggest that when pericardial effusion occurs in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, timely diagnosis and proper management might allow palliation and prolongation of life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d74","authors":["Perri, Tamar","Lantsberg, Daniel","Ben-Baruch, Gilad","Beiner, Mario E","Jakobson-Setton, Ariella","Korach, Jacob"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jemermed.2015.04.024","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T08:17:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0736-4679"],"journal":"Journal of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1436948235,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26149806\/"],"pmid":"26149806","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Malignant Pericardial Effusion in Ovarian Malignancy: A Treatable Oncologic Emergency.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8214150,"mean":6.9553653828225,"rank":6237107,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1105996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8214150,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227059,"mean":8.3867580794336,"rank":157137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":37840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227059,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1820,"mean":6.6111050027488,"rank":1461,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1820,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":7.6151891891892,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrMagicianEARL\/status\/621232042823385088","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4277750],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T08:17:15+00:00","author":{"name":"EARL\u22bf9\/13\u4e16\u754c\u6557\u8840\u75c7\u30c7\u30fc","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/904210438660931584\/yTRstDxQ_normal.jpg","description":"\u7740\u3005\u3068\u30d1\u30d5\u30e5\u30af\u30e9\u306b\u67d3\u307e\u308a\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u306e\u307b\u307b\u3093\u81e8\u5e8a\u7cfb\u30d6\u30ed\u30ac\u30fc\u533b\u3067\u3059\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u306f\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u30d0\u30a4\u30af\u6cbc\u306b\u3082\u5f15\u3063\u5f35\u308a\u3053\u307e\u308c\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u79c1\u3092\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30fc\u3059\u308b\u3068\u98ef\u30c6\u30ed\u3092\u304f\u3089\u3046\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3005\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u3042\u3089\u304b\u3058\u3081\u3054\u4e86\u627f\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u307e\u305f\u3001\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30ef\u30fc\u65701\u4e07\u8d85\u3048\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3042\u305f\u308a\u304b\u3089\u901a\u77e5\u6b04\u8ffd\u3044\u304d\u308c\u3066\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u30ea\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u306b\u6c17\u304c\u3064\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3005\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3054\u4e86\u627f\u4e0b\u3055\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"DrMagicianEARL","tweeter_id":"155482819","geo":{"lt":35.6895,"ln":139.69171,"country":"JP"},"followers":19653},"tweet_id":"621232042823385088"}]}}
