Minimally invasive therapies are increasingly being investigated in localized prostate cancer.\nIn this review, we discuss the current status of magnetic resonance imaging targeted fusion prostate biopsy and focal therapy for prostate cancer, its rationale, and techniques.\nFocal therapy offers a promising outlook for prostate cancer treatment, with the goal of effectively achieving cancer control while minimizing morbidity. Long term studies are needed.","altmetric_jid":"567962172a83ee58358b45cd","authors":["Susan Marshall","Samir Taneja"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.prnil.2015.03.007","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T09:15:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2287-8882"],"issue":"2","journal":"Prostate International","last_mentioned_on":1436951719,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4494637\/"],"pmcid":"PMC4494637","pmid":"26157765","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Asian Pacific Prostate Society","startpage":"35","title":"Focal therapy for prostate cancer: The current status","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/focal-therapy-prostate-cancer-current-status-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5357318,"mean":6.2702967810214,"rank":4459255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5357318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185372,"mean":8.5889248372185,"rank":149354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185372,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.721875,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":2.35,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
