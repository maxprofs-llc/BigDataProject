Abst #KTCG"],"citation":{"abstract":"Short height and obesity have each been associated with increased risk for preterm birth (PTB). However, the effect of short height on PTB risk, across different race\/ethnicities and BMI categories, has not been studied. Our objective was to determine the influence of maternal height on the risk for PTB within race\/ethnic groups, BMI groups, or adjusted for weight.\nAll California singleton, live births between 2007-2010 were included from birth certificate data (vital statistics) linked to hospital discharge data. Pre-pregnancy BMI (kg\/m(2)) was categorized as underweight (< 18.5); normal (18.5-24.9); overweight (25.0-29.9) or obese (\u226530.0). Maternal race\/ethnicity was categorized as: Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic and Asian. Maternal height was classified into 5 categories (shortest, short, middle, tall, tallest) based on racial\/ethnic-specific height distributions, with the middle category serving as reference. Poisson regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) for the association between maternal height and risk of spontaneous PTB (< 37 weeks and < 32 weeks). Models were stratified on race\/ethnicity and BMI. Generalized additive regression models (GAM) were used to detect nonlinearity of the association. Covariates considered were: maternal age, weight, parity, prenatal care, education, medical payment, previous PTB, gestational and pre-gestational diabetes, pre-gestational hypertension, preeclampsia\/eclampsia, and smoking.\nAmong 1,655,385 California singleton live births, 5.2% were spontaneous preterm births < 37 weeks. Short stature (1st height category) was associated with increased risk for PTB for Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics across all BMI categories. Among obese women, tall stature (5th category) was associated with reduced risk for spontaneous PTB for Non-Hispanic Whites, Asians and Hispanics. Same pattern of association was seen for height and risk for spontaneous PTB < 32 weeks. In the GAM plots, short stature was associated with increased risk for spontaneous PTB of < 32 and <37 weeks of gestation among Whites and Asians. However, this association was not observed for Blacks and Hispanics.\nMaternal shorter height is associated with a modest increased risk for spontaneous PTB regardless of BMI. Our results suggest that PTB risk assessment should consider race\/ethnicity specific height with respect to the norm in addition to BMI assessment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","authors":["Shachar, Bat Zion","Mayo, Jonathan A","Lee, Henry C","Carmichael, Suzan L","Stevenson, David K","Shaw, Gary M","Gould, Jeffery B"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajog.2015.07.005","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T00:49:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9378","1097-6868","00029378"],"journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1455816178,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(15)00721-8\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(15)00721-8\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0002937815007218?utm_source=hootsuite","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26187451"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002937815007218\/pdf","pmid":"26187451","pubdate":"2015-07-19T22:00:28+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Effects of race\/ethnicity and BMI on the association between height and risk for spontaneous preterm birth ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-raceethnicity-bmi-association-between-height-risk-spontaneous-preterm-birth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":1691237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5503271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":221768,"mean":8.0679662528691,"rank":64159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":156658,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":221768,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5089,"mean":7.1532488207547,"rank":1610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":3454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5089,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":5.4248235294118,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":5,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":4,"Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
