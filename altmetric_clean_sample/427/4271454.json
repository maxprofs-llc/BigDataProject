Characteristics and obstetric histories were obtained by self-report.\nThe mean age of the 202 participants at treatment was 30.7years (range 5-69). The mean duration of fistula was 45.6months (range 0-600). In total, 171 (91.4%) fistulas were caused by obstructed labor, and 147 (86.5%) were vesicovaginal. Most women (129\/175 [73.8%]) reported having received care during early labor under the supervision of a nurse or doctor in a healthcare facility. Among 176 women for whom delivery data were available, 102 (57.9%) delivered at a hospital, 42 (23.8%) at a health center, and 32 (18.2%) at home. Only 46 (26.3%) of 175 women were transferred to a higher level of care during labor.\nIn the eastern DRC, efforts to enable transport to a healthcare facility and to encourage attended births must be accompanied by improvements in the capacity of existing facilities and in the training of staff to enable the timely diagnosis of labor abnormalities and appropriate intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b55","authors":["Benfield, Nerys","Young-Lin, Nichole","Kimona, Christophe","Kalisya, Luc M","Kisindja, Rogatien M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijgo.2015.02.032","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T08:35:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-3479","0020-7292"],"journal":"International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics","last_mentioned_on":1439115922,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijgo.org\/article\/S0020-7292(15)00228-3\/fulltext"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijgo.org\/article\/S0020729215002283\/pdf","pmid":"26089287","pubdate":"2015-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Fistula after attended delivery and the challenge of obstetric care capacity in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fistula-after-attended-delivery-challenge-obstetric-care-capacity-eastern-democratic-republic-congo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5462004,"mean":6.3513590516133,"rank":3843667,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":917909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5462004,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189537,"mean":8.5342683817324,"rank":131899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":36848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189537,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1094,"mean":3.6212845379689,"rank":857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1094,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
