We investigated the role and mechanism of cellular repressor E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) in regulating TNF-\u03b1 induced inflammation response in macrophages and explore whether CREG might be a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.\nImmunostaining and Western Blotting showed that expression of CREG was reduced in human atherosclerotic coronary artery. In vivo experiments demonstrated that supplementation of recombinant CREG protein to ApoE(-\/-) mice fed with high fat diet alleviated aortic atherosclerosis development and inflammation. In vitro, macrophage from ApoE(-\/-) mice fed with high fat diet had lower level of CREG compared to control mice fed with normal diet. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting further confirmed that CREG inhibited inflammatory response of macrophages induced by TNF-\u03b1. Supplementation of exogenous recombinant CREG protein or CREG gene silencing showed that CREG promoted autophagy in TNF-\u03b1 treated macrophages. Use of autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A, identified that CREG attenuated TNF-\u03b1 induced inflammation by activate autophagy. In addition, supplementation of exogenous CREG protein stimulated expression and maturity of cathepsin B and cathepsin L and induced lysosome formation, whereas CREG deficiency reduced lysosomal formation.\nCREG inhibits inflammation and promotes autophagy mediated by lysosome formation; it might be a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e5b","authors":["Sun, Mingyu","Tian, Xiaoxiang","Liu, Yanxia","Zhu, Nan","Li, Yang","Yang, Guitang","Peng, Chengfei","Yan, Chenghui","Han, Yaling"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yjmcc.2015.07.001","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T10:23:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1095-8584"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular & Cellular Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1436955786,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26163874?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26163874","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:06:46+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","cardiology"],"title":"Cellular Repressor of E1A-Stimulated Genes inhibits inflammation to decrease atherosclerosis in ApoE(-\/-) mice.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cellular-repressor-e1astimulated-genes-inhibits-inflammation-decrease-atherosclerosis-apoe-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5357318,"mean":6.2702967810214,"rank":4459255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5357318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185372,"mean":8.5889234885717,"rank":149354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185372,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":605,"mean":2.1854536423841,"rank":411,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":605,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.6588235294118,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
