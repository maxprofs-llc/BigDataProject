The two isostructural lanthanide compounds [Ln(BTTP)3(OTf)3] (Ln = Eu (1), Sm (2); OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) were synthesized and fully characterized. The solid-state structures of both compounds were established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The complexation of Cm(III) and Eu(III) with BTTP in acetonitrile was studied using time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy. With increasing BTTP concentration Cm(III) 1:2 and 1:3 complexes and Eu(III) 1:1 and 1:3 complexes are identified. The conditional stability constants of the 1:3 complex species with BTTP are log \u03b23 = 14.0 for Cm(III) and log \u03b23 = 10.3 for Eu(III). Both M(III) 1:3 complexes are prone to decomplexation with increasing acidity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Claude Kiefer"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00803","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T00:28:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1436915162,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00803"],"pmid":"26168381","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:03:39+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"A Complexation Study of 2,6-Bis(1-(p-tolyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine Using Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction and TRLFS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complexation-study-26bis1-ipi-tolyl1-ihi-123triazol4ylpyridine-using-singlecrystal-xray-diffraction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5352377,"mean":6.2635557475804,"rank":2842191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1818177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5352377,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185882,"mean":8.5760448889345,"rank":102268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65393,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185882,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7557,"mean":1.0488959767073,"rank":1995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4898,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7557,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":1.062426035503,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/status\/620751586956939264","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4270162],"posted_on":"2015-07-14T00:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1297},"tweet_id":"620751586956939264"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/InorgChem\/status\/620939082156376064","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4270162],"posted_on":"2015-07-14T12:53:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/IC","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2249495742\/ic-twitter_normal.jpg","description":"Editor-in-Chief Bill Tolman and IC staff on fundamental studies in all phases of inorganic chemistry, including bioinorganic chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorgChem","tweeter_id":"583802897","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":5831},"tweet_id":"620939082156376064"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Tolma001\/status\/621093326243041280","license":"datasift","rt":["InorgChem"],"citation_ids":[4270162],"posted_on":"2015-07-14T23:06:02+00:00","author":{"name":"William Tolman","url":"http:\/\/www.chem.umn.edu\/groups\/tolman","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/832271105985372160\/lrRpmPma_normal.jpg","description":"Professor and Chair of Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota; Editor-in-Chief of Inorganic Chemistry; Dad; bicyclist; fan of Mpls","id_on_source":"Tolma001","tweeter_id":"28503759","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1966},"tweet_id":"621093326243041280"}]}}
