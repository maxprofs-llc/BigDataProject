The search for effective biological control agents targeting P. destructans is of great importance. We report that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol, which is also a Candida albicans quorum sensing compound, prevented in vitro conidial germination for at least 14\u00a0days and inhibited growth of preexisting hyphae of five P. destructans isolates in filtered potato dextrose broth at 10\u00a0\u00b0C. Depending on the inoculation concentrations, both spore and hyphal inhibition occurred upon exposure to concentrations as low as 15-20\u00a0\u00b5M trans, trans-farnesol. In contrast, most North American Pseudogymnoascus isolates were more tolerant to the exposure of trans, trans-farnesol. Our results suggest that some Candida isolates may have the potential to inhibit the growth of P. destructans and that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol has the potential to be utilized as a biological control agent.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000669c","authors":["Raudabaugh, Daniel B","Miller, Andrew N"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11046-015-9921-2","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T10:24:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-0832"],"journal":"Mycopathologia","last_mentioned_on":1472206668,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26162644?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11046-015-9921-2"],"pmid":"26162644","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:07:32+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Eukaryotic Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Effect of Trans, Trans-Farnesol on Pseudogymnoascus destructans and Several Closely Related Species","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-trans-transfarnesol-pseudogymnoascus-destructans-several-closely-related-species"},"altmetric_score":{"score":37,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":37},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8330948,"mean":7.0224737151655,"rank":247278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8083168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8330948,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227696,"mean":8.4099962405851,"rank":9332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":218348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227696,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":553,"mean":2.1360072463768,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":551,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":553,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.47058823529412,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"PK":1,"AU":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/QSPapers\/status\/621263949770559488","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4278389],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T10:24:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Quorum Sensing","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507853503956402176\/VuBr1wau_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweetbot serving the world by providing links to the latest published papers on bacterial quorum sensing.
