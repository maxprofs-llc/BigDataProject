The protein(s)\/sequence(s) that comprise this group are representative of all major kingdoms of life, and catalyze a generic hydroxylation, which is, in most cases accompanied by a specialized conversion of the substrate molecule. Iron is an essential co-factor for this transformation and the response to waning levels is systemic, and mandates the simultaneous participation of molecular sensors, transporters, and signal transducers. Here, I present a proof-of-concept model, that an evolving molecular network of 2OG-dependent enzymes can maintain iron homeostasis in the cytosol of root hair cells of members of the family Gramineae by actuating a non-reductive compensatory chelation by the phytosiderophores. Regression models of empirically available kinetic data (iron and alpha-ketoglutarate) were formulated, analyzed, and compared. The results, when viewed in context of the superfamily responding as a unit, suggest that members can indeed, work together to accomplish system-level function. This is achieved by the establishment of transient metabolic conduits, wherein the flux is dictated by kinetic compatibility of the participating enzymes. The approach adopted, i.e., predictive mathematical modeling, is integral to the hypothesis-driven acquisition of experimental data points and, in association with suitable visualization aids may be utilized for exploring complex plant biochemical systems.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Kundu, Siddhartha"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2015.00489","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T13:32:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1436967131,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2015.00489\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2015.00489\/pdf","pmid":"26236316","pubdate":"2015-07-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Co-operative intermolecular kinetics of 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases may be essential for system-level regulation of plant cell physiology","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cooperative-intermolecular-kinetics-2oxoglutarate-dependent-dioxygenases-essential-systemlevel-regul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5357329,"mean":6.2702057361452,"rank":4459168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5357329,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185371,"mean":8.5889465717216,"rank":149355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185371,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3518,"mean":2.1737236280921,"rank":2259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3518,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":1.867520361991,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
