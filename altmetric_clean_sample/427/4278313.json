These cell lines were developed for later differentiation into germ lineage cells and elucidation of the signaling pathways involved. The cell lines were established from inner cell masses (ICMs) that were isolated manually from the in vitro-produced blastocysts. Most of the ICMs (45-55%) resulted in formation of primary colonies that were subcultured after 8-10 days, leading subsequently to the formation of three buESC lines, one from each blastocyst type. All the cell lines expressed stem cell markers, such as Alkaline Phosphatase, OCT4, NANOG, SSEA1, SSEA4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SOX2, REX1, CD-90, STAT3, and TELOMERASE. They differentiated into all three germ layers as determined by ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal RNA and protein markers. All of the cell lines showed equal expression of pluripotency markers as well as equivalent differentiation potential into all the three germ layers. The static suspension culture-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) showed greater expression of all the three germ layer markers as compared to hanging drop culture-derived EBs. When analyzed for germ layer marker expression, EBs derived from 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-based spontaneous differentiation medium showed greater differentiation across all the three germ layers as compared to those derived from Knock-Out Serum Replacement (KoSR)-based differentiation medium.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024ce","authors":["Shah, Syed Mohmad","Saini, Neha","Ashraf, Syma","Zandi, Mohammad","Manik, Radhey Sham","Singla, Suresh Kumar","Palta, Prabhat","Chauhan, Manmohan Singh"],"doi":"10.1089\/cell.2014.0098","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T10:19:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2152-4998"],"journal":"Cellular Reprogramming","last_mentioned_on":1436955546,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26168169?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26168169","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:03:45+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Development, Characterization, and Pluripotency Analysis of Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Derived from In Vitro-Fertilized, Hand-Guided Cloned, and Parthenogenetic Embryos.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-characterization-pluripotency-analysis-buffalo-ibubalus-bubalisi-embryonic-stem-cell-lin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5357318,"mean":6.2702967810214,"rank":4459255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5357318,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185372,"mean":8.5889248372185,"rank":149354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185372,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":2.0336989247312,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.0625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/status\/621262707858116608","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4278313],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T10:19:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":56},"tweet_id":"621262707858116608"}]}}
