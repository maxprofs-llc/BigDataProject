Some susceptibility artifact is apparent at the bone-air interfaces as expected at 3.0 T.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c0f","authors":["Mansfield, P","Coxon, R","Glover, P"],"first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T09:07:11+00:00","issns":["0363-8715"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography","last_mentioned_on":1472703282,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8188896","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8188896"],"pmid":"8188896","pubdate":"1994-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology"],"title":"Echo-planar imaging of the brain at 3.0 T: first normal volunteer results.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/echoplanar-imaging-brain-30-t-first-normal-volunteer-results"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314034,"mean":7.0059620328577,"rank":2125615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5054612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314034,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227616,"mean":8.4071452320805,"rank":68363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":154698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227616,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1172,"mean":1.1788112724167,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1019,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1172,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=666740543#altmetric_citation_04f62bed-4794-44f9-8bcf-c9d6fed24049","license":"public","citation_ids":[4277871],"posted_on":"2015-06-13T09:33:15+00:00","summary":"The first MR images of a human brain were obtained in 1978 by two groups of researchers at EMI Laboratories leaded by Ian Robert Young and Hugh Clow.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=31940936","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Gcastellanos","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Gcastellanos"}},{"title":"Timeline of brain cancer","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=737169283#altmetric_citation_93a0d15b-2e72-4207-8c89-be10a248c5b0","license":"public","citation_ids":[4277871],"posted_on":"2016-09-01T04:14:42+00:00","summary":"This is a timeline of brain cancer, describing especially major discoveries, advances in treatment and major organizations.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=51482320","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Wikisanchez","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Wikisanchez"}}]}}
