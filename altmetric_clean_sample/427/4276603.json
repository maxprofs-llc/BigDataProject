All treatment decisions, including medication choice, were left to the discretion of the treating physician. The rates of treatment response, relapse, and 6-month sustained remission were compared between olanzapine monotherapy (OLZ) and other anti-psychotic monotherapy (OAN), and between OLZ and other atypical antipsychotic monotherapy (OAT). Visit-wise comparisons of treatment response and remission were examined using repeated-measures logistic regressions. Propensity scores were used to control for potential baseline differences between groups.\nResponse rates were higher for OLZ patients and relapse rates were consistently lower for OLZ patients, however the differences were not statistically significant. Rates of 6-month sustained remission were significantly higher for OLZ than OAN patients (P=0.032) and for OLZ than OAT patients (P=0.041). An exploratory analysis of OLZ and OAN comparison found outpatients treated with OLZ or OAN had similar sustained remission rates (OLZ: 22.2%, OAN: 22.8%), while inpatients treated with OLZ had significantly higher sustained remission rates than inpatients treated with OAN (OLZ: 17.1%, OAN: 6.6%, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] =3.54 [2.00-6.25]).\nIn usual care in Japan, treating the acute symptoms of schizophrenia with olanzapine was not found to be significantly different for response and relapse rates; however, treatment with olanzapine was found to have significantly greater sustained remission rates than treatment with other antipsychotics. In the inpatient setting, where patients tend to be more severe and difficult to manage, olanzapine treatment may lead to higher sustained remission rates than other antipsychotics.","authors":["Michihiro Takahashi","Shinji Fujikoshi","Naohiro Nakahara","Masaomi Iyo"],"doi":"10.2147\/por.s64973","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T01:30:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1179-7266"],"journal":"Pragmatic and Observational Research","last_mentioned_on":1436925691,"links":["http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/remission-response-and-relapse-rates-in-patients-with-acute-schizophre-peer-reviewed-article-POR"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/getfile.php?fileID=25946","pmid":"27774031","pubdate":"2015-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Dove Press","title":"Remission, response, and relapse rates in patients with acute schizophrenia treated with olanzapine monotherapy or other atypical antipsychotic monotherapy: 12-month prospective observational study","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/remission-response-relapse-rates-patients-acute-schizophrenia-treated-olanzapine-monotherapy-other-a"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Neuroscience":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DoveEpidem\/status\/621129598021971969","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4276603],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T01:30:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Epidemiology","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=8","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294779226\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest Epidemiology and Public Health articles published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DoveEpidem","tweeter_id":"53262268","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":100},"tweet_id":"621129598021971969"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DovePatient\/status\/621137487612653568","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4276603],"posted_on":"2015-07-15T02:01:31+00:00","author":{"name":"Dove Press Patient","url":"http:\/\/www.dovepress.com\/browse_journals.php?pa=view&cat_id=23","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/294760240\/DoveLogoBlock-75_normal.jpg","description":"Latest articles covering all areas of patient care, published in Dove Press open access medical and scientific journals","id_on_source":"DovePatient","tweeter_id":"53258840","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"621137487612653568"}]}}
