The target compounds, which were assayed in binding experiments and electrophysiological, functional and Erk1\/2 activation tests, essentially combined the pharmacological profiles of their individual receptor ligands. Among the studied derivatives, hybrid 2, one of the shortest homologs, in addition to the antagonist nicotinic profile similar to the other three congeners, behaved as a high affinity ligand at the investigated heteromeric nAChRs and as a low efficacy agonist at D2Rs. These bifunctional derivatives represent novel pharmacological tools in the study of nicotine addiction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Matera, Carlo","Pucci, Luca","Fiorentini, Chiara","Fucile, Sergio","Missale, Cristina","Grazioso, Giovanni","Clementi, Francesco","Zoli, Michele","De Amici, Marco","Gotti, Cecilia","Dallanoce, Clelia","Carlo Matera","Luca Pucci","Chiara Fiorentini","Sergio Fucile","Cristina Missale","Giovanni Grazioso","Francesco Clementi","Michele Zoli","Marco De Amici","Cecilia Gotti","Clelia Dallanoce"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2015.06.039","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T10:23:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1768-3254","02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1491765703,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26164842?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ejmech.2015.06.039"],"pmid":"26164842","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:05:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Bifunctional compounds targeting both D2 and non-\u03b17 nACh receptors: Design, synthesis and pharmacological characterization.","type":"article","volume":"101","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bifunctional-compounds-targeting-both-d2and-non%CE%B17-nach-receptors-design-synthesis-pharmacological-ch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8029393,"mean":6.8051641093086,"rank":1928588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6062773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8029393,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":226177,"mean":8.29321202957,"rank":64549,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":160391,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":226177,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1105,"mean":1.787009057971,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":957,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1105,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.0854166666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
