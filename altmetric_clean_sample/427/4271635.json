Among them, heme has been shown to play a role in the pathophysiology of severe malaria in rodents but its role in human severe malaria remains unclear. Circulating levels of total heme and its main scavenger, hemopexin, along with cytokine\/chemokine levels and biological parameters, including hemoglobin and creatinine levels as well as transaminase activities, were measured in the plasma of 237 P. falciparum-infected patients living in the malaria-endemic state of Odisha, India. All patients were categorized into well-defined groups of mild malaria, cerebral malaria (CM) or severe non-cerebral malaria, which included acute renal failure (ARF) and hepatopathy. Our results show a significant increase in total plasma heme levels with malaria severity, especially for CM and malarial ARF. Spearman rank correlation and canonical correlation analyses have shown a correlation between total heme, hemopexin, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3-induced protein (IP)-10, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 levels. In addition, canonical correlations revealed that heme, along with IP-10, was associated with the CM pathophysiology whereas both IP-10 and MCP-1 together with heme discriminated ARF. Altogether, our data indicate that heme, in association with cytokines and chemokines, is involved in the pathophysiology of both CM and ARF but through different mechanisms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f610007771","authors":["Esther Dalko","Bidyut Das","Fabien Herbert","Constantin Fesel","Sulabha Pathak","Rina Tripathy","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Cazenave","Balachandran Ravindran","Shobhona Sharma","Sylviane Pied","Dalko, Esther","Das, Bidyut","Herbert, Fabien","Fesel, Constantin","Pathak, Sulabha","Tripathy, Rina","Cazenave, Pierre-Andr\u00e9","Ravindran, Balachandran","Sharma, Shobhona","Pied, Sylviane"],"doi":"10.1128\/iai.00531-15","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T10:00:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1098-5522","0019-9567"],"journal":"Infection and Immunity","last_mentioned_on":1496948221,"links":["http:\/\/iai.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/08\/IAI.00531-15.abstract?RESULTFORMAT=&andorexactfulltext=and&andorexacttitle=and&andorexacttitleabs=and&ct=&fulltext=malaria&hits=12&maxtoshow=&resourcetype=HWCIT&searchid=1&usestrictdates=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26169278?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/iai.asm.org\/content\/83\/10\/3793.full?maxtoshow=&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=%253F%253F%253F%253F&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=228&sortspec=date&resourcetype=HWFIG"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/iai.asm.org\/content\/early\/2015\/07\/08\/IAI.00531-15.full.pdf","pmid":"26169278","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:03:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Multifaceted roles of heme during severe Plasmodium falciparum infections in India","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multifaceted-roles-heme-during-severe-plasmodium-falciparum-infections-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":6028376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2010321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":228308,"mean":8.4048007288432,"rank":144703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":70173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":228308,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2850,"mean":3.8730031590032,"rank":2052,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":714,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2850,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":5.1511139240506,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":18}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
