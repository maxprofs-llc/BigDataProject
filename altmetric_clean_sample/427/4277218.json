They completed validated measures of beliefs about the 'harm' and 'overuse' of medications in general (BMQ General); 'concerns' about and 'necessity' of current diabetes medications (BMQ Specific); negative insulin therapy appraisals (ITAS); depression (PHQ-9); anxiety (GAD-7), and diabetes distress (DDS-17). Factors associated with ITAS Negative scores were examined using hierarchical multiple regressions.\nTwenty-two percent of the variance in ITAS Negative scores (52\u00b110), was explained by: number of complications (\u03b2=-.15, p=.005), DDS-17 subscale 'emotional burden' (\u03b2=.23, p<.001), and 'concerns' about current diabetes treatment (\u03b2=.29, p<.001). General beliefs about medications and general emotional wellbeing did not contribute significantly to the model.\nPsychological insulin resistance may reflect broader distress about diabetes and concerns about its treatment but not general beliefs about medicines, depression or anxiety. Reducing diabetes distress and current treatment concerns may improve attitudes towards insulin as a potential therapeutic option.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f6100085c1","authors":["Holmes-Truscott, E","Skinner, T C","Pouwer, F","Speight, J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pcd.2015.06.006","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T03:52:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-0210","17519918"],"journal":"Primary Care Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1455850453,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1751991815000923","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26150327"],"pmid":"26150327","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare","endocrinology"],"title":"Explaining psychological insulin resistance in adults with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes: The roles of diabetes distress and current medication concerns.
