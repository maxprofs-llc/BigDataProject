Accordingly, we hypothesized that PFO+ subjects would have a higher core temperature than PFO- subjects due, in part, to absence of respiratory system cooling of the shunted blood and that this effect would be dependent upon the estimated PFO size and inspired air temperature. Subjects were screened for the presence and size of a PFO using saline contrast echocardiography. Thirty well-matched males (15 PFO-, 8 Large PFO+, 7 Small PFO+) completed cycle ergometer exercise trials on three separate days. Trial 1, subjects completed a VO2MAX test. For Trials 2 and 3, randomized, subjects completed four 2.5\u00a0min stages at 25, 50, 75 and 90% of the maximum workload achieved during Trial 1, breathing either ambient air (20.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00b0C) or cold air (1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00b0C). PFO+ subjects had a higher oesophageal temperature (Toesoph ) (p < .05) than PFO- subjects on Trial 1. During exercise breathing cold and dry air, PFO+ subjects achieved a higher Toesoph than PFO- subjects (p < .05). Subjects with a large PFO, but not small, had a higher Toesoph than PFO- subjects (p < .05) during Trial 1 and increased Toesoph breathing cold and dry air. These data suggest that the presence and size of a PFO are associated with Toesoph in healthy humans but this is explained only partially by absence of respiratory system cooling of shunted blood.
