In-person interviews were conducted with 1,000 residents in Seoul, Korea, in 2011. The authors found that respondents' functional health literacy had positive effects on the scope of health information sources and health information self-efficacy but not health information-seeking intention. Respondents' social capital had positive effects on the scope of health information sources, health information efficacy, and health information-seeking intention. The authors found (a) a significant moderation effect of bridging social capital on the relation between health literacy and health information self-efficacy and (b) a moderation effect of bonding social capital on the relation between health literacy and health information-seeking intention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013f4","authors":["Kim, Yong-Chan","Lim, Ji Young","Park, Keeho"],"doi":"10.1080\/10810730.2015.1018636","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T15:00:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1087-0415"],"journal":"Journal of Health Communication","last_mentioned_on":1447239604,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26166008","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10810730.2015.1018636","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26166008?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26166008","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:05:24+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Effects of Health Literacy and Social Capital on Health Information Behavior.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-health-literacy-social-capital-health-information-behavior-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6559289,"mean":6.0768461753774,"rank":1102050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5451636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6559289,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194649,"mean":8.6712156097162,"rank":45340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":149033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194649,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":582,"mean":7.8511979345955,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":582,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":7.1352258064516,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
