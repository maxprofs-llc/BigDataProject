In this report, the synthesis, characterization, and angiogenic properties of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated, observed through several in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays. The results here demonstrate that the intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species as well as activation of phospho-eNOS and phospho-Akt might be the plausible mechanisms for GO and rGO induced angiogenesis. The results altogether suggest the possibilities for the development of alternative angiogenic therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular related diseases where angiogenesis plays a significant role.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006894","authors":["Mukherjee, Sudip","Sriram, Pavithra","Barui, Ayan Kumar","Nethi, Susheel Kumar","Veeriah, Vimal","Chatterjee, Suvro","Suresh, Kattimuttathu Ittara","Patra, Chitta Ranjan"],"doi":"10.1002\/adhm.201500155","endpage":"1732","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T02:55:14+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2192-2659"],"issue":"11","journal":"Advanced Healthcare Materials","last_mentioned_on":1436834700,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201500155\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/adhm.201500155"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/adhm.201500155\/pdf","pmid":"26033847","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"1722","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Graphene Oxides Show Angiogenic Properties","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/graphene-oxides-show-angiogenic-properties"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5347972,"mean":6.2583700902662,"rank":769282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4533111,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5347972,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185836,"mean":8.5746052035409,"rank":35700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":148743,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185836,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":674,"mean":5.7303506686478,"rank":141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":674,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.8451428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
