The electromyogram and the muscle biopsy play a key role in the evaluation of asymptomatic hyperckemia. The objective of this study was to investigate asymptomatic individuals with increased creatine kinase levels.\nWe comparatively studied electromyogram, quantitative electromyogram and muscle biopsy in asymptomatic clinically normal individuals with repeatedly increased creatine kinase levels.\nConventional electromyogram was abnormal in 76% of patients, while quantitative electromyogram showed abnormal results in 88.9%. Muscle biopsy was diagnostic in 28%, one patient had neurogenic findings, 40% showed non specific changes and 28% had normal results.\nElectromyogram and especially quantitative electromyogram are highly sensitive in detecting subclinical neuromuscular diseases, whereas muscle biopsy may better contribute in the final diagnosis. No strong correlations were found between histological abnormalities and electrophysiological data, but further research is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e78","authors":["Kokotis, P","Papadimas, G K","Zouvelou, V","Zambelis, T","Manta, P","Karandreas, N"],"doi":"10.3109\/00207454.2015.1038534","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T15:24:04+00:00","issns":["1563-5279"],"journal":"International Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1436883637,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/00207454.2015.1038534?ai=1lj8&mi=445h7u&af=R&"],"pmid":"26000931","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Electrodiagnosis and muscle biopsy in asymptomatic hyperckemia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electrodiagnosis-muscle-biopsy-asymptomatic-hyperckemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5352377,"mean":6.2635557475804,"rank":4455287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5352377,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":185883,"mean":8.5760060145686,"rank":149759,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":185883,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":612,"mean":3.6387757774141,"rank":490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":612,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.695,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/psych2evidence\/status\/620961097130967040","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4272051],"posted_on":"2015-07-14T14:20:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Psych2 Evidence","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/590651515787993088\/48DTFkEi_normal.jpg","description":"Real-time Evidence-Based Psychiatry Online #ebm #digital #technology #evidence #psychiatry #mentalhealth #futuremedicine Dr Naik @UniofOxford EBHC Student","id_on_source":"psych2evidence","tweeter_id":"3192717557","geo":{"lt":51.75222,"ln":-1.25596,"country":"GB"},"followers":965},"tweet_id":"620961097130967040"}]}}
