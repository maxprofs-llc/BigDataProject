Here we describe the histopathological features of the cutaneous DTH reaction and its association with intestinal pathology and systemic immune responses in sheep with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. A mixed mononuclear cellular infiltrate dominated the DTH reaction and was present in perivascular and periadnexal patterns. Multiple multinucleate giant cells were present in the cellular infiltrate in one sheep while plasma cells were an obvious feature in six others. Sheep with paucibacillary intestinal lesions had the greatest degrees of cutaneous induration, more severe cellular infiltration in DTH lesions and high systemic interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production. In contrast, sheep with multibacillary intestinal lesions, and particularly those with dissemination of MAP to extra-intestinal tissues, had minimal cutaneous induration, nil to mild cellular infiltration in DTH lesions and high serum anti-MAP antibody levels. Systemic IFN-\u03b3 production generally was augmented following skin sensitization. In general, the gross and histopathological features of the cutaneous DTH response matched the stage of paratuberculosis reflected by intestinal pathology and systemic measures of humoral and cellular immunity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c03","authors":["Gulliver, E L","Plain, K M","Begg, D J","Whittington, R J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jcpa.2015.05.005","first_seen_on":"2015-07-15T10:06:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-3129","00219975"],"journal":"Journal of Comparative Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1440132066,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26164087?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021997515000973"],"pmid":"26164087","pubdate":"2015-07-15T22:06:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Histopathological Characterization of Cutaneous Delayed-type Hypersensitivity and Correlations with Intestinal Pathology and Systemic Immune Responses in Sheep with Paratuberculosis ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histopathological-characterization-cutaneous-delayedtype-hypersensitivity-correlations-intestinal-pa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5568281,"mean":6.3316453235122,"rank":2258779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3280796,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5568281,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":189806,"mean":8.5510004162167,"rank":73685,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":114607,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":189806,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":415,"mean":1.6516618357488,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":415,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.6875,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
