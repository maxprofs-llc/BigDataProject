However, its epidemiology is relatively unknown, largely due to the paucity of specifically designed population studies. This systematic review aims to assess the prevalence and incidence of iNPH.\nWe conducted a systematic literature review on the epidemiology of iNPH using PubMed\/Medline until June 2014.\nTwenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria. Twelve were specifically designed for detecting cases of iNPH; however, only four were prospective. In people over 65 years old, pooled prevalence obtained from specific population studies was 1.3%, almost 50-fold higher than that inferred from door-to-door surveys of dementia or Parkinsonism. Prevalence may be even higher in assisted-living and extended-care residents, with up to 11.6% of patients fulfilling the criteria for suspected iNPH and 2.0% of patients showing permanent improvement after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. The only prospective population-based survey that reported iNPH incidence estimated 1.20 cases\/1000 inhabitants\/year, 15-fold higher than estimates obtained from studies based on hospital catchment areas. The incidence of shunt surgery for iNPH and SRiNPH obtained from incident cases of hospital catchment areas appears to be fewer than two cases and one case\/100,000 inhabitants\/year, respectively. Unfortunately, there is no population-based study reporting the real values for these two parameters.\nWe conclude that iNPH appears to be extremely under-diagnosed. Properly designed and adequately powered population-based studies are required to accurately characterize this disease's epidemiology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008d13","authors":["Mart\u00edn-L\u00e1ez, Rub\u00e9n","Caballero-Arzapalo, Hugo","L\u00f3pez-Men\u00e9ndez, Luis \u00c1ngel","Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos","V\u00e1zquez-Barquero, Alfonso"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.wneu.2015.07.005","first_seen_on":"2015-07-14T10:48:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-8750"],"journal":"World Neurosurgery","last_mentioned_on":1437696000,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1878875015008712","http:\/\/www.worldneurosurgery.org\/article\/S1878-8750(15)00871-2\/abstract?rss=yes","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26183137"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.worldneurosurgery.org\/article\/S1878875015008712\/pdf","pmid":"26183137","pubdate":"2015-07-18T22:01:52+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","subjects":["neurosurgery"],"title":"Epidemiology of Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus: A Systematic Review of the Literature.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epidemiology-idiopathic-normal-pressure-hydrocephalus-systematic-review-literature-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5393711,"mean":6.2953748280863,"rank":433081,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":4957790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5393711,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187000,"mean":8.5711481237869,"rank":22050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":164805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187000,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":619,"mean":2.1816051779935,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":619,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":4.4842105263158,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
