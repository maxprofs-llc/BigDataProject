However, the in vivo integrated metabolism of its multiple components remains unknown. In this paper, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) method was developed for detection and identification of HLXLD metabolites in rat urine at high and normal clinical dosages. The prototype constituents and their metabolites in urine were analyzed. The mass measurements were accurate within 8 ppm, and subsequent fragment ions offered higher quality structural information for interpretation of the fragmentation pathways of various compounds. A total of 85 compounds were detected in high dosages urine samples by a highly sensitive extracted ion chromatograms method, including 31 parent compounds and 54 metabolites. Our results indicated that phase II reactions (e.g., glucuronidation, glutathionidation, and sulfation) were the main metabolic pathways of lactones, alkaloids and flavones, while phase I reactions (e.g., hydrogenation and hydroxylation) were the major metabolic reaction for coumarins, paeoniflorin and iridoids. This investigation provided important structural information on the metabolism of HLXLD and provided scientific evidence to obtain a more comprehensive metabolic profile.
