Scarcity of pertinent data, however, makes it hard to determine whether accident characteristics, causal factors and remedial interventions identified elsewhere apply to the Gulf in comparable ways. This difficulty stems from unusual construction sector characteristics, notably a heterogeneous mix of expatriate laborers and firms working without a common language, work culture or labor practices. Does this change the mix of accident types or the ranking of main causes and priority remedies? To answer this question, a sample of 519 incident records was analyzed to determine whether accident types and frequencies are comparable to elsewhere. Site safety experts were then interviewed to determine whether rankings of factors and interventions should be similar. Findings are that types are indeed comparable, but the rankings of factors and interventions may not be. Main factors have to do with worker skills and training, experience, use of safety gear and risk perception. The overarching safety issue, however, is that firms and governments do not have strong incentive to address these factors.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022d2","authors":["Fass, Simon","Yousef, Rami","Liginlal, Divakaran","Vyas, Priyanka","Simon Fass","Rami Yousef","Divakaran Liginlal","Priyanka Vyas"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.apergo.2016.05.002","endpage":"526","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T09:47:52+00:00","issns":["1872-9126","00036870"],"journal":"Applied Ergonomics","last_mentioned_on":1476372554,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.apergo.2016.05.002"],"pmid":"27211607","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Design Practice And Management","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"515","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Understanding causes of fall and struck-by incidents: What differentiates construction safety in the Arabian Gulf region?","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0003687016300898","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/understanding-causes-fall-struckby-incidents-differentiates-construction-safety-arabian-gulf-region"},"altmetric_score":{"score":24,"score_history":{"1y":24,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":24},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7534762,"mean":6.5107844469081,"rank":305623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":7227303,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7534762,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244534,"mean":12.168125300061,"rank":18594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":225866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244534,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":6.7362125748503,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":4.3454545454545,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
