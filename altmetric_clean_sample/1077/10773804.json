Partly due to the strong interlayer coupling between 2D nanosheets, it results in face-to-face stacking rather than an edge-to-edge coupling. We demonstrate, for the first time, how one can induce and control an edge-to-edge self-assembly process for 2D nanomaterials. Attributed to extremely weak van der Waals coupling along with strong anisotropy of ReS2, it allows us to realize a scalable and oriented self-assembly (OSA) process. We can accurately control the aspect ratio of the ReS2 nanoscrolls. In addition, we perform simulations to further explain and confirm the OSA process, demonstrating its great potential to be expanded as a general edge-to-edge self-assembly process suitable for other 2D nanomaterials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Zhang, Qin","Wang, Wenjie","Kong, Xin","Mendes, Rafael G","Fang, Liwen","Xue, Yinghui","Xiao, Yao","R\u00fcmmeli, Mark Hermann","Chen, Shengli","Fu, Lei"],"doi":"10.1021\/jacs.6b06368","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T10:40:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-5126"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1471948813,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27547983?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27547983","pubdate":"2016-08-23T22:02:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Edge-to-edge Oriented Self-assembly of ReS2 Nanoflakes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/edgetoedge-oriented-selfassembly-res2-nanoflakes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":6271889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1117211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253430,"mean":12.378808478903,"rank":180249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":39740,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253430,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19134,"mean":5.2826363873935,"rank":15694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":2135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19134,"percentile":11},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":507,"mean":7.3323201581028,"rank":377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":507,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
