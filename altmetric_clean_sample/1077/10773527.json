We applied a new unbiased deep-sequencing method for TCR repertoire analysis to accurately measure and compare receptor diversity and clonal expansions within the peripheral and CSF-trafficking T-cell populations of patients with MS and control individuals with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).\nPaired blood and CSF TCR \u03b2-chain libraries from five MS patients and five IIH controls were sequenced, yielding a total of 80 million reads.\nAlthough TCR repertoire diversity was greater in the blood and CSF compartments of MS patients when compared with IIH controls, it is notable that the frequency of clonal expansions was also significantly higher in both compartments of MS patients. Highly expanded T-cell clones were enriched in the CSF compartment of MS patients compared to peripheral blood, very few of them were detected in both compartments.\nCollectively, our data provide a proof of principle that private compartmentalized T-cell expansion exists in the intrathecal space of MS patients.","altmetric_jid":"53222bcf2a83eefa4a8b4567","authors":["de Paula Alves Sousa, Alessandra","Johnson, Kory R","Nicholas, Richard","Darko, Sam","Price, David A","Douek, Daniel C","Jacobson, Steven","Muraro, Paolo A"],"doi":"10.1002\/acn3.310","endpage":"433","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T10:33:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2328-9503"],"issue":"6","journal":"Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1472104800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27547770?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27547770"],"pmid":"27547770","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"422","title":"Intrathecal T-cell clonal expansions in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intrathecal-tcell-clonal-expansions-patients-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.554,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.554},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":1033187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7243793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253531,"mean":12.378561945332,"rank":45809,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":207719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253531,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":13.436207142857,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":194,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":33.836142857143,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1,"ZA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/768033356940349440","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10773527],"posted_on":"2016-08-23T10:33:16+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":210},"tweet_id":"768033356940349440"}],"blogs":[{"title":"Clonal Expansions in MS Society","url":"http:\/\/multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com\/2016\/08\/clonal-expansions-in-ms-society.html","license":"public","citation_ids":[10773527],"posted_on":"2016-08-25T06:00:00+00:00","summary":"de Paula Alves Sousa A, Johnson KR, Nicholas R, Darko S, Price DA, Douek DC, Jacobson S, Muraro PA.Intrathecal T-cell clonal expansions in patients with multiple sclerosis.Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2016 Apr 20;3(6):422-33.OBJECTIVE:Analysis of the T-cell rec","author":{"name":"Multiple Sclerosis Research","url":"http:\/\/multiple-sclerosis-research.blogspot.com\/","description":"A blog for people with MS and their families, by Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry."}}]}}
