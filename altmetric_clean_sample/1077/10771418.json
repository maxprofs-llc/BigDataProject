With 47 homologues in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were reported, but the individual and integrated functions of aquaporins involved in drought response remains unclear. Here, three plasma membrane intrinsic protein genes, SlPIP2;1, SlPIP2;7 and SlPIP2;5, were identified as candidate aquaporins genes because of highly expressed in tomato roots. Assay on expression in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that SlPIP2s protein displayed water channel activity and facilitated water transport into the cells. With real-time PCR and in situ hybridization analysis, SlPIP2s were considered to be involved in response to drought treatment. To test its function, transgenic Arabidopsis and tomato lines overexpressing SlPIP2;1, SlPIP2;7 or SlPIP2;5 were generated. Compared with wild type, the over-expression of SlPIP2;1, SlPIP2;7 or SlPIP2;5 transgenic Arabidopsis and tomato plants all showed significantly higher hydraulic conductivity levels and survival rates under both normal and drought conditions. Taken together, this study concludes that aquaporins (SlPIP2;1, SlPIP2;7 and SlPIP2;5) contribute substantially to root water uptake in tomato plants through improving plant water content and maintaining osmotic balance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Li, Ren","Wang, Jinfang","Li, Shuangtao","Zhang, Lei","Qi, Chuandong","Weeda, Sarah","Zhao, Bing","Ren, Shuxin","Guo, Yang-Dong"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep31814","first_seen_on":"2016-08-23T10:03:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1471948930,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27545827?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27545827?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27545827","pubdate":"2016-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Abiotic","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Drought","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"31814","subjects":["science"],"title":"Plasma Membrane Intrinsic Proteins SlPIP2;1, SlPIP2;7 and SlPIP2;5 Conferring Enhanced Drought Stress Tolerance in Tomato","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/plasma-membrane-intrinsic-proteins-slpip21-slpip27-slpip25-conferring-enhanced-drought-stress-tolera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4155945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3899050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253430,"mean":12.378802560086,"rank":128531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253430,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35507,"mean":14.760090519912,"rank":18862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":15029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35507,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3251,"mean":17.046820307692,"rank":1713,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":1395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3251,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
