Moreover, metformin alone was less effective in NHB versus NHW versus H youth. This study describes treatment-associated changes in adiponectin, insulin sensitivity, and \u03b2-cell function over time among the three racial\/ethnic groups to understand potential mechanism(s) responsible for this racial\/ethnic disparity.\nTODAY participants underwent periodic oral glucose tolerance tests to determine insulin sensitivity, C-peptide index, and oral disposition index (oDI), with measurements of total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMWA).\nAt baseline NHBs had significantly lower HMWA than NHWs and Hs, and exhibited a significantly smaller increase (17.3% vs. 33.7% vs. 29.9%, respectively) during the first 6 months overall. Increases in HMWA were associated with reductions in glycemic failure in the three racial\/ethnic groups combined (hazard ratio 0.61, P < 0.0001) and in each race\/ethnicity separately. Over time, HMWA was significantly lower in those who failed versus did not fail treatment, irrespective of race\/ethnicity. There were no differences in treatment-associated temporal changes in insulin sensitivity, C-peptide index, and oDI among the three racial\/ethnic groups.\nHMWA is a reliable biomarker of treatment response in youth with type 2 diabetes. The diminutive treatment-associated increase in HMWA in NHBs (\u223c50% lower) compared with NHWs and Hs may explain the observed racial\/ethnic disparity with higher therapeutic failure rates in NHBs in TODAY.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f8","authors":["Silva Arslanian","Laure El ghormli","Fida Bacha","Sonia Caprio","Robin Goland","Morey W.
