After screening different plant extracts with potential anti-influenza activity, a water extract of Taxodium distichum stems (TDSWex) showed excellent activity against influenza viruses. The EC50 of TDSWex was 0.051\u2009\u00b1\u20090.024\u2009mg\/mL against influenza virus A\/WSN\/33. TDSWex had excellent antiviral efficacy against various strains of human influenza A and B viruses, particularly oseltamivir-resistant clinical isolates and a swine-origin influenza strain. We observed that the synthesis of viral RNA and protein were inhibited in the presence of TDSWex. The results of the time-of-addition assay suggested that TDSWex inhibited viral entry and budding. In the hemagglutination inhibition assay, TDSWex inhibited the hemagglutination of red blood cells, implying that the extract targeted hemagglutin-related functions such as viral entry. In the attachment and penetration assay, TDSWex showed antiviral activity with EC50s of 0.045\u2009\u00b1\u20090.026 and 0.012\u2009\u00b1\u20090.003\u2009mg\/mL, respectively. In addition, TDSWex blocked neuraminidase activity. We conclude that TDSWex has bimodal activities against both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase during viral replication.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Chung-Fan Hsieh","Yu-Li Chen","Chwan-Fwu Lin","Jin-Yuan Ho","Chun-Hsun Huang","Cheng-Hsun Chiu","Pei-Wen Hsieh","Jim-Tong Horng"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep36015","first_seen_on":"2016-11-03T17:01:45+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1478193417,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep36015"],"pmid":"27796330","pubdate":"2016-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacoeconomics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Phenotypic screening","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"36015","subjects":["science"],"title":"An extract from Taxodium distichum targets hemagglutinin- and neuraminidase-related activities of influenza virus in vitro","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/extract-taxodium-distichum-targets-hemagglutinin-neuraminidaserelated-activities-influenza-virus-vit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639268,"mean":6.5692022176954,"rank":3497879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":3969022,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639268,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233589,"mean":12.792506361628,"rank":109698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":117564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233589,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29801,"mean":14.881085973154,"rank":14871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":13877,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29801,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2975,"mean":15.933587760592,"rank":1595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2975,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
