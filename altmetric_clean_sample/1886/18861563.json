Of the remaining 13 prostheses, there were radiographic signs of loosening in 8 cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5173cf058f610003804","authors":["Ljung, P","Lidgren, L","Rydholm, U"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-15T20:02:38+00:00","issns":["0001-6470"],"issue":"3","journal":"Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1470825718,"links":["http:\/\/ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2750493"],"pmid":"2750493","pubdate":"1989-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"Failure of the Wadsworth elbow.
