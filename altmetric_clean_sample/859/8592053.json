Jicama extract showed prominent inhibitory effects against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase. The IC50 values of jicama extract against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase were 0.083\u00b10.004 and 0.091\u00b10.017 mg\/mL, respectively. The increase in postprandial blood glucose levels was more significantly suppressed in the jicama extract-administered group than in the control group of both STZ-induced diabetic and normal mice. Blood glucose levels of the control group increased to 383.75\u00b111.54 and 402.50\u00b115.32 mg\/dL at 30 and 60 min after a meal and decreased to 349.67\u00b111.62 mg\/dL at 120 min. However, postprandial blood glucose levels were significantly decreased, when diabetic mice were fed with jicama extract (342.00\u00b115.73, 367.00\u00b113.00, and 329.67\u00b112.43 mg\/dL at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively). Furthermore, the area under the curve was significantly decreased with jicama extract administration in diabetic mice (P<0.05). Therefore, these results indicate that jicama extract may help decrease postprandial blood glucose level by inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidase.","authors":["Park, Chan Joo","Han, Ji-Sook"],"doi":"10.3746\/pnf.2015.20.2.88","endpage":"93","first_seen_on":"2016-06-08T18:27:19+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2287-1098"],"issue":"2","journal":"Preventive nutrition and food science","last_mentioned_on":1355583900,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26175995"],"pmid":"26175995","pubdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"88","title":"Hypoglycemic Effect of Jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus) Extract on Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Mice","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hypoglycemic-effect-jicama-pachyrhizus-erosus-extract-streptozotocininduced-diabetic-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
