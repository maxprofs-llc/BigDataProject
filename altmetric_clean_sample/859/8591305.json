This study aims to explore the associations of perceived social support (PSS) and general self-efficacy with OHRQoL and the mediating role of general self-efficacy in PSS-OHRQoL association after initial periodontal therapy.\nA prospective case series study was conducted among consecutive outpatients with chronic periodontitis during the period of July 2014-April 2015. A total of 145 eligible patients responded to OHRQoL questionnaire and periodontal examination at baseline. About 4 to 5\u00a0weeks after initial periodontal therapy, 120 patients completed the second OHRQoL measurement and periodontal examination, along with PSS and general self-efficacy measurement. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to determine the difference between baseline and post-treatment OHRQoL scores and periodontal parameters. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to explore the associations of PSS and general self-efficacy with post-treatment OHRQoL after adjusting for some demographic and periodontal variables. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were performed to explore the mediating role of general self-efficacy.\nInitial periodontal therapy resulted in a significant improvement in the mean total score and all domains of OHRQoL and all periodontal parameters measured. In hierarchical linear regression analysis, clinical attachment loss (CAL) was significantly and positively associated with post-treatment OHRQoL score (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.265, p\u2009<\u20090.01), while PSS (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.303, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and general self-efficacy (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.221, p\u2009<\u20090.01) were significantly and negatively associated with post-treatment OHRQL score, respectively. A significant mediating role of general self-efficacy (a*b\u2009=\u2009-0.139, BCa 95\u00a0% CI: -0.298, -0.011) in the association between PSS and post-treatment OHRQoL was revealed, and the proportion of the mediating role of general self-efficacy was 31.4\u00a0%.\nInitial periodontal therapy could significantly improve all aspects of OHRQoL. PSS and general self-efficacy could be the positive resources for improving OHRQoL after initial periodontal therapy among patients with periodontitis. General self-efficacy partly mediated the association between PSS and post-treatment OHRQoL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d0","authors":["Lei Miao","Lei Miao","Jingwen Feng","Liuzhong Wu","Shuwei Zhang","Ziming Ge","Yaping Pan"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12903-016-0227-7","first_seen_on":"2016-06-08T17:36:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1472-6831"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Oral Health","last_mentioned_on":1465407357,"links":["http:\/\/bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12903-016-0227-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12903-016-0227-7?site=http:\/\/bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4897808","pmid":"27268419","pubdate":"2016-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"The mediating role of general self-efficacy in the association between perceived social support and oral health-related quality of life after initial periodontal therapy","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mediating-role-general-selfefficacy-association-between-perceived-social-support-oral-healthrelated-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7871308,"mean":6.6666994406334,"rank":5969621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1054951,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7871308,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268735,"mean":11.392308312308,"rank":187881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44773,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268735,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"mean":3.7988114035088,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":457,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.3366666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bj_gibson\/statuses\/740598250345009152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8591305],"posted_on":"2016-06-08T17:35:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Barry Gibson","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2866640255\/7bd78daff4df877643de212928b16948_normal.png","description":"Professor in Medical Sociology at the University of Sheffield, exploring grounded theory, the mouth and systems theory.
