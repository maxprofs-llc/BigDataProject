In total, 2,576 type 2 diabetic participants, aged 40 and older, were evaluated. Seven standard retinal fundus photographs were obtained after pupil dilation in both eyes. DR was graded using the modified Airlie House classification system. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) included proliferative diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. MetS was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement, proposed in 2009, by the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association\/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between MetS and its individual components with DR and VTDR.\nAfter controlling for confounders, MetS was not associated with DR in men or women. Moreover, the risk for DR or VTDR did not increase with increasing MetS components. However, high waist circumference was significantly inversely associated with VTDR (adjusted odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.93) only in men.\nMetS was not associated with DR or VTDR in a Korean diabetic population. However, among MetS components, it seems that abdominal obesity was inversely associated with VTDR in Korean diabetic men.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Tai Kyong Kim","Jae Yon Won","Jeong Ah Shin","Yong-Moon Park","Hyeon Woo Yim","Young-Hoon Park"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0157006","first_seen_on":"2016-06-08T17:53:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1470916961,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0157006"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/asset?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0157006.PDF","pmcid":"PMC4898740","pmid":"27275953","pubdate":"2016-06-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0157006","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"The Association of Metabolic Syndrome with Diabetic Retinopathy: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008\u20132012","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/association-metabolic-syndrome-diabetic-retinopathy-korean-national-health-nutrition-examination-sur"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8200733,"mean":6.9347145888862,"rank":5935397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1973787,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8200733,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":271304,"mean":11.541981481959,"rank":172176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":83242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":271304,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113840,"mean":10.569439752633,"rank":77530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":30612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113840,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4630,"mean":13.070955281918,"rank":3336,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":1017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4630,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Sports and Recreations":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"MX":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aprendedorweb\/statuses\/740602504900190209","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8591622],"posted_on":"2016-06-08T17:52:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Alex","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/877344770355494917\/nOWNu028_normal.jpg","description":"Aprende de todo, Aprende de todos.","id_on_source":"aprendedorweb","tweeter_id":"2806836826","geo":{"lt":32.65002,"ln":-115.46107,"country":"MX"},"followers":1277},"tweet_id":"740602504900190209"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/USCArnoldSchool\/statuses\/763707207821164544","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8591622],"posted_on":"2016-08-11T12:02:41+00:00","author":{"name":"UofSC Arnold School","url":"http:\/\/www.sc.edu\/study\/colleges_schools\/public_health\/index.php","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/885578072078024704\/mbJEOT9H_normal.jpg","description":"The Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina","id_on_source":"USCArnoldSchool","tweeter_id":"1517311488","geo":{"lt":34.00071,"ln":-81.03481,"country":"US"},"followers":1114},"tweet_id":"763707207821164544"}]}}
