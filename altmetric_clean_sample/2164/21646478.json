In these patients, the combination of obinutuzumab-chlorambucil may be an appropriate therapeutic choice. Obinutuzumab-chlorambucil has been demonstrated to improve overall survival rates compared to chlorambucil alone and to improve progression-free survival and overall response rates compared to rituximab-chlorambucil. This combination can lead to certain toxicities that need to be addressed through appropriate patient selection, pre-medication and management. In this paper, we discuss evidence-based and author-recommended practical management of first-line CLL patients receiving obinutuzumab-chlorambucil.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002afe","authors":["Tam, Constantine","Kuss, Bryone","Opat, Stephen","Boulos, Joy","Marlton, Paula"],"doi":"10.1111\/imj.13493","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T10:34:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1445-5994"],"journal":"Internal Medicine Journal","last_mentioned_on":1499510050,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28685928?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28685928","pubdate":"2017-07-08T22:02:50+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Management of patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil.","type":"article","volume":"47 Suppl 4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/management-patients-previously-untreated-chronic-lymphocytic-leukaemia-obinutuzumab-chlorambucil-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":7077070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176220,"mean":11.44324974038,"rank":142817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176220,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":4.9041976744186,"rank":781,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.1677419354839,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
