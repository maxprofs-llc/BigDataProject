Mice underwent rectus muscle crush injury combined with ischemia created by epigastric vessel ligation, followed by A. baumannii inoculation. Reiterative experiments were performed using 1) a mutant deficient in the production of the siderophore acinetobactin, or 2) iron supplementation of the wound milieu. Mice were euthanized 7 days later and rectus muscle analyzed for signs of clinical infection, HIF1\u03b1 accumulation, bacterial abundance and colony morphotype. To determine the effect of wound milieu on bacterial virulence, the Galleria mellonella infection model was utilized.\nThe combination of rectus muscle injury with ischemia and A. baumannii inoculation resulted in 100% incidence of clinical wound infection that was significantly higher compared to other groups (n=15\/group, p<0.0001). The highest level of wound infection was accompanied with the highest level of A. baumannii colonization (p<0.0001) and the highest degree of HIF1\u03b1 accumulation (p<0.05). A. baumannii strains isolated from injured\/ischemic muscle with clinical infection displayed a rough morphotype and a higher degree of virulence as judged by G. mellonella killing assay as compared to smooth morphotype colonies isolated from injured muscle without clinical infection (100% vs. 60%, n=30 Log-Rank test, p=0.0422). Iron supplementation prevented wound infection (n=30, p<0.0001) and decreased HIF1\u03b1 (p=0.039643). Similar results of decrease in wound infection and HIF1\u03b1 were obtained when A. baumannii wild type was replaced with its derivative mutant [INCREMENT]BasD deficient in acinetobactin production.\nThe ability of A. baumannii to cause infections in traumatized wound relies on its ability to scavenge iron and can be prevented by iron supplementation to the wound milieu.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb22a83ee005f8b4573","authors":["Irma D.
