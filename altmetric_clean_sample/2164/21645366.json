Xist has Xist-specific repeat elements A-F which are conserved among eutherian mammals, underscoring their functional importance. Here we report that Xist RNA repeat E, a conserved Xist repeat element in the Xist exon 7, interacts with ASH2L and contributes to maintenance of escape gene expression level on the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) during XCI. The Xist repeat E-deletion mutant female ES cells show the depletion of ASH2L from the Xi upon differentiation. Furthermore, a subset of escape genes exhibits unexpectedly higher expression in the repeat E mutant cells than the cells expressing wildtype Xist during X-inactivation, whereas the silencing of X-linked non-escape genes is not affected. We discuss the implications of these results to understand the role of ASH2L and Xist repeat E for histone modifications and escape gene regulation during random X-chromosome inactivation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334a","authors":["Yue, Minghui","Ogawa, Akiyo","Yamada, Norishige","Charles Richard, John Lalith","Barski, Artem","Ogawa, Yuya"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pgen.1006890","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T10:06:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1553-7404"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1501759865,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28686623?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28686623","pubdate":"2017-07-08T22:01:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Xist RNA repeat E is essential for ASH2L recruitment to the inactive X and regulates histone modifications and escape gene expression.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/xist-rna-repeat-e-essential-ash2l-recruitment-inactive-x-regulates-histone-modifications-escape-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":4123920,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4129707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223803,"mean":12.097573247781,"rank":110325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":111147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223803,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5403,"mean":12.698620140689,"rank":3821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":1558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5403,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":16.455230769231,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
