Asthmatic and healthy subjects, aged 6 to 18\u00a0years old, recruited from two public schools in Southern Brazil were included in the study. Asthmatic subjects were selected using the criteria presented by the International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Children and control subjects based on the absence of respiratory symptoms. Anthropometric data was measured, body mass index calculated and subjects classified as normal weight, overweight or obese. Physical activity levels, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and inspiratory muscle endurance (IME) were also evaluated.\nA total of 314 participants were included, separated in control group (181) and asthmatics (133), with a total mean age of 11\u00a0years. When both groups were compared, there were no significant differences in both MIP and IME. However, when groups were analyzed subdivided in children and adolescents, IME was significantly reduced (p = 0.003) in asthmatic adolescents. Indeed, when groups were also stratified considering the nutritional status, IME showed a reduction in asthmatic adolescents with overweight (p = 0.042) and obesity (p = 0.041) when compared to healthy controls. No effects of physical activity levels between groups were found.\nResults demonstrate a reduction in the IME in asthmatic adolescents with overweight and obesity, indicating an association between asthma, nutritional status and respiratory muscle function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f71","authors":["Jo\u00e3o Paulo Heinzmann-Filho","Fernanda Maria Vendrusculo","Cristhiele Ta\u00eds Woszezenki","Taila Cristina Piva","Andressa Nunes Santos","Andressa Bombardi Barcellos","Bruna Brufatto Vagliatti","D\u00e9bora Gonzales Corr\u00eaa","Rita Mattiello","M\u00e1rcio Vin\u00edcius Fagundes Donadio"],"doi":"10.3109\/02770903.2016.1165698","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T10:11:23+00:00","issns":["0277-0903","1532-4303"],"journal":"Journal of Asthma","last_mentioned_on":1499508667,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27057823?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27057823","pubdate":"2016-10-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Inspiratory muscle function in asthmatic and healthy subjects: influence of age, nutrition and physical activity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inspiratory-muscle-function-asthmatic-healthy-subjects-influence-age-nutrition-physical-activity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177940,"mean":6.9186814093318,"rank":7077070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177940,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176221,"mean":11.443189059131,"rank":142817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176221,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1128,"mean":3.5170878438332,"rank":988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1128,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":3.625,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
