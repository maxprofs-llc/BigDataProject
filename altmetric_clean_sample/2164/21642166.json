This strategy requires 5 days or more of intravenous heparin while oral vitamin K antagonists gradually achieve a therapeutic effect. Oral vitamin K antagonists require frequent blood testing to optimize dosing, and their interactions with other medications and foods make regulation difficult. Therefore we tested a different approach to therapy: long-term enoxaparin monotherapy. We randomized 60 symptomatic pulmonary embolism patients in a 2:1 ratio to 90 days of enoxaparin as monotherapy without warfarin (N=40) or to intravenous unfractionated heparin as a \"bridge\" to warfarin, target INR 2.0-3.0 (N=20). Enoxaparin patients received 1 mg\/kg twice daily for 14 days during the acute phase followed by randomized assignment during the chronic phase to 1.0 mg\/kg vs. 1.5 mg\/kg once daily. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 3 of the 40 enoxaparin patients developed recurrent venous thromboembolism compared with 0 of 20 standard therapy patients (p = 0.54). One of the 40 enoxaparin patients had a major hemorrhagic complication compared with 2 of the 20 standard therapy patients (p = 0.26). Median hospital length of stay was shorter with enoxaparin compared to standard therapy (4 vs. 6 days) (p = 0.001). Following our study we can conclude that extended 3-month treatment with enoxaparin as monotherapy for symptomatic, acute pulmonary embolism is feasible and warrants further study in a large clinical trial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b6f","authors":["Beckman, Joshua A","Dunn, Kelly","Sasahara, Arthur A","Goldhaber, Samuel Z"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T08:13:36+00:00","issns":["0340-6245"],"issue":"6","journal":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","last_mentioned_on":1410897600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12783106"],"pmid":"12783106","pubdate":"2003-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Enoxaparin monotherapy without oral anticoagulation to treat acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism.","type":"article","volume":"89","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enoxaparin-monotherapy-without-oral-anticoagulation-treat-acute-symptomatic-pulmonary-embolism"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.136,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.136},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8023161,"mean":6.7922336161769,"rank":1485742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6534292,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8023161,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104742,"mean":10.762837150686,"rank":23902,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":80840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104742,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":861,"mean":3.334076744186,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":861,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
