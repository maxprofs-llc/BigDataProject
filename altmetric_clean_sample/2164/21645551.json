Many experts and professional societies have expressed concern about potential disruptions to care when youth living with HIV transition from pediatric to adult-oriented medical care. However, original research focused on this transition process is rare. The existing literature can be organized into the following categories: pre-transition assessments of anticipated barriers and concerns; studies describing provider practices during the transition period; and post-transition retrospective analyses after transition to adult care. Most studies had small sample sizes and focused on vertically infected youth. Further work is needed to document clinical outcomes after transition and to evaluate transition protocols that are in place at some institutions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e5","authors":["Sophia A Hussen","Ann Chahroudi","Ashley Boylan","Andres F Camacho-Gonzalez","Stephanie Hackett","Rana Chakraborty"],"doi":"10.2217\/fvl.14.73","first_seen_on":"2017-07-08T10:10:11+00:00","issns":["1746-0794","1746-0808"],"issue":"10","journal":"Future Virology","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2217\/fvl.14.73"],"pmid":"25983853","pubdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Future Medicine Ltd London, UK ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Transition of youth living with HIV from pediatric to adult-oriented healthcare: a review of the literature","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transition-youth-living-hiv-pediatric-adultoriented-healthcare-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8082038,"mean":6.8946982576228,"rank":2035356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4956797,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8082038,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146212,"mean":11.177179377749,"rank":46079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":98671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146212,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":4.3542314049587,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
