Chemokine ligand 12 and chemokine ligand 7 have been identified and investigated in multiple studies for their role in cellular trafficking in the setting of tissue regeneration. Recent early phase clinical trials have suggested that these molecules may lead to clinical benefit in patients with chronic disease. Importantly, these two proteins may play additional significant roles in directing the migration of multipotent cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. This article reviews the functions of these two chemokines, focusing on recruitment to sites of injury, immune function modulation, and contributions to embryonic development. Additional research would provide valuable insight into the potential clinical application of these two proteins in stem cell therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c4","authors":["Cheng JW","Sadeghi Z","Levine AD","Penn MS","von Recum HA","Caplan AI","Hijaz A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cyto.2014.06.007","first_seen_on":"2014-08-09T09:30:54+00:00","issns":["10434666"],"journal":"Cytokine","last_mentioned_on":1442110685,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1043466614001677?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25034237?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25034237","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"The role of CXCL12 and CCL7 chemokines in immune regulation, embryonic development, and tissue regeneration.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-cxcl12-ccl7-chemokines-immune-regulation-embryonic-development-tissue-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6330743,"mean":5.8300777567618,"rank":4441535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1655414,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6330743,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137714,"mean":8.5075927327124,"rank":86604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":45285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137714,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":747,"mean":1.5570750670241,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":747,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.08,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
