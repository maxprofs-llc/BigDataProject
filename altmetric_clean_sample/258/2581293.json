An in-depth analysis of gene conversion operating in the breakpoint-flanking regions of large NF1 deletions was performed to investigate whether the rate of discontinuous gene conversion during NAHR with crossover is increased, as has been previously noted in NAHR-mediated rearrangements. All 20 germline type-1 NF1 deletions analyzed were mediated by NAHR associated with continuous gene conversion within the breakpoint-flanking regions. Continuous gene conversion was also observed in 31\/32 type-2 NF1 deletions investigated. In contrast to the meiotic type-1 NF1 deletions, type-2 NF1 deletions are predominantly of post-zygotic origin. Our findings therefore imply that the mitotic as well as the meiotic NAHR intermediates of large NF1 deletions are processed by long-patch mismatch repair (MMR), thereby ensuring gene conversion tract continuity instead of the discontinuous gene conversion that is characteristic of short-patch repair. However, the single type-2 NF1 deletion not exhibiting continuous gene conversion was processed without MMR, yielding two different deletion-bearing chromosomes, which were distinguishable in terms of their breakpoint positions. Our findings indicate that MMR failure during NAHR, followed by post-meiotic\/mitotic segregation, has the potential to give rise to somatic mosaicism in human genomic rearrangements by generating breakpoint heterogeneity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767d","authors":["Bengesser K","Vogt J","Mussotter T","Mautner VF","Messiaen L","Cooper DN","Kehrer-Sawatzki H"],"doi":"10.1002\/humu.22473","first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T10:02:13+00:00","issns":["1059-7794"],"issue":"","journal":"Human Mutation","last_mentioned_on":1407492126,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24186807?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24186807","pubdate":"2013-11-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Analysis of Crossover Breakpoints Yields New Insights into the Nature of the Gene Conversion Events Associated with Large NF1 Deletions Mediated by Nonallelic Homologous Recombination.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-crossover-breakpoints-yields-new-insights-nature-gene-conversion-events-associated-large-nf"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4743694,"mean":5.7029253313863,"rank":2521424,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1576522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4743694,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116524,"mean":8.4768609115798,"rank":59395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":42616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116524,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1178,"mean":2.9200696686491,"rank":787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1178,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.3473684210526,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
