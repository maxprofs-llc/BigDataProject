The mean age at the time of surgery was 51.6 +\/- 8.9 years. According to the follow-up results evaluated with the Hospital for Special Surgery knee scoring system, 28 knees (77.7%) were classified as good or excellent. The mean flexion angle at follow-up evaluation was 99 degrees +\/- 24 degrees (10 degrees -140 degrees ). At the tibial or femoral bone-cement interfaces, a radiolucent line was seen in 10 of 36 knees (27.8%) at follow-up evaluation. The survival rate of prostheses with revision as the endpoint was estimated to be 93.7% at 15 years. Kinematic total knee arthroplasty in rheumatoid arthritis patients provided a good long-term outcome.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6203cf058f610007b79","authors":["Ito J","Koshino T","Okamoto R","Saito T"],"first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T04:18:24+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"The Journal of Arthroplasty","last_mentioned_on":1407418650,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14658102"],"pmid":"14658102","pubdate":"2003-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics"],"title":"15-year follow-up study of total knee arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/15year-followup-study-total-knee-arthroplasty-patients-rheumatoid-arthritis-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4115913,"mean":5.1087243297393,"rank":460206,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":3646016,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4115913,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102779,"mean":8.1451867909475,"rank":14702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":87893,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102779,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":541,"mean":1.8291666666667,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":541,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.0117647058824,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
