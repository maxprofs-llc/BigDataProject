However, it remains unclear how microbial sensing initiates chromatin remodeling. Here, we show that Akirin2, an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein, bridges NF-\u03baB and the chromatin remodeling SWI\/SNF complex by interacting with BRG1-Associated Factor 60 (BAF60) proteins as well as I\u03baB-\u03b6, which forms a complex with the NF-\u03baB p50 subunit. These interactions are essential for Toll-like receptor-, RIG-I-, and Listeria-mediated expression of proinflammatory genes including Il6 and Il12b in macrophages. Consistently, effective clearance of Listeria infection required Akirin2. Furthermore, Akirin2 and I\u03baB-\u03b6 recruitment to the Il6 promoter depend upon the presence of I\u03baB-\u03b6 and Akirin2, respectively, for regulation of chromatin remodeling. BAF60 proteins were also essential for the induction of Il6 in response to LPS stimulation. Collectively, the I\u03baB-\u03b6-Akirin2-BAF60 complex physically links the NF-\u03baB and SWI\/SNF complexes in innate immune cell activation. By recruiting SWI\/SNF chromatin remodellers to I\u03baB-\u03b6, transcriptional coactivator for NF-\u03baB, the conserved nuclear protein Akirin2 stimulates pro-inflammatory gene promoters in mouse macrophages during innate immune responses to viral or bacterial infection.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Sarang Tartey","Kazufumi Matsushita","Alexis Vandenbon","Daisuke Ori","Tomoko Imamura","Takashi Mino","Daron M Standley","Jules A Hoffmann","Jean-Marc Reichhart","Shizuo Akira","Osamu Takeuchi"],"doi":"10.15252\/embj.201488447","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T13:35:11+00:00","issns":["1460-2075"],"journal":"EMBO Journal","last_mentioned_on":1413528076,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25107474?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/content\/early\/2014\/08\/08\/embj.201488447","http:\/\/emboj.embopress.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/33\/20\/2332?rss=1"],"pmid":"25107474","pubdate":"2014-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Akirin2 is critical for inducing inflammatory genes by bridging I\u03baB\u2010\u03b6 and the SWI\/SNF complex","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/akirin2-critical-inducing-inflammatory-genes-bridging-i-b-swisnf-complex"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":320868,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4186174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110933,"mean":8.0592054051132,"rank":11216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":99684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110933,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4282,"mean":3.4118378883438,"rank":167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":4114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4282,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":8.4975555555556,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":73}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
