The wet-assembly of BHBF was regulated by the difference in surface energy and Laplace pressure. Especially, BHBF is characteristic of a hydrophilic rough bead for excellent water collection ability.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Lin Zhao","Cheng Song","Miaoxin Zhang","Yongmei Zheng"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4cc05156d","first_seen_on":"2014-08-07T22:23:52+00:00","issns":["1364-548X","1359-7345"],"issue":"73","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1407369600,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1039\/c4cc05156d","http:\/\/xlink.rsc.org\/?doi=10.1039\/c4cc05156d"],"pmid":"25078129","pubdate":"2014-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Bioinspired heterostructured bead-on-string fibers via controlling the wet-assembly of nanoparticles","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioinspired-heterostructured-beadonstring-fibers-via-controlling-wetassembly-nanoparticles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113006,"mean":5.1054066695351,"rank":512694,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":3577301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113006,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":102643,"mean":8.1286432064847,"rank":15978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":85815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":102643,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3431,"mean":2.787212244898,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":3057,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3431,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":3.0408045977011,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
