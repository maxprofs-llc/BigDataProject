It is unknown whether renal tight junction (TJ) proteins expression and localization are modified in CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Objective: To study if the expression of the TJ proteins occludin, claudin-2, claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) is modified in rats with CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats (n\u2009=\u20095\/group) were injected with saline solution (V group), and the other group (CP group) was injected with a single dose of saline solution and CP (7.5\u2009mg\/kg i.p.). Rats were sacrificed 72\u2009h after CP injection and blood, and 24-h urine samples were collected. Several plasma and urinary injury biomarkers as well as renal histopathology lesions, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers were evaluated, and protein levels of ocludin, claudin-2, claudin-5, ZO-1 were measured by Western blot. Statistically significant changes noted with different p\u2009<\u20090.05 versus V. Results: Nephrotoxicity was evident by histological alterations, glycosuria, decrease in creatinine clearance, increase in fractional excretion of sodium, serum creatinine and kidney injury molecule-1. These changes were associated with oxidative\/nitrosative stress (increased renal abundance of 3-nitrotyrosine and protein kinase C\u03b22 and decreased renal expression of nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2) and decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Finally, it was found that CP-induced renal damage was associated with decreased renal expression of occludin and claudin-2. Discussion and conclusion: CP altered the TJ proteins expression and localization in the proximal tubule that was associated with oxidative\/nitrosative stress.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f610004676","authors":["Joyce Trujillo"],"doi":"10.3109\/15376516.2014.948248","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T03:31:54+00:00","issns":["1537-6516"],"journal":"Toxicology Methods","last_mentioned_on":1411134984,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/15376516.2014.948248"],"pmid":"25052570","pubdate":"2014-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Renal tight junction proteins are decreased in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/renal-tight-junction-proteins-decreased-cisplatininduced-nephrotoxicity-rats-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2898080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1453679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110933,"mean":8.0595822125268,"rank":69034,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":38050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110933,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239,"mean":1.2330420168067,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":1.0766666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"ID":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_Toxicology\/status\/499035434295390208","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2588074],"posted_on":"2014-08-12T03:31:33+00:00","author":{"name":"T&F Toxicology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/668779195099709440\/n6CZC9_R_normal.png","description":"Keep up to date with all the latest news and content from Taylor & Francis Toxicology journals.","id_on_source":"IHC_Toxicology","tweeter_id":"26992934","geo":{"lt":51.50853,"ln":-0.12574,"country":"GB"},"followers":2528},"tweet_id":"499035434295390208"}],"facebook":[{"title":"Renal tight junction proteins are decreased in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats,...","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1791370383\/posts\/263092930481097","license":"public","citation_ids":[2588074],"posted_on":"2014-09-19T13:56:24+00:00","summary":"Can anyone help me with these papers? http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/15376516.2014.948248\n\ne-mail: pedrorojasm@outlook.com :)","author":{"name":"Pedro Rojas M","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1791370383","facebook_wall_name":false,"image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/1791370383\/picture","id_on_source":"1791370383"}}]}}
