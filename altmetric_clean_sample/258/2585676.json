A recently completed pilot randomized controlled trial of telephone-administered motivational interviewing (Tele-MI) targeting sexual risk behavior in 100 HIV-positive late middle-age and older adults found that a four-session Tele-MI intervention reduced episodes of non-condom-protected anal and vaginal intercourse. This secondary analysis examined the moderating effect of baseline depressive symptoms on intervention efficacy. When compared to one session of Tele-MI or standard of care, four sessions of Tele-MI produced greater reductions in sexual risk behavior in participants with subsyndromal depression at baseline but was no more efficacious than the other two conditions for participants with no or elevated baseline depressive symptoms. Large-scale studies that further elucidate the role of depression in sexual risk reduction interventions for HIV-positive persons are needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f610001698","authors":["Lovejoy TI","Heckman TG"],"doi":"10.1080\/08964289.2014.893982","first_seen_on":"2014-08-11T08:31:58+00:00","issns":["0896-4289"],"issue":"3","journal":"Behavioral Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1408912962,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25090365"],"pmid":"25090365","pubdate":"2014-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["behavioralsciences","psychiatry"],"title":"Depression Moderates Treatment Efficacy of an HIV Secondary-Prevention Intervention for HIV-Positive Late Middle-Age and Older Adults.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/depression-moderates-treatment-efficacy-hiv-secondaryprevention-intervention-hivpositive-late-middle"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":2317382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2591927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127191,"mean":8.4281164871454,"rank":53140,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":69830,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127191,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":3.9913,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":6.5166666666667,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
