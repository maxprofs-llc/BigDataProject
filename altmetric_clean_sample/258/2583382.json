The preoperative assessment included a physical examination, semen analysis, assessment of ASAs in seminal plasma, hormonal levels (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone and testosterone), and scrotal colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) to measure the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index. Patients were scheduled for varicocelectomy, with high ligation (Palomo) used in 40 patients (18, 45%, with left and 22, 55%, with bilateral varicocele), or an inguinal approach (Ivanissivich) with loupe magnification used in 42 (17, 40%, with left and 25, 60%, with bilateral varicocele). The men were reassessed at \u2a7e3\u00a0months after surgery and according to the improvement in seminal variables (expressed as a \u2a7e50% increase in total motile sperm count, TMSC), patients were further categorised into 'improved' or 'unimproved'. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the predictors of improvement.\nBefore surgery the ASAs were positive in 17 men (21%). There was no significant difference between the right and left sides in intratesticular haemodynamics. The TMSC was improved in 52 (63%) patients who had a significant improvement in the haemodynamic variables. Intratesticular haemodynamics, serum FSH and testosterone levels differed significantly between the improved and unimproved patients. Positivity for ASAs, the surgical approach and laterality of the varicocele were not significantly different, although the ASA-positive cases were characterised by a significant decrease in motility. Logistic regression analysis showed that the EDV, PSV, FSH, testosterone level and bilateral testicular volume (BTV) were significant predictors of improvement.\nPositivity for ASAs is not a predictor of the outcome after varicocelectomy but affects only the motile fraction in positive cases, despite the improvement in other seminal variables and testicular haemodynamics, and regardless of the surgical approach. The EDV, PSV, FSH, testosterone and BTV were significant predictors of a successful outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006ac1","authors":["Al-Adl, Ahmed M","El-Karamany, Tarek","Issa, Hesham","Zaazaa, Mohamed"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.aju.2014.07.001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-09T08:24:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2090598X","2090-598X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Arab Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1407572654,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2090598X14000667?_docanchor=&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_rdoc=1&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"26019968","pubdate":"2015-05-29T22:00:53+00:00","title":"The influence of antisperm antibodies, intratesticular haemodynamics and the surgical approach to varicocelectomy on seminal variables ","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-antisperm-antibodies-intratesticular-haemodynamics-surgical-approach-varicocelectomy-semin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4508612,"mean":5.1916753366762,"rank":3037797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":913079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4508612,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110544,"mean":8.2401792424669,"rank":72271,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24675,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110544,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.1076923076923,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ABA_tweets\/status\/498021925105717248","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2583382],"posted_on":"2014-08-09T08:24:14+00:00","author":{"name":"ABA","url":"http:\/\/www.aba.uk.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/895904353990696960\/I9h_D0g-_normal.jpg","description":"The Association of Biomedical Andrologists provides support for laboratory scientists in the United Kingdom who undertake Clinical Andrology in their daily work","id_on_source":"ABA_tweets","tweeter_id":"1699160017","geo":{"lt":54.75844,"ln":-2.69531,"country":"GB"},"followers":569},"tweet_id":"498021925105717248"}]}}
