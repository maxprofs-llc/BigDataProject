Not surprisingly, separation methods are useful to determine accurately the liquid-liquid distribution constants, commonly called partition coefficient. After briefly recalling the thermodynamics of the partitioning of solutes between two liquid phases, the review lists the different methods of measurement in which chromatography is involved. The shake-flask method is described. The ease of the HPLC method is pointed out with its drawback: the correlation is very sensitive to congeneric effect. Microemulsion electrokinetic capillary electrophoresis has become a fast and reliable method commonly used in industry. Counter-current chromatography (CCC) is a liquid chromatography method that uses a liquid stationary phase. Since the CCC solute retention volumes are only depending on their partition coefficients, it is the method of choice for partition coefficient determination with any liquid system. It is shown that Ko\/w, the octanol-water partition coefficients, are obtained by CCC within the -1 < log Ko\/w < 4 range, without any correlation or standardization using octanol as the stationary phase. Examples of applications of the knowledge of liquid-liquid partition coefficient in the vast world of solvent extraction and hydrophobicity estimation are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["A Berthod","S Carda-Broch","Berthod A","Carda-Broch S"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2004.01.001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-11T17:53:58+00:00","issns":["00219673"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1458378164,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967304000445","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.chroma.2004.01.001","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15214657"],"pmid":"15214657","pubdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Determination of liquid\u2013liquid partition coefficients by separation methods ","type":"article","volume":"1037","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/determination-liquidliquid-partition-coefficients-separation-methods"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7410208,"mean":6.44364379996,"rank":1709462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":5667952,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7410208,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178421,"mean":7.4830504651947,"rank":44458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":133142,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178421,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2825,"mean":2.2548271954674,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":2642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2825,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.0735294117647,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":24,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
