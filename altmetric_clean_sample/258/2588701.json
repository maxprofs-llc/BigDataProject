They derive from double-stranded intrinsic transcripts and are processed by Dicer and associate with Argonaute proteins. In Caenorhabditis elegans, endo-siRNAs are known as 22G and 26G RNAs and are involved in genome protection and gene regulation. Drosophila melanogaster endo-siRNAs are produced with the help of specific Dicer and Argonaute isoforms and play an essential role in transposon control and the protection from viral infections. Biological functions of endo-siRNAs in vertebrates include repression of transposable elements and chromatin organization, as well as gene regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c4","authors":["Monica J Piatek","Andreas Werner"],"doi":"10.1042\/bst20140068","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T10:10:43+00:00","issns":["1470-8752"],"issue":"4","journal":"Biochemical Society Transactions","last_mentioned_on":1407840768,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25110021?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25110021","pubdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Endogenous siRNAs: regulators of internal affairs.","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endogenous-sirnas-regulators-internal-affairs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2898097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1453665,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110933,"mean":8.0594077813437,"rank":69038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":38047,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110933,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":2.254186440678,"rank":527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":0.94106666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
