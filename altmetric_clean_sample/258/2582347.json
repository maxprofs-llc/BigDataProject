Herein, we developed a nanochannel-based electrochemical reactor and a kinetic model to investigate the immunological reaction in confined nanochannels simply by the electrochemical method. As a result, except for the reaction kinetic constant that was previously studied, more insightful kinetic information such as the moving speed of the antibody and the immunological reaction progress in nanochannels were successfully revealed in a quantitative way for the first time. This study would not only pave the investigation of molecular biological processes in confined nanospaces but also be promising to extend to other fields such as biological detection and clinical diagnosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Jiachao Yu"],"doi":"10.1021\/ac501135u","first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T16:16:52+00:00","issns":["0003-2700"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1407516533,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ac501135u"],"pmid":"25034149","pubdate":"2014-07-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Quantitative Evaluation of Biological Reaction Kinetics in Confined Nanospaces.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/quantitative-evaluation-biological-reaction-kinetics-confined-nanospaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":2898680,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1453212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":32},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110295,"mean":8.1029026238963,"rank":68907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":37620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110295,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5069,"mean":2.4216104972376,"rank":2505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":2348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5069,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":378,"mean":4.0172572944297,"rank":151,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":378,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
