However, wild populations of H. potanini declined sharply due to anthropological activity in the Jinsha River during the past decades. In present study, the complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequence of H. potanini was first determined by DNA sequencing based on the PCR fragments. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence is a circular molecule of 16,569\u2009bp in size. It consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a control region (D-loop). The gene nucleotide composition of H. potanini is 30.1% A, 26.9% C, 16.7% G, and 26.3% T, with a relatively high A\u2009+\u2009T content (56.4%). The results could provide useful data for studies on genetic structure and rational resource conservation in H. potanini.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f610004220","authors":["Yan-Fu Que"],"doi":"10.3109\/19401736.2014.945564","first_seen_on":"2014-08-09T03:35:31+00:00","issns":["1940-1736"],"journal":"Mitochondrial DNA: The Journal of DNA Mapping, Sequencing & Analysis","last_mentioned_on":1407555287,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.945564","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/19401736.2014.945564"],"pmid":"25103447","pubdate":"2014-08-07T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Characterization of the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Homatula potanini (Cypriniformes, Nemacheilidae, Nemachilinae).","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-complete-mitochondrial-genome-sequence-ihomatula-potaninii-cypriniformes-nemacheili"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4120620,"mean":5.1065865616768,"rank":3298187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":102256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4120620,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103090,"mean":8.1045056213564,"rank":82331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103090,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1116,"mean":0.66520717488789,"rank":353,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1116,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97,"mean":0.49114583333333,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IHC_CellBiology\/status\/497949081243623426","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2583158],"posted_on":"2014-08-09T03:34:47+00:00","author":{"name":"Cell Biology","url":"http:\/\/informahealthcare.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1253708030\/IHC-Twitter-profile-cell-biology2_normal.png","description":"Informa Healthcare's Cell Biology portfolio consists of 19 peer-reviewed journals designed to help you find the information you need for your research.","id_on_source":"IHC_CellBiology","tweeter_id":"140452905","geo":{"lt":"51.5072759","ln":"-0.1276597","country":"GB"},"followers":515},"tweet_id":"497949081243623426"}]}}
