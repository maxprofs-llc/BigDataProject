Despite child survival and safe motherhood programmes towards reducing child mortality, insufficient attention has been given to this critical first month of life. There is urgent need to innovatively employ alternative solutions that take into account the intricate complexities of neonatal health and the health systems. In this paper, we set out to empirically contribute to understanding the causes of the stagnating neonatal mortality by applying a systems thinking approach to explore the dynamics arising from the neonatal health complexity and non-linearity and its interplay with health systems factors, using Uganda as a case study.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000082c","authors":["Agnes Semwanga Rwashana","Sarah Nakubulwa","Margaret Nakakeeto-Kijjambu","Taghreed Adam"],"doi":"10.1186\/1478-4505-12-36","first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T04:39:50+00:00","issns":["1478-4505"],"issue":"1","journal":"Health Research Policy and Systems","last_mentioned_on":1414106334,"links":["http:\/\/www.health-policy-systems.com\/content\/12\/1\/36\/abstract","http:\/\/www.health-policy-systems.com\/content\/12\/1\/36","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4134459\/?tool=pubmed&utm_content=buffer21823&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4134459\/?tool=pubmed&utm_content=buffer6f5dc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4134459\/?tool=pubmed&utm_content=buffer2bb24&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1478-4505-12-36"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.health-policy-systems.com\/content\/pdf\/1478-4505-12-36.pdf","pmid":"25104047","pubdate":"2014-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Policy And Administration","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"36","subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"title":"Advancing the application of systems thinking in health: understanding the dynamics of neonatal mortality in Uganda","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advancing-application-systems-thinking-health-understanding-dynamics-neonatal-mortality-uganda"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8147970,"mean":6.8914734911172,"rank":557514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7589687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8147970,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181457,"mean":7.7632125033069,"rank":15239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":166193,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181457,"percentile":91},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":470,"mean":9.3090277185501,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":470,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":11.347833333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":17,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":16,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
