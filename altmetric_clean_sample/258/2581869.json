The establishment of these lineages is preceded by the inside-versus-outside positioning of cells in the early embryo and stochastic expression of key transcription factors, which is then resolved into lineage-restricted expression. The regulatory inputs that drive this restriction and how they relate to cell position are largely unknown. Here, we show an unsuspected role of Notch signaling in regulating trophectoderm-specific expression of Cdx2 in cooperation with TEAD4. Notch activity is restricted to outer cells and is able to influence positional allocation of blastomeres, mediating preferential localization to the trophectoderm. Our results show that multiple signaling inputs at preimplantation stages specify the first embryonic lineages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f0","authors":["Rayon T","Menchero S","Nieto A","Xenopoulos P","Crespo M","Cockburn K","Ca\u00f1on S","Sasaki H","Hadjantonakis AK","de la Pompa JL","Rossant J","Manzanares M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.devcel.2014.06.019","endpage":"422","first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T13:09:17+00:00","funders":["cihr","nci"],"issns":["1534-5807","15345807"],"issue":"4","journal":"Developmental Cell","last_mentioned_on":1416766741,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fdevelopmental-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1534-5807%252814%252900408-0&code=cell-site","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fdevelopmental-cell%2Fabstract%2FS1534-5807%252814%252900408-0&code=cell-site","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1534580714004080","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.devcel.2014.06.019","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25127056?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1534580714004080\/pdf","pmid":"25127056","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"410","subjects":["embryology","cellbiology"],"title":"Notch and Hippo Converge on Cdx2 to Specify the Trophectoderm Lineage in the Mouse Blastocyst.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/notch-hippo-converge-cdx2-specify-trophectoderm-lineage-mouse-blastocyst"},"altmetric_score":{"score":22.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":22.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6551568,"mean":6.0694288050471,"rank":271309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6280061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6551568,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":152046,"mean":8.1611592620608,"rank":9444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":142595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":152046,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1949,"mean":7.4033798767967,"rank":136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":1813,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1949,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":5.5013333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":39,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":13,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":5,"Members of the public":11}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":35,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
