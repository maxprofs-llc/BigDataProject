The relict niter-beds are now conserved in the underfloor space of gassho-style houses, where they are isolated from destabilizing environmental factors and retain the ability to produce nitrate. However, little is known about the nitrifying microbes in such relict niter-bed ecosystems. In this study, the microbial community structures within nine relict niter-bed soils were investigated using 454 pyrotag analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene and the bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase gene (amoA). The 16S rRNA gene pyrotag analysis showed that members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Planctomycetes were major microbial constituents, and principal coordinate analysis showed that the NO3-, Cl-, K+, and Na+ contents were potential determinants of the structures of entire microbial communities in relict niter-bed soils. The bacterial and archaeal amoA libraries indicated that members of the Nitrosospira-type ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and \"Ca. Nitrososphaera\"-type ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), respectively, predominated in relict niter-bed soils. In addition, soil pH and organic carbon content were important factors for the ecological niche of AOB and AOA in relict niter-bed soil ecosystems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Takashi Narihiro","Hideyuki Tamaki","Aya Akiba","Kazuto Takasaki","Koichiro Nakano","Yoichi Kamagata","Satoshi Hanada","Taizo Maji"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0104752","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T02:53:50+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1407882909,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0104752"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0104752.pdf","pmid":"25111392","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Microbial Community Structure of Relict Niter-Beds Previously Used for Saltpeter Production","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microbial-community-structure-relict-niterbeds-previously-used-saltpeter-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1635928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2858097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110938,"mean":8.144902440124,"rank":33407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":77012,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110938,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80038,"mean":8.426538700851,"rank":26268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":53388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80038,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1942,"mean":17.728114374034,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1140,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1942,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Environmental Science":2,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"ID":1},"mendeley":{"US":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PLOSONE\/status\/499260207776555009","license":"datasift","rt":["tnari"],"citation_ids":[2588008],"posted_on":"2014-08-12T18:24:44+00:00","author":{"name":"PLOS ONE","url":"http:\/\/plosone.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2429958559\/mzjl6as5u2m09r2erof6_normal.jpeg","description":"PLOS ONE is an international, peer-reviewed, open-access, online science publication.","id_on_source":"PLOSONE","tweeter_id":"27596259","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":87308},"tweet_id":"499260207776555009"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArthurKomberg\/status\/499323228775788544","license":"datasift","rt":["tnari"],"citation_ids":[2588008],"posted_on":"2014-08-12T22:35:09+00:00","author":{"name":"ArthurKomberg","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/478923038780428289\/G0KaKF89_normal.jpeg","description":"Show must go on","id_on_source":"ArthurKomberg","tweeter_id":"2573097218","geo":{"lt":"-3.09812865","ln":"135.598982170321","country":"ID"},"followers":2},"tweet_id":"499323228775788544"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tnari\/status\/499025883873935361","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2588008],"posted_on":"2014-08-12T02:53:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Takashi Narihiro","url":"http:\/\/www.microbes-and-environments.jp\/","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418956796653363200\/jmu2I2x7_normal.jpeg","description":"Researcher in the environmental microbiology \/ visiting scientist in the University of Illinois \/ managing editor of Microbes and Environments","id_on_source":"tnari","tweeter_id":"14968873","geo":{"lt":"39.7837304","ln":"-100.4458825","country":"US"},"followers":66},"tweet_id":"499025883873935361"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/claufresearch\/status\/499261640794460160","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2588008],"posted_on":"2014-08-12T18:30:25+00:00","author":{"name":"Dra.
