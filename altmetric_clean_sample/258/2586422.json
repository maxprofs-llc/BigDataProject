The combined administration of low-dose hepatitis B hyperimmune gamma globulin and a nucleoside\/nucleotide analogue with a high genetic barrier to resistance, such as entecavir (except for patients with lamivudine resistance) or tenofovir, represents the standard for the prophylaxis of recurrent hepatitis B infection and is used in most centers. The drawbacks of long-term administration of hyperimmune gamma globulin have led to research on regimens in which this agent is withdrawn after a certain amount of time in combination treatment, a strategy that appears to be safe in patients with undetectable viremia at the time of liver transplantation if the patients adhere to the treatment. In recent years, there has also been research into regimens of gamma-globulin-free prophylaxis, based only on the administration of oral antiviral drugs, which appear to be safe if antivirals with a high genetic barrier to resistance are used. Hepatitis B prophylaxis should be maintained indefinitely; therefore, the total withdrawal of prophylaxis is not an accepted strategy at present in daily clinical practice if not in the context of a clinical trial.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fa","authors":["Prieto M","Garc\u00eda-Eliz M"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0210-5705(14)70067-6","first_seen_on":"2014-08-11T14:50:28+00:00","issns":["0210-5705"],"issue":"","journal":"Gastroenterolog\u00eda y Hepatolog\u00eda (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1407768530,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25087710?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25087710","pubdate":"2014-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"[Strategies for avoiding hepatitis B infection recurrence following liver transplantation].","type":"article","volume":"37 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrategias-para-evitar-la-recidiva-viral-b-despu%C3%A9s-del-trasplante-hep%C3%A1tico"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":4199469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":127191,"mean":8.4281282805254,"rank":102501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":127191,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.3198103448276,"rank":83,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/emiliomonteb\/status\/498843489560690688","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2586422],"posted_on":"2014-08-11T14:48:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Emilio Monte","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/emilio-monte-boquet-67032624\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/898548741422153728\/en1Mia9R_normal.jpg","description":"#Farmacia #HospitalLaFe #HospitalPharmacy PharmD PhD #eSalud #eHealth #Sherpas20 @ufpelafe @eDruida_","id_on_source":"emiliomonteb","tweeter_id":"51391835","geo":{"lt":39.5,"ln":-0.75,"country":"ES"},"followers":3631},"tweet_id":"498843489560690688"}]}}
