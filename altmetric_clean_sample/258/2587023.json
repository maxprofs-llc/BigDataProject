However, this method still has many drawbacks, such as the use of alkaline aqueous medium, low poly(dopamine) deposition rate, and inefficient utilization of dopamine, which greatly hinder its practical application. In the present study, we demonstrate that electropolymerization of dopamine is a facile and versatile approach to surface tailoring of metallic cardiovascular stents, such as small and complex-shaped coronary stent. Electropolymerization of dopamine leads to the formation of a continuous and smooth electropolymerized poly(dopamine) (ePDA) coating on the substrate surface. This electrochemical method exhibits a higher deposition rate and is more efficient in dopamine utilization compared with the typical self-polymerization method. The ePDA coating facilitates the immobilization of biomolecules onto substrates to engineer biomimetic microenvironments. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments demonstrate that ePDA coating functionalized with vascular endothelial growth factor can greatly enhance the desired cellular responses of endothelial cells and prevent the neointima formation after stent implantation. The proposed methodology may find applications in the area of metallic surface engineering, especially for the cardiovascular stents and potentially all biomedical devices with electroconductive surface as well.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","doi":"10.1016\/j.biomaterials.2014.05.047","first_seen_on":"2014-08-11T20:26:58+00:00","issns":["01429612"],"journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1407788720,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0142961214006048"],"pmid":"24929615","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Electropolymerization of dopamine for surface modification of complex-shaped cardiovascular stents ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electropolymerization-dopamine-surface-modification-complexshaped-cardiovascular-stents"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4127946,"mean":5.1089039524084,"rank":2320139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1056181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4127946,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103422,"mean":8.097866758202,"rank":56328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":26831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103422,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1464,"mean":4.2154545454545,"rank":645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":470,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1464,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.7906274509804,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
