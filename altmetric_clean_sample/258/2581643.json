All but 5 HBsAg+ patients were treated with lamivudine or entecavir before chemotherapy until at least 6 months after chemotherapy or ASCT. HBV reactivation occurred in 6 HBsAg+ patients and 2 HBsAg- patients, including 6 who received an ASCT. OS and PFS of HBsAg- patients were significantly longer than HBsAg+ patients (both P values < 0.01). In view of these results, we confirmed that incidence of HBV reactivation was notable in MM patients receiving bortezomib-containing regimens, especially those underwent ASCT. HBsAg+ MM patients had poorer prognosis than HBsAg- patients. Prophylactic treatment should be prescribed to all HBsAg+ MM patients for a minimal duration of 12 months.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004181","authors":["Juan Li","Beihui Huang","Ying Li","Dong Zheng","Zhenhai Zhou","Junru Liu"],"doi":"10.3109\/10428194.2014.941833","first_seen_on":"2014-08-08T11:28:11+00:00","issns":["1029-2403"],"journal":"Leukemia & Lymphoma","last_mentioned_on":1407542607,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25098429"],"pmid":"25098429","pubdate":"2014-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["neoplasms","hematology"],"title":"Hepatitis B virus reactivation in multiple myeloma patients receiving bortezomib-containing regimens followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-patients-multiple-myeloma-receiving-bortezomibcontaining-regimens-fol-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036385,"mean":5.9659709716306,"rank":1975004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3029589,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036385,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126639,"mean":8.4776718994301,"rank":42243,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":83291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126639,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":831,"mean":1.616886746988,"rank":184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":831,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":1.0444444444444,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ManchurianDevil\/status\/497705806880866305","license":"datasift","rt":["Myeloma_Doc"],"citation_ids":[2581643],"posted_on":"2014-08-08T11:28:05+00:00","author":{"name":"James Stanhope","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3322402956\/160bd92477ce47a4db7da262e9b94cbf_normal.png","description":"Following news\/commentary about Middle East and U.S. Healthcare.
