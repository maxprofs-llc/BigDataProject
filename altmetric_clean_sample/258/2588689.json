The present study investigated the biomechanical and biological responses of chondrogenic progenitor ATDC5 cells cultured on the DN gel. ATDC5 cells were cultured on a polystyrene surface without insulin (Culture 1) and with insulin (Culture 2), and on the DN gel without insulin (Culture 3). The cultured cells were evaluated using micropipette aspiration for cell Young\u05f3s modulus and qPCR for gene expression of chondrogenic and actin organization markers on days 3, 7 and 14. On day 3, the cells in Culture 3 formed nodules, in which the cells exhibited an actin cortical layer inside them, and gene expression of type-II collagen, aggrecan, and SOX9 was significantly higher in Culture 3 than Cultures 1 and 2 (p<0.05). Young\u05f3s modulus in Culture 3 was significantly higher than that in Culture 1 throughout the testing period (p<0.05) and that in Culture 2 on day 14 (p<0.01). There was continuous expression of actin organization markers in Culture 3. This study highlights that the cells on the DN gel increased the modulus and mRNA expression of chondrogenic markers at an earlier time point with a greater magnitude compared to those on the polystyrene surface with insulin. This study also demonstrates a possible strong interrelation among alteration of cell mechanical properties, changes in actin organization and the induction of chondrogenic differentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002ccf","authors":["Eijiro Maeda","Takehiro Tsutsumi","Nobuto Kitamura","Takayuki Kurokawa","Jian Ping Gong","Kazunori Yasuda","Toshiro Ohashi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiomech.2014.07.021","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T10:09:50+00:00","issns":["1873-2380"],"journal":"Journal of Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1407838164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25110167?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25110167","pubdate":"2014-07-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Significant increase in Young\u05f3s modulus of ATDC5 cells during chondrogenic differentiation induced by PAMPS\/PDMAAm double-network gel: Comparison with induction by insulin.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/significant-increase-youngs-modulus-atdc5-cells-during-chondrogenic-differentiation-induced-pampspdm"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4131886,"mean":5.1087571255083,"rank":3306783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":103425,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4131886,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103604,"mean":8.112902657259,"rank":82776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103604,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":735,"mean":2.4236920980926,"rank":518,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":735,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.6833333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
