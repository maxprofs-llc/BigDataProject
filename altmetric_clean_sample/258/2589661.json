The National Institute of Mental Health, through their Research Domain Criteria initiative, has encouraged a dimensional approach to the study of psychopathology as opposed to an over-reliance on categorical (e.g. DSM-based) diagnostic approaches. Moreover, subthreshold levels of depressive symptoms (i.e. severity levels below DSM criteria) have been found to be associated with a range of negative outcomes, yet have been relatively neglected in neuroimaging research.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d9","doi":"10.1017\/s0033291714000348","first_seen_on":"2014-08-12T13:19:04+00:00","issns":["1469-8978"],"issue":"13","journal":"Psychological Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1407849496,"links":["http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?aid=9318592&fromPage=online"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/article_S0033291714000348","pmid":"25066703","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"2833","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Reduced gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus as a function of mild depressive symptoms: a voxel-based morphometric analysis","type":"article","volume":"44","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-gray-matter-volume-anterior-cingulate-orbitofrontal-cortex-thalamus-function-mild-depressive"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507652,"mean":5.1453542744813,"rank":3569388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507652,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110934,"mean":8.0592449857123,"rank":83903,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110934,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1829,"mean":6.0170645514223,"rank":1515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1829,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":15.780263157895,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
