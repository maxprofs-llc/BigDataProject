Sixty-five middle school struggling readers were randomly assigned to one of five groups and over a 12-week-period received one of the following interventions: (1) two phases of intervention with Fast ForWord (FFW, experimental group), (2) two phases of intervention with SuccessMaker (SM, active control group), (3) FFW followed by SM, (4) SM followed by FFW, or (5) no intervention beyond the regular class curriculum (developmental control group). Changes in reading, phonemic awareness, spelling and language skills were assessed via a repeated measures MANOVA. Results indicated significant within-subjects effects (i.e., change for all participants over time), but no between-subject group differences, failing to show that Fast ForWord resulted in any gains over and above those seen in the other groups.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002426","doi":"10.1016\/j.bandl.2007.12.001","first_seen_on":"2014-08-11T13:17:58+00:00","issns":["0093934X"],"journal":"Brain & Language","last_mentioned_on":1407763061,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0093934X07002957"],"pmid":"18657684","pubdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"A randomized, controlled study of computer-based intervention in middle school struggling readers ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/randomized-controlled-study-computerbased-intervention-middle-school-struggling-readers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4127946,"mean":5.1089039524084,"rank":2320139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1056181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4127946,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103422,"mean":8.097866758202,"rank":56328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":26831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103422,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":5.3065971563981,"rank":283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.866,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Ph.
