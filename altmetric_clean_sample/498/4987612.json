EOMBC was defined as breast cancer with five or less metastases involving any organs except the brain. All patients had bone metastasis (BM) and seven patients had pulmonary, hepatic, or lymph node metastasis. Median RT dose applied to metastatic lesions was 30 Gy (range, 20 to 60 Gy).\nThe 5-year tumor local control (LC) and 3-year distant progression-free survival (DPFS) rate were 66.1% and 36.8%, respectively. High RT dose (\u226550 Gy10) was significantly associated with improved LC. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49%. Positive hormone receptor status, pathologic nodal stage of primary cancer, solitary BM, and whole-lesion RT (WLRT), defined as RT whose field encompassed entire extent of disease, were associated with better survival. On analysis for subgroup of solitary BM, high RT dose was significantly associated with improved LC and DPFS, shorter metastasis-to-RT interval (\u22641 month) with improved DPFS, and WLRT with improved DPFS and OS, respectively.\nHigh-dose RT in solitary BM status and WLRT have the potential to improve the progression-free survival and OS of patients with EOMBC.","altmetric_jid":"57c97924aee83ee7978b457d","authors":["Yoo, Gyu Sang","Yu, Jeong Il","Park, Won","Huh, Seung Jae","Choi, Doo Ho"],"doi":"10.3857\/roj.2015.33.4.301","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T20:44:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2234-1900"],"issue":"4","journal":"Radiation Oncology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452683495,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26756030?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4707213","pmid":"26756030","pubdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Prognostic factors in breast cancer with extracranial oligometastases and the appropriate role of radiation therapy.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prognostic-factors-breast-cancer-extracranial-oligometastases-appropriate-role-radiation-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5194744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":989943,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145285652468,"rank":208869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":56079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":0.57272727272727,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/687230504962097152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4987612],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T11:11:35+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"687230504962097152"}]}}
