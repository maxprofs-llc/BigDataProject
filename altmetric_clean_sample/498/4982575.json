In this study, an aroA gene was cloned from a Janibacter sp. strain isolated from marine sediment (designated as aroAJ. sp). The purified aroAJ. sp enzyme has a Km value of 30\u2009\u03bcM for PEP and 83\u2009\u03bcM for S3P, and a significantly higher Ki value for glyphosate (373\u2009\u03bcM) than aroAE. coli. AroAJ. sp is characterized as a novel and naturally occurring class I aroA enzyme with glyphosate tolerance. Furthermore, we show that aroAJ. sp can be used as an effective selectable marker in both japonica and indica rice cultivar. Transgenic rice lines were tested by herbicide bioassay and it was confirmed that they could tolerate up to 3360\u2009g\/ha glyphosate, a dosage four-fold that of the recommended agricultural application level. To our knowledge, it is the first report of a naturally occurring novel class I aroA gene which can be efficiently utilized to study and develop transgenic glyphosate-tolerant crops, and can facilitate a more economical and simplified weed control system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Shu-yuan Yi","Ying Cui","Yan Zhao","Zi-duo Liu","Yong-jun Lin","Fei Zhou"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep19104","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T10:28:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1452794618,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep19104?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/srep19104"],"pmcid":"PMC4709569","pmid":"26754957","pubdate":"2016-01-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Applied microbiology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular engineering in plants","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"A Novel Naturally Occurring Class I 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase from Janibacter sp.
