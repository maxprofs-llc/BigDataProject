For this aim, active and living biomaterials are required to avoid the current drastic treatment, which is the removal of all the cellular and molecular content regardless of its regenerative potential. The regeneration of the pulp tissue is the dream of many generations of dental surgeons and will revolutionize clinical practices. Recently, the potential of the regenerative medicine field suggests that it would be possible to achieve such complex regeneration. Indeed, three crucial steps are needed: the control of infection and inflammation and the regeneration of lost pulp tissues. For regenerative medicine, in particular for dental pulp regeneration, the use of nano-structured biomaterials becomes decisive. Nano-designed materials allow the concentration of many different functions in a small volume, the increase in the quality of targeting, as well as the control of cost and delivery of active molecules. Nanomaterials based on extracellular mimetic nanostructure and functionalized with multi-active therapeutics appear essential to reverse infection and inflammation and concomitantly to orchestrate pulp cell colonization and differentiation. This novel generation of nanomaterials seems very promising to meet the challenge of the complex dental pulp regeneration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52e3cf058f6100041bc","authors":["Laetitia Keller"],"doi":"10.3390\/ma8115387","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T04:18:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1996-1944"],"issue":"11","journal":"Materials (1996-1944)","last_mentioned_on":1452617721,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/8\/11\/5387?utm_content=buffer49f35&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/8\/11\/5387?utm_content=buffer690f3&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1996-1944\/8\/11\/5387\/pdf","pmid":"28793649","pubdate":"2015-11-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Active Nanomaterials to Meet the Challenge of Dental Pulp Regeneration","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/active-nanomaterials-meet-challenge-dental-pulp-regeneration"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6945952,"mean":6.2265228839048,"rank":5956356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6945952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304482,"mean":9.1249509427515,"rank":248491,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304482,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":643,"mean":1.0029345794393,"rank":528,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":1.2278378378378,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
