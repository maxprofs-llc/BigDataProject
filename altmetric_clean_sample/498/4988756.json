The multifunctional aerogel was characterized by means of XRD, SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, and UV\/Vis absorption spectroscopy. The multifunctional aerogel had an ultralow density of 8\u2005mg\u2009cm(-3) and a superhigh surface area of 2650\u2005m(2) \u2009g(-1) . The multifunctional aerogel was thermal stability and compressible. Meanwhile, the multifunctional aerogel exhibited high capacity for the adsorption of oils and organic solvents, unexpectedly high hydrogen adsorption and good electrochemical performance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Zhu, Jiayi","Yang, Xi","Fu, Zhibing","He, Junhui","Wang, Chaoyang","Wu, Weidong","Zhang, Lin"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201504309","endpage":"2524","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T22:53:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"7","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452696472,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201504309"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201504309\/pdf","pmid":"26752085","pubdate":"2016-01-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u2010VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2515","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Three\u2010Dimensional Macroassembly of Sandwich\u2010Like, Hierarchical, Porous Carbon\/Graphene Nanosheets towards Ultralight, Superhigh Surface Area, Multifunctional Aerogels","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/threedimensional-macroassembly-sandwichlike-hierarchical-porous-carbongraphene-nanosheets-towards-ul"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5968129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145987163011,"rank":249025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4684,"mean":2.9730595771941,"rank":3186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":3.7045386819484,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
