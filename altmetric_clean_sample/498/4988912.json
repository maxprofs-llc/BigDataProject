However, specific pharmacological treatment approaches for patients with OCD during pregnancy have not been satisfactorily discussed in the literature. In addition, there are no randomized controlled studies on the treatment of this disorder during pregnancy. The present paper discusses the pharmacological treatment of OCD in the light of data on the safety of antipsychotics and serotonergic antidepressants during pregnancy and their efficacy in the non-perinatal period. Treatment decisions should be individualized because the risk-benefit profile of pharmacotherapy is an important issue in the treatment of pregnant women with any psychiatric diagnosis.","authors":["Uguz, Faruk"],"doi":"10.1590\/1516-4446-2015-1673","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T23:16:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1809-452X","1516-4446"],"issue":"4","journal":"Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria","last_mentioned_on":1463781795,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-44462015000400011&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26692431?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=anxietynews"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/rbp\/v37n4\/1516-4446-rbp-37-04-00334.pdf","pmid":"26692431","pubdate":"2016-01-14T22:25:13+00:00","publisher":"Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Psiquiatria (ABP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder during pregnancy: a clinical approach","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacotherapy-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-during-pregnancy-clinical-approach-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
