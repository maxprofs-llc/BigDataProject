Yttria-stabilized zirconia has been extensively studied for IMF applications, but the low thermal conductivity of this material limits its usefulness. Other elements can be used to stabilize the cubic zirconia structure, and the thermal conductivity of the fuel can be increased through the use of a lighter stabilizing element. To this end, a series of NdxScyZr1-x-yO2-\u03b4 materials has been synthesized via a co-precipitation reaction and characterized by multiple techniques (Nd was used as a surrogate for Am). The long-range and local structures of these materials were studied using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, the stability of these materials over a range of temperatures has been studied by annealing the materials at 1100 and 1400 \u00b0C. It was shown that the NdxScyZr1-x-yO2-\u03b4 materials maintained a single cubic phase upon annealing at high temperatures only when both Nd and Sc were present with y \u2265 0.10 and x + y > 0.15.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["John R.
