Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE\u00ae) antibody construct that transiently links CD3-positive T cells to CD19-positive B cells. This phase 2 study evaluated stepwise (9-28-112 \u00b5g\/day with weekly dose increases; n=23) or flat (112 \u00b5g\/day; n=2) dosing of blinatumomab by continuous infusion, with dexamethasone prophylaxis, in patients with relapsed\/refractory DLBCL. Patients received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. Median time since last regimen was 1.5 months. Seventeen patients ended treatment in cycle 1 (induction), 7 in cycle 2 (consolidation), and 1 in retreatment. Among 21 evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) after 1 blinatumomab cycle was 43%, including complete response (CR) in 19%. Three patients had late CR in follow-up without other treatment. The most common adverse events with stepwise dosing were tremor (48%), pyrexia (44%), fatigue (26%), and edema (26%). Grade 3 neurologic events with stepwise dosing were encephalopathy and aphasia (each 9%), and tremor, speech disorder, dizziness, somnolence, and disorientation (each 4%). Of 5 (22%) patients who discontinued stepwise dosing because of adverse events, 4 (17%) had neurologic events. Most neurologic events resolved. The flat dose cohort was stopped because of grade 3 neurologic events in both patients. Blinatumomab monotherapy appears effective in patients with relapsed\/refractory DLBCL, a heavily pretreated patient population with a high unmet medical need. Further studies need to define the optimal approach to achieve the target dose without early dropout. The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01741792.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cba","authors":["Viardot, Andreas","Goebeler, Marie-Elisabeth","Hess, Georg","Neumann, Svenja","Pfreundschuh, Michael","Adrian, Nicole","Zettl, Florian","Libicher, Martin","Sayehli, Cyrus","Stieglmaier, Julia","Zhang, Alicia","Nagorsen, Dirk","Bargou, Ralf C","Andreas Viardot","Marie-Elisabeth Goebeler","Georg Hess","Svenja Neumann","Michael Pfreundschuh","Nicole Adrian","Florian Zettl","Martin Libicher","Cyrus Sayehli","Julia Stieglmaier","Alicia Zhang","Dirk Nagorsen","Ralf C.
