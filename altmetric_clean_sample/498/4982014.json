Forty-five Gray (Gy) were delivered in nine fractions of 5\u00a0Gy given on a weekly basis. Acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity scale. Sexual function and sexual bother were assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire.\nBetween March 2006 and August 2008, 80 patients were treated, with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range 64-72). The median follow-up was 83 months (interquartile range 73-85 months). At 7 years, overall survival was 88%. No patients died of prostate cancer. Cumulative grade \u22652 genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity was reported for 31.3% and 30% of our patients, respectively. Cumulative grade \u22653 genitourinary and gastrointestinal late toxicity was seen in 3.8% and 12.5% of cases, respectively. Late genitourinary grade 2 toxicity was correlated with the occurrence of acute genitourinary grade 2 toxicity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). The occurrence of late gastrointestinal toxicity was not correlated with acute gastrointestinal toxicity. Pre-treatment EPIC sexual function was low (37.5%) and the mean EPIC sexual function score at 7 years after treatment was 14%. On the other hand, pre-treatment EPIC sexual bother reached 80.5%, meaning little bother, and remained stable during follow-up.\nOnce-weekly 3D-CRT leads to excellent biochemical disease-free survival and acceptable toxicities. Pre-treatment EPIC sexual function dropped by 42% at 5 years of follow-up. This functional deficit did not bother patients, possibly due to the already low sexual function at baseline.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256a","authors":["Zimmermann, M","Taussky, D","Menkarios, C","Vigneault, \u00c9","Beauchemin, M-C","Bahary, J-P","Martin, A-A-G","Diaz de Bedoya, L-V","Lambert, C"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clon.2015.12.024","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T07:16:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["09366555","1433-2981"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1462128621,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0936655515005075&_version=1&md5=556ae111d02fd08536d34caf69bfad97"],"pmid":"26782838","pubdate":"2016-01-20T22:01:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Prospective Phase II Trial of Once-weekly Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Low-risk Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate: Late Toxicities and Outcomes ","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prospective-phase-ii-trial-onceweekly-hypofractionated-radiation-therapy-lowrisk-adenocarcinoma-pros"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7632130,"mean":6.5668397124796,"rank":3947999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2142033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7632130,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":313433,"mean":9.2853802547281,"rank":163839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":114783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":313433,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":578,"mean":4.4025511265165,"rank":264,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":578,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":11.11619047619,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
