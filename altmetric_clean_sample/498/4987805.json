Six systems of supranuclear control mechanisms play a crucial role in this regard. These are the saccadic system, the smooth pursuit system, the vestibular system, the optokinetic system, the fixation system, and the vergence system. In gaze disorders, lesions at different levels of the brain spare some of the eye movement systems while affecting others. The resulting pattern of eye movements helps clinicians to localize lesions accurately in the central nervous system. Common lesions causing gaze palsies include cerebral infarcts, demyelinating lesions, multiple sclerosis, tumors, Wernicke's encephalopathy, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy. Evaluation of the different gaze disorders is a bane of most budding neurologists and neurosurgeons. However, a simple and systematic clinical approach to this problem can make their early diagnosis rather easy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f610003199","authors":["Vinny, Pulikottil Wilson","Lal, Vivek"],"doi":"10.4103\/0028-3886.173627","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T20:58:02+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0028-3886"],"issue":"1","journal":"Neurology India","last_mentioned_on":1452684395,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26755003?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26755003","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Gaze disorders: A clinical approach.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gaze-disorders-clinical-approach-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5968023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.114547905958,"rank":248997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283,"mean":1.3784680851064,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.75,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/687234282411053056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4987805],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T11:26:35+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":211},"tweet_id":"687234282411053056"}]}}
