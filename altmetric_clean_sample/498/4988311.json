Here, we present the genome sequence of D.orientale FH5(T), which contains 5,132,075bp with a G+C content of 41.31%. The genome sequence will contribute to a better understanding of the physiology of this species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080c9","authors":["Li, Xiaoli","Song, Lai","Wang, Guoliang","Ren, Lufeng","Yu, Dan","Chen, Guanjun","Wang, Xumin","Yu, Jun","Liu, Guiming","Du, Zongjun"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.margen.2016.01.002","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T21:59:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18747787","1876-7478"],"journal":"Marine Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1452864923,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1874778716300022"],"pmid":"26796622","pubdate":"2016-01-23T22:01:11+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","genetics"],"title":"Complete genome sequence of a deeply branched marine Bacteroidia bacterium Draconibacterium orientale type strain FH5T ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/complete-genome-sequence-deeply-branched-marine-bacteroidia-bacterium-draconibacterium-orientale-typ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6977329,"mean":6.2360291658897,"rank":2993501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3955319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6977329,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305226,"mean":9.1198558243916,"rank":128327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":174770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305226,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":216,"mean":1.9601581395349,"rank":69,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":147,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":216,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.00125,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
