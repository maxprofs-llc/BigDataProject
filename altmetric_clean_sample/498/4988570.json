Several iron-related genes are highly expressed in the liver, a tissue in which hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) plays a critical role in controlling gene expression. Therefore, the role of hepatic HNF4\u03b1 in iron homeostasis was examined using liver-specific HNF4\u03b1-null mice (Hnf4a(\u0394H) mice). Hnf4a(\u0394H) mice exhibit hypoferremia and a significant change in hepatic gene expression. Notably, the expression of transferrin receptor 2 (Tfr2) mRNA was markedly decreased in Hnf4a(\u0394H) mice. Promoter analysis of the Tfr2 gene showed that the basal promoter was located at a GC-rich region upstream of the transcription start site, a region that can be transactivated in an HNF4\u03b1-independent manner. HNF4\u03b1-dependent expression of Tfr2 was mediated by a proximal promoter containing two HNF4\u03b1 binding sites located between the transcription start site and the translation start site. Both the GC-rich region of the basal promoter and the HNF4\u03b1 binding sites were required for maximal transactivation. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of HNF4\u03b1 suppressed Tfr2 expression in human HCC cells. These results suggest that Tfr2 is a novel target gene for HNF4\u03b1 and hepatic HNF4\u03b1 plays a critical role in iron homeostasis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Shunsuke Matsuo","Masayuki Ogawa","Martina U.
