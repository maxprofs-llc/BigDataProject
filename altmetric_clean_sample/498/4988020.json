A questionnaire was sent to all foundation doctors in Scotland (n\u00a0=\u00a01602, response rate 34%) asking them about their career intention in relation to General Practice, whether they received career advice and the extent to which certain factors influenced their career choice. For the majority of trainees, General Practice was not their first choice but just under half were considering it as a career. There were significant differences in career choices between the four Scottish regions and between the medical schools, with a greater proportion of those who studied in Aberdeen and Dundee Medical Schools opting for a career in General Practice. Undergraduate GP placement was reported as the strongest influence in favour of a career in General Practice followed by discussion with family and friends and discussion with speciality trainees. There were differences between medical schools in the way hospital placements, General Practice placements and role models influenced career choices. Career advice on General Practice was reported to be less available and more difficult to find.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002782","authors":["Sharon Wiener-Ogilvie"],"doi":"10.1080\/14739879.2015.1101869","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T21:24:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-9879"],"issue":"6","journal":"Education for Primary Care","last_mentioned_on":1452695680,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14739879.2015.1101869"],"pmid":"26808935","pubdate":"2016-01-26T22:00:10+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["education","primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Foundation doctors career choice and factors influencing career choice","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/foundation-doctors-career-choice-factors-influencing-career-choice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":2590110,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":4329002,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145913406061,"rank":103956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":198638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128,"mean":3.3157480314961,"rank":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.5893939393939,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
