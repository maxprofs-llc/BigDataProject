Diagnostic angiography and computed tomography revealed total occlusion with severe calcification in the terminal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries. We performed endovascular treatment. Although a guidewire antegradely passed the occlusive lesion of the left CIA, no balloon or microcatheter could pass the lesion. Therefore, we used the GuideLiner catheter to facilitate balloon catheter delivery. The GuideLiner catheter advanced into the occlusive lesion, and the balloon crossed the lesion. This is a first report of the use of the GuideLiner catheter in peripheral intervention.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006ded","authors":["Kubota, Hiroshi","Kato, Taku","Nomura, Tetsuya","Keira, Natsuya","Tatsumi, Tetsuya"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12928-016-0377-1","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T18:27:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1868-4297"],"journal":"Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1452675594,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26754846"],"pmid":"26754846","pubdate":"2016-01-13T22:02:40+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Interventional Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Successful endovascular treatment with GuideLiner catheter of chronic aortic occlusion with severe calcification.","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5967940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145118470049,"rank":248961,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":0.66617647058824,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.45,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drtars\/statuses\/687197365825044480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4986944],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T08:59:54+00:00","author":{"name":"Tars the Robot","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_6_normal.png","id_on_source":"drtars","tweeter_id":"3982165613","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":10},"tweet_id":"687197365825044480"}]}}
