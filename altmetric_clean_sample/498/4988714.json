Here, rGO-coated or sandwiched CoSx composites are fabricated through facile thermal sulfurization of metal-organic framework\/GO precursors. By scrupulously changing the proportion of Co(2+) and organic ligands and the solvent of the reaction system, we can tune the forms of GO as either a coating or a supporting layer. Upon testing as anode materials for LIBs, the as-prepared CoSx -rGO-CoSx and rGO@CoSx composites demonstrate brilliant electrochemical performances such as high initial specific capacities of 1248 and 1320\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) , respectively, at a current density of 100\u2005mA\u2009g(-1) , and stable cycling abilities of 670 and 613\u2005mA\u2009h\u2009g(-1) , respectively, after 100 charge\/discharge cycles, as well as superior rate capabilities. The excellent electrical conductivity and porous structure of the CoSx \/rGO composites can promote Li(+) transfer and mitigate internal stress during the charge\/discharge process, thus significantly improving the electrochemical performance of electrode materials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Yin, Dongming","Huang, Gang","Zhang, Feifei","Qin, Yuling","Na, Zhaolin","Wu, Yaoming","Wang, Limin"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201504399","endpage":"1474","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T22:50:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"],"issue":"4","journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1452696040,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/chem.201504399"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201504399\/pdf","pmid":"26748911","pubdate":"2016-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"1467","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Coated\/Sandwiched rGO\/CoSx Composites Derived from Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks\/GO as Advanced Anode Materials for Lithium\u2010Ion Batteries","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coatedsandwiched-rgocosx-composites-derived-metalorganic-frameworksgo-advanced-anode-materials-lithi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5968128,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145978967794,"rank":249024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4684,"mean":2.9730595771941,"rank":3186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":350,"mean":3.7045386819484,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":350,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
