The fusion gene is constructed by seamless ligation of 5'-end phosphorylated blunt ends instead of by overlap extension PCR (OE-PCR). Therefore, the challenge of amplifying large DNA fragments (e.g., the large bifunctional enzyme gene constructed by fusion of two monofunctional enzyme genes) by PCR can be avoided. In addition, synthesis of the inner primers for OE-PCR is not necessary, indicating that this method should be especially convenient for construction of fusion genes with various combinations of multiple fragments (e.g., chimeric gene libraries, fusion gene libraries). As a modification of the commonly used fusion gene construction technique, this method may find a wide range of applications in bioscience and biotechnology.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c0","authors":["Gao, Song","Zhang, Jiannan","Miao, Tianjin","Ma, Di","Su, Ying","An, Yingfeng","Zhang, Qingrui","Song Gao","Jiannan Zhang","Tianjin Miao","Di Ma","Ying Su","Yingfeng An","Qingrui Zhang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10528-015-9669-x","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T13:00:59+00:00","issns":["1573-4927","0006-2928"],"journal":"Biochemical Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1491355463,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25820211?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10528-015-9669-x"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10528-015-9669-x.pdf","pmid":"25820211","pubdate":"2015-03-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Genetics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"A Simple and Convenient Sticky\/Blunt-End Ligation Method for Fusion Gene Construction.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/simple-convenient-stickybluntend-ligation-method-fusion-gene-construction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":2094664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6326581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":74},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":323454,"mean":9.4493731886854,"rank":91458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":230506,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":323454,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":156,"mean":2.5353677419355,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":156,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.60714285714286,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
