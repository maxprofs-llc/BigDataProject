Setting up the partial lesion model can be challenging because a number of experimental settings can be altered. This study compares seven experimental settings in a single study on d-amphetamine-induced rotations, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurites in the striatum, dopamine transporter (DAT)-positive neurites in the striatum, and TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in rats. Moreover, we validate a new algorithm for estimating the number of TH-positive cells. We show that the behavior and immunoreactivity vary greatly depending on the injection settings, and we categorize the lesions as progressive, stable, or regressive based on d-amphetamine-induced rotations. The rotation behavior correlated with the degree of the lesion, analyzed by immunohistochemistry; the largest lesions were in the progressive group, and the smallest lesions were in the regressive group. We establish a new low-dose partial 6-OHDA lesion model in which a total of 6\u2009\u03bcg was distributed evenly to three sites in the striatum at a 10\u00b0 angle. The administration of low-dose 6-OHDA produced stable and reliable rotation behavior and induced partial loss of striatal TH-positive and DAT-positive neurites and TH-positive cells in the SNpc. This model is highly suitable for neurorestoration studies in the search for new therapies for PD, and the new algorithm increases the efficacy for estimating the number of dopamine neurons. This study can be extremely useful for laboratories setting up the partial 6-OHDA model. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d97","authors":["Penttinen, Anna\u2010Maija","Suleymanova, Ilida","Albert, Katrina","Anttila, Jenni","Voutilainen, Merja H.","Airavaara, Mikko"],"doi":"10.1002\/jnr.23708","endpage":"328","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T21:40:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4547"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1479052541,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/jnr.23708","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23708\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23708\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jnr.23708\/pdf","pmid":"26762168","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"318","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Characterization of a new low\u2010dose 6\u2010hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease in rat","type":"article","volume":"94","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-new-lowdose-6hydroxydopamine-model-parkinsons-disease-rat-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.05,"score_history":{"1y":3.45,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7825991,"mean":6.6350643478917,"rank":1455613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6364818,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7825991,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315741,"mean":9.2897864952173,"rank":70121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":245258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315741,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1103,"mean":5.2435372050817,"rank":278,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":824,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1103,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.2727272727273,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
