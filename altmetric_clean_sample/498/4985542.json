Research indicates that adaptive coping strategies can reduce the burden that pain has on patients. Yet, it is unknown whether coping strategies can also affect the physical and mental of the spouses of patients with chronic pain. In the present research, we investigated the role of coping strategies employed by spouses of patients with pain in the relationship between the pain intensity of the patients and the physical and mental health of their spouses. The study comprised 195 heterosexual couples. 41% of spouses were females. Our results showed that being older, having a lower educational level, having a negative orientation towards problems and using impulsive strategies to cope when in difficult situations contributed to poorer physical health of spouses. A poorer mental health status of spouses was associated with being negatively oriented towards problems, being a female, and being a caregiver of mentally distressed patient. Additionally, it was found that the impulsive-careless coping strategy employed by the spouses moderated the relationship between patients' pain severity and physical health of their spouses. At low levels of patients' pain intensity as rated by spouses, spouses reported similar levels of physical health irrespective of coping ratings. Conversely, at high levels of patients' pain intensity as rated by spouses, poorer physical health was reported by spouses scoring high on impulsive-careless coping. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.\nThis article addresses the role of spousal coping in the relationship between patients' pain intensity and the physical and mental health of their spouses. Our findings suggest that screening for coping strategies employed by spouses of patients with pain might complement clinical interventions aimed at promoting the physical and mental health of patients and their partners.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f6100057ff","authors":["Suso-Ribera, Carlos","Yakobov, Esther","Ribera-Canudas, M Victoria"],"doi":"10.1097\/ajp.0000000000000328","endpage":"762","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T02:20:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-5409","0749-8047"],"issue":"9","journal":"Clinical journal of pain","last_mentioned_on":1471145127,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/9000\/00000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.99208.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/9000\/00000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.99208.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/Abstract\/2016\/09000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.3.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.3.aspx?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/9000\/00000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.99208.pdf","pmid":"26710226","pubdate":"2016-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"755","subjects":["psychophysiology","neurology"],"title":"Coping is Important for Spouses Too: Impulsive Coping Moderates the Relationship between Spouses' Perception of the Patients' Pain Intensity and Spouses' Physical Health.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/clinicalpain\/Fulltext\/2016\/09000\/Coping_is_Important_for_Spouses_Too__Impulsive.3.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coping-important-spouses"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8213437,"mean":6.9553152651275,"rank":3517822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4659792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8213437,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320380,"mean":9.4323105759113,"rank":119018,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":199238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320380,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1380,"mean":5.7003002175489,"rank":693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":674,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1380,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":12.83714893617,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Psychology":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ClinJrnlPain\/statuses\/687066472724627457","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4985542],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T00:19:46+00:00","author":{"name":"ClinicalJrnlPain","url":"http:\/\/www.clinicalpain.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000026493711\/0c8e1964c5af495bdd6050bcbc114e30_normal.jpeg","description":"The Clinical Journal of Pain explores pain and its effective treatment, bringing the insights of anesthesiologists, surgeons, internists, and neurologists.","id_on_source":"ClinJrnlPain","tweeter_id":"343396100","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":263},"tweet_id":"687066472724627457"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrEdKeogh\/statuses\/688101363880886272","license":"gnip","rt":["ClinJrnlPain"],"citation_ids":[4985542],"posted_on":"2016-01-15T20:52:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Ed Keogh","url":"http:\/\/www.bath.ac.uk\/pain","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/453504055239655425\/bicCd3cv_normal.jpeg","description":"Research interests in the psychology of pain, sex and gender differences in pain, cognition and emotion | pain communication | men's health.
