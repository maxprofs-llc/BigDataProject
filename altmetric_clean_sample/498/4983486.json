See on AIDS journal."],"citation":{"abstract":"The effect of HIV on tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes (TO) has not been well established. We aimed to assess the impact of HIV infection on TB TO by using data from notifiable disease surveillance in Europe.\nWe analyzed the TO of TB cases reported from nine European countries during 2010-2012. We investigate the effect of HIV on TB TO using a multilevel and a multinomial logistic models, and considering the interaction between HIV and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB.\nA total of 61138 TB cases including 5.5% HIV-positive were eligible for our analysis. In the multilevel model adjusted for age and an interaction with MDR-TB, HIV was significantly associated with lower treatment success in all MDR strata [Non-MDR-TB: odds ratio (OR) 0.24 CI 0.20-0.29; Unknown MDR-TB status: OR 0.26 CI 0.23-0.30; MDR-TB: OR 0.57 CI 0.35-0.91]In the multinomial regression model, HIV-positive cases had significantly higher relative risk ratio (RRR) for death [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 4.30 CI 2.31-7.99; Unknown MDR-TB status: 5.55 CI 3.10-9.92; MDR-TB: 3.59 CI 1.56-8.28] and being \"still on treatment' [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 7.27 CI 3.00-17.6; Unknown MDR-TB status: 5.36 CI 2.44-11.8; MDR-TB: 3.76 CI 2.48-5.71]. We did not find any significant association between HIV and TB treatment failure [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 0.50 CI 0.15-1.67; Unknown MDR-TB status: 1.51 CI 0.86-2.64; MDR-TB: 0.51 CI 0.13-1.87] CONCLUSION:: This large study confirms that HIV is a strong risk factor for an adverse TB treatment outcome, which is mainly manifested by an increased risk of death and still being on TB treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006920","authors":["Karo, Basel","Krause, G\u00e9rard","Hollo, Vahur","van der Werf, Marieke J","Castell, Stefanie","Hamouda, Osamah","Haas, Walter","van der Werf, Marieke J."],"doi":"10.1097\/qad.0000000000001016","endpage":"1098","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T13:07:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0269-9370","1473-5571"],"issue":"7","journal":"AIDS","last_mentioned_on":1481108798,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/The_impact_of_HIV_infection_on_treatment_outcome.97873.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/pages\/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&issue=00000&article=97873&type=abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26752278","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26752278","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Abstract\/2016\/04240\/Impact_of_HIV_infection_on_treatment_outcome_of.12.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/9000\/00000\/The_impact_of_HIV_infection_on_treatment_outcome.97873.pdf","pmid":"26752278","pubdate":"2016-01-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1089","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"The impact of HIV infection on treatment outcome of tuberculosis: analysis of surveillance data from nine European countries, 2010-2012.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aidsonline\/Fulltext\/2016\/04240\/Impact_of_HIV_infection_on_treatment_outcome_of.12.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-hiv-infection-treatment-outcome-tuberculosis-europe-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.85,"score_history":{"1y":2.85,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":1317136,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6534828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":315716,"mean":9.3120089321062,"rank":64612,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":250853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":315716,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3345,"mean":4.7530897129187,"rank":647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3345,"percentile":80},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":6.1575324675325,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":62,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":7,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
