Overall, 12% of samples yielded Gram-negative bacteria, with no significant differences between the standard [11.9% (94\/788)] and strict [12.1% (82\/678)] regimens (P\u00a0=\u00a00.92). Significantly more samples were contaminated when expressed at home (standard regimen home\/hospital: 17.9% vs 6.1%; strict regimen home\/hospital: 19.6% vs 3.4%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Bacterial contamination of EBM was not associated with the regimen, but was associated with the location of breast milk expression. Attempts to improve personal hygiene during milk collection seem to be of limited value. Good hygiene of collection and storage equipment is likely to be the most important way to ensure the microbiological quality of EBM.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a48","authors":["Haiden, N","Pimpel, B","Assadian, O","Binder, C","Kreissl, A","Repa, A","Thanh\u00e4user, M","Roberts, C D","Berger, A"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jhin.2015.11.018","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T14:37:05+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["01956701","1532-2939"],"journal":"Journal of Hospital Infection","last_mentioned_on":1452609213,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0195670115005241"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.journalofhospitalinfection.com\/article\/S0195670115005241\/pdf","pmid":"26850928","pubdate":"2016-02-07T22:00:27+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hospitals","communicablediseases"],"title":"Comparison of bacterial counts in expressed breast milk following standard or strict infection control regimens in neonatal intensive care units: compliance of mothers does matter ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-bacterial-counts-expressed-breast-milk-following-standard-strict-infection-control-regime"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6945952,"mean":6.2265228839048,"rank":3417097,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2022356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6945952,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304481,"mean":9.1249661324223,"rank":157155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":114174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304481,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":926,"mean":5.8641189189189,"rank":568,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":926,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":3.8902,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
