Changes in redox potential of the glutathione system, activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and intensity of apoptotic cell death were evaluated. The results indicate that incubation with N-ethylmaleimide led to glutathione system imbalance, reduced tumor cell redox potential, and induced their programmed death, which seemed useful for prospective target therapy of tumor diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000246e","authors":["Shakhristova, E V","Stepovaya, E A","Ryazantseva, N V","Nosareva, O L","Yakushina, V D","Ivanov, V V","Novitskii, V V"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10517-016-3172-1","first_seen_on":"2016-01-12T11:58:37+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1573-8221"],"issue":"3","journal":"Bulletin of Experimental Biology & Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1452599901,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26750929?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26750929","pubdate":"2016-01-12T22:00:51+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Laboratory Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Role of Glutathione System Redox Potential in Apoptosis Dysregulation in MCF-7 Breast Adenocarcinoma.","type":"article","volume":"160","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-glutathione-system-redox-potential-apoptosis-dysregulation-mcf7-breast-adenocarcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6945952,"mean":6.2265228839048,"rank":5956282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6945952,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304481,"mean":9.1249467551233,"rank":248468,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304481,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":439,"mean":1.3413424657534,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":439,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.53076923076923,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/686879885889933312","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4983146],"posted_on":"2016-01-12T11:58:21+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"686879885889933312"}]}}
