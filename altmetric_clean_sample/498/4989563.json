Due to their multifunctional activities such as promoting skin cell proliferation and stimulating collagen formation, growth factors may participate in skin rejuvenation at various levels. The present placebo-controlled study aimed to further investigate the antiaging effects of a novel skin cream containing a mixture of human growth factors and cytokines, which was obtained through a biotechnology process using cultured human fetal fibroblasts. Aside from clinical assessment of skin wrinkles, the skin surface topography was analyzed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging using the Phaseshift Rapid in vivo Measurement of Skin (PRIMOS) device. This device allows fast, contact-free, and direct measurement of the skin surface topography in vivo at high resolution. This technique is quantitative and more reliable than a visual assessment of wrinkles using a scoring system, which is subjective and strongly dependent on investigator and assessment conditions. Using the PRIMOS device, which is also regarded as a more accurate method than the commonly used silicon replica technique, skin surface roughness was shown to significantly decrease between 10% and 18% depending on the roughness parameter after 2 months of twice-daily application of the human growth factor and cytokine cream. This was compared to treatment with the placebo formulation resulting in an approximate 10% decrease of 2 roughness parameters, whereas the remaining parameters remained unchanged. We found that topical application of growth factors and cytokines are beneficial in reducing signs of skin aging.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa7053cf058f61000a4d4","authors":["Gold, Michael H","Goldman, Mitchel P","Biron, Julie"],"first_seen_on":"2016-01-14T00:49:23+00:00","issns":["1545-9616"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Drugs in Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1452710947,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/17966179\/"],"pmid":"17966179","pubdate":"2007-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/human-growth-factor-cytokine-skin-cream-facial-skin-rejuvenation-assessed-3d-vivo-optical-skin-imagi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":3428198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":2022956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305170,"mean":9.1086590118915,"rank":157569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":114376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305170,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.3240597609562,"rank":188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":46},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":3.4854545454545,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Chemistry":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TrueToneClinic\/statuses\/687345647134076928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4989563],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T18:49:07+00:00","author":{"name":"True Tone Aesthetics","url":"http:\/\/www.truetoneaesthetics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/558783925615874048\/Iw8w4tPh_normal.jpeg","description":"True Tone combines safe clinical practice with well researched treatment options, using state of the art technology to ensure your journey to skin perfection.","id_on_source":"TrueToneClinic","tweeter_id":"2993851332","geo":{"lt":51.48333,"ln":-0.6,"country":"GB"},"followers":312},"tweet_id":"687345647134076928"}]}}
