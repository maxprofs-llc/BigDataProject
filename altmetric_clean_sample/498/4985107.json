Two groups consisting of 25 weight-lifters and 25 track and field athletes were studied to find out the effect of sports activities and lifting weights on the spine. 84% weight-lifters and 72% track and field athletes suffered from varying abnormalities. Incidence of backache in 25 weight-lifters was 40% and in 25 track and field athletes 48%. Radiological changes were more common in weight-lifters (84%) than in athletes (72%). Reduction in lumbar lordosis was found in three cases (12%) in both the groups. Obtuse angle deformity of vertebral margins was found in 11 cases (44%) amongst weight-lifters and six cases (24%) amongst athletes. Osteophytic formation was found in six cases (24%) in weight-lifters and four cases (16%) in athletes. Schmorl's node were noticed in five cases (20%) amongst weight-lifters and seven cases (28%) amongst athletes. The incidences of spondylosis and Schmorl's node were found only in those cases who had been doing weight training exercises for more than four years.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["N.
