Because melanocytes are located in the basal layer of the epidermis, melanoma is most commonly seen on the skin. However, melanoma can also arise on mucosal surfaces such as the oral cavity, the upper gastrointestinal mucosa, the genital mucosa, as well as the uveal tract of the eye and leptomeninges. Melanomas tend to be pigmented but can also present as pink or red lesions. They can mimic benign or other malignant skin lesions. This chapter presents the spectrum of typical and less typical presentations of melanoma, as well as patterns of spread. It is divided into (1) cutaneous lesions; (2) patterns of regional spread, (3) non-cutaneous lesions; and (4) distant metastases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000cfcf","authors":["Kibbi, Nour","Kluger, Harriet","Choi, Jennifer Nam"],"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-319-22539-5_4","first_seen_on":"2016-01-13T20:34:01+00:00","issns":["0927-3042"],"journal":"Cancer treatment and research","last_mentioned_on":1452682971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26601860?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26601860","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dermatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Oncology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pediatrics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Melanoma: Clinical Presentations.","type":"article","volume":"167","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/melanoma-clinical-presentations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6956879,"mean":6.2324552312088,"rank":5967955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6956879,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":305057,"mean":9.1145097162486,"rank":248963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":305057,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":4.4772911392405,"rank":64,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.7166666666667,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/statuses\/687228308296183808","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4987443],"posted_on":"2016-01-13T11:02:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!Curating #skin science.
