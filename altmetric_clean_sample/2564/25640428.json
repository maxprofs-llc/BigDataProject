The efficient induction of pluripotency requires the activation of innate immune signaling in a process termed \"transflammation\" [1]. Specifically, the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) causes global alterations in the expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers to favor an open chromatin configuration. Activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) or RIG-1-like receptors (RLR) [2] trigger signaling cascades that result in NF\u03baB or IRF-3 mediated changes in epigenetic plasticity that facilitate reprogramming. Another form of nuclear reprogramming is so-called direct reprogramming or transdifferentiation of one somatic cell to another lineage. We have shown that transdifferentiation of human fibroblasts to endothelial cells also involves transflammation [3]. Recently, we also identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4] and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [5] as mediators of innate immune signaling in nuclear reprogramming. Innate immune signaling plays a key role in nuclear reprogramming by regulating DNA accessibility (Figure 1). Here, we review recent progress of innate immunity signaling in nuclear reprogramming and epigenetic plasticity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000217e","authors":["Shu Meng","Palas Chanda","Rajarajan A.
