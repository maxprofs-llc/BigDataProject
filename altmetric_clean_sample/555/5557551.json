These include in particular unsuccessful arterial puncture and vascular injuries, which in addition to loss of blood can lead to massive soft tissue swelling. A 63-year-old female patient developed massive cervical bleeding during ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein puncture and the rapidly enlarging hematoma led to compromisation of the airway. A cannot intubate, cannot ventilate situation developed and the subsequent hypoxia led to cardiac arrest that was only resolved after emergency surgical tracheotomy during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f610000481","authors":["Engelen, C","Trebes, C","Czarnecki, S","Junger, A"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00101-015-0134-3","first_seen_on":"2016-02-14T05:01:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-055X"],"journal":"Anaesthesist","last_mentioned_on":1455426064,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26867603?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26867603","pubdate":"2016-02-14T22:02:56+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anesthesiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Intensive \/ Critical Care Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pain Medicine","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"[Bleeding during central venous catheterization : Cannot intubate, cannot ventilate due to massive cervical hematoma]","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blutung-bei-zvkanlage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7191979,"mean":6.3236280124852,"rank":5411382,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7191979,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":321210,"mean":9.6928514144992,"rank":223100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":53989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":321210,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":345,"mean":1.4375406976744,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":157,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":345,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.175,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Social Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"GB":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/698733675345682432","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5557551],"posted_on":"2016-02-14T05:01:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"698733675345682432"}]}}
