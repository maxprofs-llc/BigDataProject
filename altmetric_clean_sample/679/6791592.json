In the US, CDI causes approximately half a million infections and close to 30,000 deaths. Despite antibiotic treatment of C. difficile associated diarrhoea, the disease is complicated by its recurrence in up to 30% of patients.\nAn open-label, partially randomized, dose-escalation Phase I trial was performed in two parts. Sixty volunteers aged \u226518 to <65 years were randomized into five treatment groups to receive three immunizations (Day 0, 7, 21) of VLA84 (20\u03bcg with Alum, 75\u03bcg with or without Alum, 200\u03bcg with or without Alum). Eighty-one volunteers aged \u226565 were randomized into four treatment groups (75\u03bcg with or without Alum, 200\u03bcg with or without Alum) and received four immunizations (Day 0, 7, 28 and 56). All subjects were followed for safety and immunogenicity for six months.\nVLA84 was safe and well tolerated. Fifty-one adult volunteers (85%) and 50 elderly (62%) experienced at least one solicited or unsolicited adverse event (AE). Forty-eight adult volunteers (80%) and 40 elderly (49%) experienced related AEs which were mostly mild or moderate. No related serious adverse event and no death occurred. The vaccine induced high antibody titres against Toxin A and Toxin B in both study populations.\nVLA84 was safe, well tolerated and highly immunogenic in adult volunteers aged \u226518 to <65 years and elderly volunteers aged \u226565 years. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01296386.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","authors":["B\u00e9zay, Nicole","Ayad, Andrea","Dubischar, Katrin","Firbas, Christa","Hochreiter, Romana","Kiermayr, Sigrid","Kiss, Istv\u00e1n","Pinl, Fritz","Jilma, Bernd","Westritschnig, Kerstin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.vaccine.2016.03.098","first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T07:20:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2518","0264410X"],"issue":"23","journal":"Vaccine","last_mentioned_on":1462030164,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27079932?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0264410X16300950"],"pmid":"27079932","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Veterinary","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Safety, immunogenicity and dose response of VLA84, a new vaccine candidate against Clostridium difficile, in healthy volunteers","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-immunogenicity-dose-response-vla84-new-vaccine-candidate-against-clostridium-difficile-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7628277,"mean":6.5635637575213,"rank":5499220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1857333,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7628277,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268883,"mean":11.277008858904,"rank":172510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":80785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268883,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4829,"mean":7.3784270919635,"rank":3600,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1078,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4829,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":13.876681481481,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CDifficile1\/statuses\/722321622095409152","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6791592],"posted_on":"2016-04-19T07:11:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.cdifficile.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1633637124\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"CDifficile1","tweeter_id":"324789063","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":163},"tweet_id":"722321622095409152"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/greg_folkers\/statuses\/726433275644940289","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6791592],"posted_on":"2016-04-30T15:29:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Greg Folkers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000063259596\/220c952b0e03de1256e8135015fe9d43_normal.jpeg","description":"washington, dc || personal account || tweets\/retweets \u2260 endorsement || gregfolkers (at) yahoo (dot) com || global health\/infectious diseases","id_on_source":"greg_folkers","tweeter_id":"41626609","geo":{"lt":38.91706,"ln":-77.00025,"country":"US"},"followers":2774},"tweet_id":"726433275644940289"}]}}
