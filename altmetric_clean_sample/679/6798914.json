Since 2011, Leptocimex spp (Heteroptera: Cimicidae) has been reported in Thailand. However, microscopic examination of Leptocimex spp is complicated, especially when the entire body of the specimen is not available. To confirm the phenotypic identification of L. inordinatus from a limestone bat cave in Thailand, partial fragments of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene and 16S mitochondrial ribosomal DNA were PCR amplified and sequenced, which revealed 97% sequence identity with Cimicidae family members, being most similar to Cacodminae gen. sp. and C. vicinus, both bat bugs. Phylogenetic tree construction showed that L. inordinatus has a separate genetic lineage from that of with human bed bugs (Cimex hemipterus or C. lectularius), swallow bugs and other tick species. The presence of L. inordinatus in a bat-dwelling cave frequented by humans presents a potential public health problem requiring attention in particular regarding the possibility of zoonotic transmission of pathogens.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa86b3cf058f61000c62e","authors":["Potiwat, Rutcharin","Sungvornyothin, Sungsit","Samung, Yudthana","Payakkapol, Anon","Apiwathnasorn, Chamnarn"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T11:33:35+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0125-1562"],"issue":"1","journal":"Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1462611787,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27086421?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27086421","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"IDENTIFICATION OF BAT ECTOPARASITE LEPTOCIMEX INORDINATUS FROM BAT-DWELLING CAVE, KANCHANABURI PROVINCE, THAILAND.","type":"article","volume":"47"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":5796255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1032116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269193,"mean":11.280445548159,"rank":188247,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":43270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269193,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272,"mean":2.1089372693727,"rank":153,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.77777777777778,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/batpapers\/statuses\/722364890099220480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6798914],"posted_on":"2016-04-19T10:03:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Bat_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868693472189890561\/su_GIZCP_normal.jpg","description":"Tweets papers and preprints related to #bats #ecology #animalBehavior from #PubMed #Biorxiv.
