Ichthyoplankton community and environmental data were recorded during the autumns of 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2009. Among the ichthyoplankton, the dominant larval and juvenile families were the Engraulidae, Gobiidae and Salangidae, and the most common eggs were from Trichiurus lepturus. The ichthyoplankton was identified via canonical correspondence analysis to three assemblages: an estuary assemblage dominated by Chaeturichthys stigmatias, a coastal assemblage dominated by Engraulis japonicus and Stolephorus commersonii, and an offshore assemblage dominated by Trichiurus lepturus. Regarding environmental factors in the Yangtze Estuary, suspended matter and surface seawater salinity were the main factors influencing the distributions of the different assemblages, while sediment from the Yangtze River during the rainy season and chlorophyll a were the principle drivers of the annual variances in the distribution of ichthyoplankton assemblages. Our aims in this study were to provide detailed characterizations of the ichthyoplankton assemblage in the autumns of seven years, examine the long-term dynamics of autumn ichthyoplankton assemblages, and evaluate the influence of environmental factors on the spatial distribution and inter-annual variations of ichthyoplankton assemblages associated with the Yangtze Estuary.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Hui Zhang","Weiwei Xian","Shude Liu"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.1922","first_seen_on":"2016-04-19T08:24:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1461198624,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1922\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1922.pdf","pmid":"27114877","pubdate":"2016-04-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Autumn ichthyoplankton assemblage in the Yangtze Estuary shaped by environmental factors","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autumn-ichthyoplankton-assemblage-yangtze-estuary-shaped-environmental-factors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7584550,"mean":6.538792679956,"rank":3163307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4311581,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7584550,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268279,"mean":11.274072708161,"rank":106993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":156592,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268279,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3145,"mean":21.024198473282,"rank":2125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":946,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3145,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":327,"mean":16.214791411043,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":327,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/thePeerJ\/statuses\/722336951324565508","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6792464],"posted_on":"2016-04-19T08:12:04+00:00","author":{"name":"PeerJ - the journal","url":"https:\/\/peerj.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/528823665194844160\/elpQqrsv_normal.png","description":"The award-winning Open Access academic journal and publisher.
