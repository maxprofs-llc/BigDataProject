Published here"],"citation":{"abstract":"Patients who present in ventricular fibrillation are typically treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), epinephrine, antiarrhythmic medications, and defibrillation. Although these therapies have shown to be effective, some patients remain in a shockable rhythm. Double sequential external defibrillation has been described as a viable option for patients in refractory ventricular fibrillation.\nTo describe the innovative use of two defibrillators used to deliver double sequential external defibrillation by paramedics in a case of refractory ventricular fibrillation resulting in prehospital return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge with good neurologic function.\nA 28-year-old female sustained a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Bystander CPR was performed by her husband followed by paramedics providing high-quality CPR, antiarrhythmic medication, and 6 biphasic defibrillations using standard energy levels. Double sequential external defibrillation was applied and a return of spontaneous circulation was attained on scene and maintained through to arrival to the emergency department. Following admission to hospital the patient was diagnosed with long QT syndrome. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed and the patient was discharged with a Cerebral Performance Category of 2 as well as a modified Rankin Scale of 2 after an 18-day hospital stay. The patient's functional status continued to improve post discharge.\nThe addition of double sequential external defibrillation as part of a well-organized resuscitation effort may be a valid treatment option for OHCA patients who present in refractory ventricular fibrillation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005c4a","authors":["Johnston, Martin","Cheskes, Sheldon","Ross, Garry","Verbeek, P Richard","Martin Johnston","Sheldon Cheskes","Garry Ross","P.
