We examined the involvement of dorsal GP neurons in behavioral goal monitoring and maintenance, essential components of executive function. We trained two macaque monkeys to choose a reach target based on relative target position in a spatial goal task or a target shape in an object-goal task. The monkeys were trained to continue to choose a certain behavioral goal when reward volume was constant and to switch the goals when the volume began to decrease. Because the judgment for the next goal was made in the absence of visual signals, the monkeys were required to monitor and maintain the chosen goals during the reaching movement. We obtained three major findings. (1) GP neurons reflected more of the relative spatial position than the shape of the reaching target during the spatial goal task. During the object-goal task, the shape of the reaching object was represented more than the relative position. (2) The selectivity of individual neurons for the relative position was enhanced during the spatial goal task, whereas the object-shape selectivity was enhanced during the object-goal task. (3) When the monkeys switched the goals, the selectivity for either the position or shape also switched. Together, these findings suggest that the dorsal GP is involved in behavioral goal monitoring and maintenance during execution of goal-oriented actions, presumably in collaboration with the prefrontal cortex.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Yosuke Saga","Masashi Hashimoto","L\u00e9on Tremblay","Jun Tanji","Eiji Hoshi"],"doi":"10.1523\/jneurosci.1187-13.2013","first_seen_on":"2013-10-10T00:39:33+00:00","issns":["1529-2401"],"issue":"41","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1404720062,"links":["http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/41\/16360.abstract","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/41\/16360.full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24107966?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/41\/16360.short?rss=1","http:\/\/m.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/41\/16360.long"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jneurosci.org\/content\/33\/41\/16360.full.pdf","pmid":"24107966","pubdate":"2013-10-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society for Neuroscience","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"16360","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Representation of Spatial- and Object-Specific Behavioral Goals in the Dorsal Globus Pallidus of Monkeys during Reaching Movement.","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/representation-spatial-objectspecific-behavioral-goals-dorsal-globus-pallidus-monkeys-during-reachin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372581,"mean":7.0576484307032,"rank":2146923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5082614,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372581,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143654,"mean":7.2116443652414,"rank":37560,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":100390,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143654,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12541,"mean":10.15656507177,"rank":5025,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":6268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12541,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":331,"mean":12.084606060606,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":331,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":20,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
