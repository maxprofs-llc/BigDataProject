The space-developed ephyrae made graviceptors which were morphologically similar to those of their ground-based controls. Rhopalia of both groups developed statocysts with statoliths, ocelli, ciliated mechanoreceptor cells, and immature touch-plates with one type of hair cell. The number of rhopalia formed per arm of ephyrae of both groups revealed no significant differences. The number of statoliths formed per rhopalium was statistically higher in ephyrae which were induced to form in space with iodine than in L(Launch)+8h controls. Statolith numbers were not significantly different between Earth-formed control ephyrae and those formed from polyps induced on Earth and then sent into space 24h and 48h later. Statolith loss from rhopalia was significantly enhanced in the space-maintained ephyrae in ASW as compared to their controls. Ephyrae formed through thyroxine treatment and those maintained in thyroxine in space had statolith numbers comparable to thyroxine-treated controls. Pulsing abnormalities seen in some space-developed ephyrae suggest that some space-formed ephyrae may have developed abnormal rhopalia because normal rhopalia development and function is necessary for normal pulsing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002194","authors":["D B Spangenberg","T Jernigan","C Philput","B Lowe"],"first_seen_on":"2013-10-10T21:12:21+00:00","issns":["0273-1177"],"issue":"8","journal":"Advances in Space Research","last_mentioned_on":1382200200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11537934"],"pmid":"11537934","pubdate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Astronomical And Space Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Aerospace Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Engineering","Earth and Planetary Sciences","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["aerospacemedicine"],"title":"Graviceptor development in jellyfish ephyrae in space and on Earth.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/graviceptor-development-jellyfish-ephyrae-space-earth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":18,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":18},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622349,"mean":4.9310300946799,"rank":147416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":3473411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622349,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94256,"mean":7.7588653334042,"rank":6601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":87624,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94256,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":459,"mean":3.8219825327511,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":446,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":459,"percentile":97},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":3.5208,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
