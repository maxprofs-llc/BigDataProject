This virus class causes debilitating illnesses that are characterized by arthritis, arthralgia, and myalgia. In previous studies, we identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a critical inflammatory factor in the pathogenesis of alphaviral diseases. The present study was undertaken to characterize the role of CD74, a cell surface receptor of MIF, in both RRV- and CHIKV-induced alphavirus arthritides.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000231f","authors":["Herrero LJ","Sheng KC","Jian P","Taylor A","Her Z","Herring BL","Chow A","Leo YS","Hickey MJ","Morand EF","Ng LF","Bucala R","Mahalingam S","Herrero, Lara J.","Sheng, Kuo\u2010Ching","Jian, Peng","Taylor, Adam","Her, Zhisheng","Herring, Belinda L.","Chow, Angela","Leo, Yee\u2010Sin","Hickey, Michael J.","Morand, Eric F.","Ng, Lisa F.
