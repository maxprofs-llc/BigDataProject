As a result, it is important to examine more integrative mechanisms that might link relationships across diverse physical health outcomes. In this study, we examine associations between relationships and telomeres that predict general disease risk. These questions are pursued in the context of a more comprehensive model of relationships that highlights the importance of jointly considering positive and negative aspects of social ties.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f610005925","authors":["Bert N.
