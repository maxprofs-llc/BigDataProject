Ketamine has been implicated in several case reports as a successful agent for treating RSE given that it blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which is overexpressed in prolonged status epilepticus.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005728","authors":["Diana Esaian","Danielle Joset","Candace Lazarovits","Patricia C.
