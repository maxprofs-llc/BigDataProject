The study focuses on the Multicultural Health Brokers practice, which offers an innovative approach to health promotion outreach and community development addressing broad social determinants of health. This article offers new evidence of both the role of community health worker interventions in Canada and community health workers as an invisible health and human services workforce. It also discusses the Multicultural Health Brokers contribution both to the \"new public health\" vision in Canada and to a practice that fosters feminist urban citizenship.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059f5","doi":"10.1097\/jac.0b013e3182a5480f","first_seen_on":"2013-10-10T02:57:34+00:00","issns":["0148-9917"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Ambulatory Care Management","last_mentioned_on":1389667907,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ambulatorycaremanagement\/Abstract\/2013\/10000\/Community_Health_Workers_in_Canada__Innovative.8.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ambulatorycaremanagement\/Fulltext\/2013\/10000\/Community_Health_Workers_in_Canada__Innovative.8.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ambulatorycaremanagement\/2013\/10000\/Community_Health_Workers_in_Canada__Innovative.8.pdf","pmid":"24402073","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"305","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Community Health Workers in Canada: Innovative Approaches to Health Promotion Outreach and Community Development Among Immigrant and Refugee Populations","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/community-health-workers-canada-innovative-approaches-health-promotion-outreach-community-developmen"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4771101,"mean":5.7217804170968,"rank":2533729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1587677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4771101,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103278,"mean":7.9989573670809,"rank":51363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":37971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103278,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":1.5416408450704,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
