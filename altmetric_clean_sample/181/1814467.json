Photo: Lialis jicari","Functional microornamentation of Lialis (ProcRSocB)"],"citation":{"abstract":"The skin of geckos is covered with countless microscopic protuberances (spines). This surface structure causes low wettability to water. During evolution, representatives of the recent gekkotan clade Pygopodidae started slithering on the ground. This manner of locomotion affected limb reduction resulting in a snake-like body. Regarding abrasion and frictional properties, a surface covered with gekkotan spines is a topography that hampers the snake-like locomotion mode. Using scanning electron microscopy, we investigated the shed skins of two pygopodid lizards, Lialis jicari (Papua snake lizard) and Lialis burtonis (Burton's legless lizard), in order to show epidermal adaptations to limbless locomotion. Our data showed that Pygopodidae differ from their relatives not only anatomically, but also in their epidermal microstructure. Scales of L. jicari have five different structural patterns on various body regions. Ventral scales have nanoridges, similar to those found on the ventralia of snakes. Surfaces of scales covering the jaw bones, have flattened spine-like microstructures that might be an adaptation to reduce abrasion. Dorsal scales have oblong microscopic bulges covered with nanoridges. Spines cover the undersides and the interstices of scales over the entire body of both species and in L. jicari also the top of dorsal head scales. Our measurements of surface wettability (surface free energy) show superhydrophobic properties of the spiny surfaces in comparison with the other microstructural patterns of other body parts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","authors":["M.
