Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were induced along the adipogenic lineage. LM chain mRNA and protein levels were followed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunoprecipitation. MSCs produced low levels of LM mRNAs but were not surrounded by BM in IF and TEM imaging. LM-\u03b14, LM-\u03b21, and LM-\u03b31 mRNAs increased during adipogenesis 3.9-, 5.8-, and 2.8-fold by day 28. LM-411 was immunoprecipitated from the ECM of the differentiated cells. Immunostaining suggested deposition of LM-411 and some LM-421. BM build-up was probably organized in part by integrin (Int) \u03b16\u03b21. At day 28, TEM images revealed BM-like structures around fat droplet-containing cells. The first signs of BM formation and Int \u03b16\u03b21 were seen using IF imaging at day 14. Laminin-411 and Int \u03b16\u03b21 were expressed in vivo in mature human subcutaneous fat tissue. Undifferentiated human MSCs did not organize LM subunits into BM, whereas LM-411 and some LM-421 are precipitated in the BM around adipocytes. This is the first demonstration of LM-411 precipitation during hMSC adipogenesis around adipocytes as a structural scaffold and Int-regulated signaling element.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c0","authors":["Ariel Noro","Tarvo Sillat","Ismo Virtanen","Sulev Ingerpuu","Nils B\u00e4ck","Yrj\u00f6 T Konttinen","Matti Korhonen"],"doi":"10.1369\/0022155413502055","first_seen_on":"2013-10-09T10:45:55+00:00","issns":["1551-5044"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1381317073,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23900596?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23900596","pubdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["histocytochemistry"],"title":"Laminin Production and Basement Membrane Deposition by Mesenchymal Stem Cells upon Adipogenic Differentiation.","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laminin-production-basement-membrane-deposition-mesenchymal-stem-cells-upon-adipogenic-differentiati"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2276091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2204458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100722,"mean":7.8034180756746,"rank":49137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":50691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100722,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":394,"mean":2.1344325699746,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":178,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":394,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.1452,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
