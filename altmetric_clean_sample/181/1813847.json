During pregnancy there is much debate as to whether to continue or cease these medications. The possibility of adverse effects is of concern to clinicians and the women. This study used a case study methodology to identify the outcomes for 10 babies of women with a history of serious mental illness. The results provide further evidence in regard to women and the use of antipsychotic medications throughout pregnancy and during the first year after birth. Separation of mother and baby occurred in five of the 10 babies. This study identifies the neonatal complications for these vulnerable babies as not outside the norm for births in Australia. The high rate of mother-baby separation is of great concern and needs further longitudinal studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ee5","authors":["McCauley, K.
