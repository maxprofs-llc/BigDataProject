Examination revealed a sensory level at D 10 dermatome and grade two power in both the lower limbs with absent reflexes. Examination of spine revealed a knuckle at T8 level, which was tender on palpation. MRI spine showed erosion of D11-12 and L1 in vertebral bodies with destruction of left pedicles, transverse processes and lamina, and a prominent psoas abscess. Post gadolinium study revealed ring-enhancing lesions in the D11-12 and L1 vertebrae as well as the dural sac. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and bone biopsy demonstrated a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, large cell high-grade) of the spine (primary), which as per age is the youngest case of NHL ever reported in literature with multiple vertebral involvement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f8d","authors":["Dar"],"doi":"10.4103\/0973-1482.119306","first_seen_on":"2013-10-08T23:30:40+00:00","issns":["0973-1482"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Cancer Research & Therapeutics","last_mentioned_on":1381275014,"links":["http:\/\/www.cancerjournal.net\/article.asp?issn=0973-1482;year=2013;volume=9;issue=3;spage=487;epage=489;aulast=Dar"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cancerjournal.net\/article.asp?issn=0973-1482;year=2013;volume=9;issue=3;spage=487;epage=489;aulast=Dar;type=2","pmid":"24125988","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Primary bone lymphoma with multiple vertebral involvement","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/primary-bone-lymphoma-multiple-vertebral-involvement"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100616,"mean":7.8139949510512,"rank":68894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":20886,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100616,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183,"mean":1.1021428571429,"rank":89,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.51923076923077,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
