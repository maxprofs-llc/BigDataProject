The mol-ecule lies on a crystallographic inversion centre so that the asymmetric unit contains half of the mol-ecule. The mol-ecule was prepared by thio-nation of N,N'-di-benzyl-pyromellitic di-imide with Lawesson's reagent and has an S-shaped conformation similar to other compounds of this type. The phenyl groups are tilted by 72.69\u2005(8)\u00b0 with respect to the plane of the central arene ring. In the crystal, mol-ecules are connected by C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions and weak short S\u22efS contacts, forming supra-molecular layers extending paralled to the ab plane. The crystal studied was found to be non-merohedrally twinned, with the minor component being 0.113\u2005(3).","authors":["Im, H.","Park, H.","Kim, T.H.","Woo, C.H.","Im, H.","Park, H.","Kim, T.H.","Woo, C.H.","IUCr"],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989017012154","first_seen_on":"2017-08-26T00:08:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"Pt 9","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1503705606,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989017012154"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2017\/09\/00\/hg5493\/hg5493.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5588585","pmid":"28932479","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","title":"Crystal structure of 2,6-di\u00adbenzyl\u00adpyrrolo\u00ad[3,4-f]iso\u00adindole-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetra\u00adthione","type":"article","volume":"73"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/901232752309268481","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24321832],"posted_on":"2017-08-26T00:00:06+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"901232752309268481"}]}}
