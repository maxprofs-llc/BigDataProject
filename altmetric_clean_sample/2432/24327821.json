High-quality STIC volume data are needed for an antenatal anatomic survey to diagnose congenital heart disease. We aimed to clarify the causes of unsuccessful STIC volume data acquisition and describe a more accurate, efficient STIC examination.\nThis cross-sectional study of 1124 women with fetuses assessed risk factors for unsuccessful acquisition of STIC volume data. Logistic regression analysis quantified the relation between unsuccessful acquisition and clinical variables, including maternal body mass index (BMI), shadowing artifacts due to unexpected fetal limb movement (SAU), estimated fetal weight (EFW), gestational age (GA), use of volume rendering images in four-dimensional ultrasonography (4D-US), fetal heart rate (FHR), maternal age, anterior placenta, and prior lower abdominal surgery.\nSTIC volume data acquisition was unsuccessful in 210 of 1124 (18.6%) cases. SAU, BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a028\u00a0kg\/m(2), not using volume rendering images in 4D-US, EFW\u00a0\u2265\u00a01300\u00a0g, and anterior placenta were independent risk factors for unsuccessful STIC data acquisition.\nAvoiding SAU was the most important factor for accurate, efficient STIC evaluations for diagnosing congenital heart disease antenatally. The risk was not explained by lack of sonographer proficiency. Volume rendering images in 4D-US is a promising approach to successful acquisition of STIC volume data.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ead","authors":["Eisuke Inubashiri","Sayuri Tatedo","Naomi Nishiyama","Hiina Minami","Yukio Watanabe","Noriyuki Akutagawa","Katumaru Kuroki","Masaki Sugawara","Nobuhiko Maeda","Keiji Haseyama"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10396-017-0818-1","first_seen_on":"2017-08-26T04:00:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1346-4523","1613-2254"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Ultrasonics","last_mentioned_on":1503720011,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28836088?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28836088","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Feasibility assessment for successfully visualizing the fetal heart utilizing spatiotemporal image correlation","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":7284473,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169794,"mean":12.650415105452,"rank":138979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169794,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.5452380952381,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.875,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ahirotat\/statuses\/901293169341378560","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24327821],"posted_on":"2017-08-26T04:00:11+00:00","author":{"name":"A.","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/660765524847030272\/aaH8dAjY_normal.jpg","description":"Fetal and Neonatal cardiology","id_on_source":"ahirotat","tweeter_id":"1888684922","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":509},"tweet_id":"901293169341378560"}]}}
