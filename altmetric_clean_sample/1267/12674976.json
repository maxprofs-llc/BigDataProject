We show that TaAs transforms from an ambient I4_{1}md phase (t-TaAs) to a high-pressure hexagonal P-6m2\u2009 (h-TaAs) phase at 14\u00a0GPa, along with changes of the electronic state from containing 24 Weyl nodes distributed at two energy levels to possessing 12 Weyl nodes at an isoenergy level, which substantially reduces the interference between the surface and bulk states. The new pressure-induced phase can be reserved upon releasing pressure to ambient condition, which allows one to study the exotic behavior of a single set of Weyl fermions, such as the interplay between surface states and other properties.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Yonghui Zhou","Pengchao Lu","Yongping Du","Xiangde Zhu","Ganghua Zhang","Ranran Zhang","Dexi Shao","Xuliang Chen","Xuefei Wang","Mingliang Tian","Jian Sun","Xiangang Wan","Zhaorong Yang","Wenge Yang","Yuheng Zhang","Dingyu Xing"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.117.146402","first_seen_on":"2016-10-17T08:40:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1079-7114","0031-9007"],"issue":"14","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1476690755,"links":["http:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.117.146402"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.117.146402","pmid":"27740840","pubdate":"2016-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Pressure-Induced New Topological Weyl Semimetal Phase in TaAs","type":"article","volume":"117","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pressureinduced-new-topological-weyl-semimetal-phase-taas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7554544,"mean":6.5226894405088,"rank":1033572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6454182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7554544,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236440,"mean":12.528277441539,"rank":50009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":183045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236440,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15533,"mean":10.687475791913,"rank":4226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":10863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15533,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":427,"mean":20.417028169014,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":272,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":427,"percentile":63}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
