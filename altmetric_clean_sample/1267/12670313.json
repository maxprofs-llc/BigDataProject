Cell biology is teaching us much about the developmental stages associated with infection, especially the haustorium, which is a site of intimate interaction and molecular exchange between pathogen and host. Recent observations suggest a role for the plant endocytic cycle in specific recruitment of host proteins to the Extra-Haustorial Membrane, emphasising the unique nature of this membrane compartment. In addition, there has been a strong focus on the activities of RXLR effectors, which are delivered into plant cells to modulate and manipulate host processes. RXLR effectors interact directly with diverse plant proteins at a range of subcellular locations to promote disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a5","authors":["Whisson, Stephen C","Boevink, Petra C","Wang, Shumei","Birch, Paul Rj"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mib.2016.09.002","endpage":"135","first_seen_on":"2016-10-17T03:37:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0364","13695274"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1488873300,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1369527416301345"],"pmid":"27723513","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"127","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"The cell biology of late blight disease","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-biology-late-blight-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8320311,"mean":7.0122256031246,"rank":3940996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4194489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8320311,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248791,"mean":12.737948784115,"rank":117576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":124062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248791,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":858,"mean":5.4941446907818,"rank":587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":858,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":3.7004848484848,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
