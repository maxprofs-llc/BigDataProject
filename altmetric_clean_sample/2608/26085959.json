The endocuff is a polymer sleeve cap that is connected to the tip of the colonoscope in order to improve visualization of the mucosa during colonoscopy. The aim of the study was to compare adenoma detection rates (ADR) of endocuff-assisted colonoscopy and conventional colonoscopy. Patients and methods\u2002Patients 50\u00a0years or older were randomized into two groups: an endocuff-assisted colonoscopy group and a conventional colonoscopy group without the endocuff. Results\u2002A total of 337 patients were included: 174 in the endocuff group and 163 in the conventional group. The median age was 61\u00a0years (interquartile range 55\u200a-\u200a70\u00a0years), and 74\u200a% were women. The ADR was higher in the endocuff group than in the conventional group (22.4\u200a% vs. 13.5\u200a%; P\u200a=\u200a0.02). The mean number of adenomas was 0.30 (SD 0.25) in the endocuff group and 0.21 (SD 0.26) in the conventional group (P\u00a0\u200a=\u200a0.02). The rate of ileal intubation was lower in the endocuff group (73\u200a% vs. 87\u200a%; P\u200a<\u200a0.001). No serious adverse events occurred with the use of the endocuff. Conclusions\u2002Endocuff colonoscopy achieved a greater ADR than conventional colonoscopy.Trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NTC02387593).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027c5","authors":["Coty Gonz\u00e1lez-Fern\u00e1ndez","David Garc\u00eda-Rangel","Nancy Aguilar-Olivos","Rafael Barreto-Z\u00fa\u00f1iga","Adriana Romano-Munive","Guido Grajales-Figueroa","Luis Zamora-Nava","F\u00e9lix T\u00e9llez-Avila"],"doi":"10.1055\/s-0043-117879","first_seen_on":"2017-09-18T11:04:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0013-726X","1438-8812"],"journal":"Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1505751401,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28898920?dopt=Abstract&utm_content=buffer76429&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"28898920","pubdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging"],"title":"Higher adenoma detection rate with the endocuff: a randomized trial","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/higher-adenoma-detection-rate-endocuff-randomized-controlled-trial-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430718,"mean":7.0909734033215,"rank":6094274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2034062,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430718,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110740,"mean":11.821090654602,"rank":71317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":32749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110740,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1295,"mean":2.0372194744977,"rank":526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":701,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1295,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.0583333333333,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/aegastro\/statuses\/909734769973432320","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26085959],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T11:04:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Aegastro","url":"http:\/\/www.aegastro.es","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/806817450926948352\/jiFjpOQn_normal.jpg","description":"Investigaci\u00f3n colaborativa multic\u00e9ntrica y formaci\u00f3n.
