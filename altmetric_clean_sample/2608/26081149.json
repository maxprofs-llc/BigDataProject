Subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain pre- and postoperatively to determine the severity of brain injury and total and regional brain volumes by the use of automated morphometry. Comparisons were made by cardiac lesion and injury status.\nA total of 79 subjects were included (49, TGA; 30, HLHS). Subjects with HLHS had more postoperative brain injury (55.6% vs 30.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) and more severe brain injury (moderate-to-severe white matter [WM] injury, P\u00a0=\u00a0.01). Total and regional perioperative brain growth was not different by brain injury status (either pre- or postoperative). However, subjects with moderate-to-severe WM injury had a slower rate of brain growth in WM and gray matter compared with those with no injury. Subjects with HLHS had a slower rate of growth globally\u00a0and in WM and deep gray matter as compared with TGA (total brain volume: 12\u00a0cm(3)\/wk vs 7\u00a0cm(3); WM: 2.1\u00a0cm(3)\/wk vs 0.6\u00a0cm(3); deep gray matter: 1.5\u00a0cm(3)\/wk vs 0.7\u00a0cm(3); P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), after we adjusted for gestational age at scan and the presence of brain injury. This difference remained after excluding subjects with moderate-to-severe WM injury.\nNeonates with HLHS have a slower rate of global and regional brain growth compared with TGA, likely related to inherent physiologic differences postoperatively. These findings demonstrate the complex interplay between cardiac lesion, brain injury, and brain growth.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007efa","authors":["Shabnam Peyvandi","Hosung Kim","Joanne Lau","A.
