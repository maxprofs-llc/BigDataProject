It crystallized with two independent mol-ecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit. The compound is composed of a hexhydro-indazole ring system (viz. a five-membered di-hydro-pyrazole ring fused to a cyclo-hexyl ring) with a thia-zole-4-one ring system attached to one of the pyrazole N atoms (at position 2). The overall geometry of the two mol-ecules differs slightly, with the mean planes of the pyrazole and thia-zole rings being inclined to one another by 10.4\u2005(1)\u00b0 in mol-ecule A and 0.9\u2005(1)\u00b0 in mol-ecule B. In the crystal, the A and B mol-ecules are linked via C-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, forming slabs parallel to the ab plane. There are C-H\u22ef\u03c0 inter-actions present within the layers, and between the layers, so forming a three-dimensional structure.","authors":["Ousidi, A.N.'","Ousidi, A.N.'","Itto, M.Y.A.","Auhmani, A.","Riahi, A.","Daran, J.-C.","Abdelwahed, A."],"doi":"10.1107\/s2056989016002498","endpage":"336","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T01:00:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2056-9890"],"issue":"3","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section E: Crystallographic Communications","last_mentioned_on":1455757206,"links":["http:\/\/scripts.iucr.org\/cgi-bin\/paper?S2056989016002498"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.iucr.org\/e\/issues\/2016\/03\/00\/su5277\/su5277.pdf","pmid":"27006801","pubdate":"2016-02-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"International Union of Crystallography","startpage":"334","title":"Crystal structure of 2-[(3aS,6R)-3,3,6-trimethyl-3,3a,4,5,6,7-hexa\u00adhydro-2H-indazol-2-yl]thia\u00adzol-4(5H)-one","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crystal-structure-23as6r336trimethyl33a4567hexahydro2hindazol2ylthiazol45hone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ActaCrystE\/statuses\/700122586068475904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5627147],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T01:00:06+00:00","author":{"id_on_source":"ActaCrystE","tweeter_id":"587565184","geo":{"lt":53.1905,"ln":-2.89189,"country":"GB"}},"tweet_id":"700122586068475904"}]}}
