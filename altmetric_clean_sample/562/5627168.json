In OCT imaging, the presence of lamellar macular hole was defined according to the following findings: presence of irregular foveal contour, separation of the layers of the neurosensory retina, and the absence of full thickness macular defect. Mean outcome was the morphological and functional characterization of different subtypes of macular hole.\nTwo different subtypes of lamellar macular hole were identified: tractional and degenerative. The first type, tractional, was diagnosed in 43 eyes, and was characterized by the schitic separation of neurosensory retina between outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers. It often presented with an intact ellipsoid layer and was associated with tractional epiretinal membranes and\/or vitreo-macular traction. The second type, degenerative, was diagnosed in 48 eyes, and its distinctive traits included the presence of intra-retinal cavitation that could affect all retinal layers. It was often associated with non-tractional epiretinal proliferation and a retinal \"bump\". Moreover, it often presented with early ellipsoidal zone defect and its pathogenesis, although chronic, and progressive remains poorly understood. Eleven eyes shared common features with both tractional and degenerative lamellar macular holes and were classified as mixed lesions.\nDegenerative and tractional lamellar macular holes may be two distinct clinical entities. A revision of the current concept of lamellar macular holes is needed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002205","authors":["Andrea Govetto","Yann Dacquay","Matt Farajzadeh","Eva Platner","Kyle Hirabayashi","Hamid Hosseini","Steven D.
