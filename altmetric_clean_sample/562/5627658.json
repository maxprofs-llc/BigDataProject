Bare SnO2 SMCs, as well as bare commercial SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs), show very high initial discharge capacity when used as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. However, during the following cycles most of the Li ions previously inserted cannot be extracted, resulting in considerable irreversibility. Porous SnO2 cubes have been proven to possess better electrochemical performance than the dense nanoparticles. After being encapsulated by carbon shell, the obtained yolk-shell SnO2 SMCs@C exhibits significantly enhanced reversibility for lithium-ions storage. The reversibility of the conversion between SnO2 and Sn, which is largely responsible for the enhanced capacity, has been discussed. The porous SnO2 SMCs@C shows much increased capacity and cycling stability, demonstrating that the porous SnO2 core is essential for better lithium-ion storage performance. The strategy introduced in this paper can be used as a versatile way to fabrication of various metal-oxide-based composites.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008951","authors":["Huang, Bin","Li, Xinhai","Pei, Yi","Li, Shuang","Cao, Xi","Mass\u00e9, Robert C.","Cao, Guozhong","Mass\u00e9, Robert C"],"doi":"10.1002\/smll.201503419","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T02:05:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1613-6829"],"issue":"14","journal":"Small","last_mentioned_on":1455757200,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201503419\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/smll.201503419"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/smll.201503419\/pdf","pmid":"26882498","pubdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["biomedicalengineering","nanotechnology"],"title":"Novel Carbon\u2010Encapsulated Porous SnO2 Anode for Lithium\u2010Ion Batteries with Much Improved Cyclic Stability","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-carbonencapsulated-porous-sno2-anode-lithiumion-batteries-much-improved-cyclic-stability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7211484,"mean":6.3513465940328,"rank":973829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6174807,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7211484,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283223,"mean":10.313839913566,"rank":54303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":225579,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283223,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1690,"mean":5.2052587329781,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":1373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1690,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":66,"mean":15.157476923077,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":50,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":66,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
