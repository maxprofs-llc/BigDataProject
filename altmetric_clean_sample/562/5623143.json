Data linkage was undertaken for 5836 Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohort study children participating both in the Bradford vision screening programme and the BiB Starting Schools Programme. 2025 children had complete data and were included in the multivariable analyses.\nVisual acuity was measured using a logMAR Crowded Test (higher scores=poorer visual acuity). Literacy measured by Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised (WRMT-R) subtest: letter identification (standardised).\nThe mean (SD) presenting visual acuity was 0.14 (0.09) logMAR (range 0.0-1.0). 9% of children had a presenting visual acuity worse than 0.2logMAR (failed vision screening), 4% worse than 0.3logMAR (poor visual acuity) and 2% worse than 0.4logMAR (visually impaired). Unadjusted analysis showed that the literacy score was associated with presenting visual acuity, reducing by 2.4 points for every 1 line (0.10logMAR) reduction in vision (95% CI -3.0 to -1.9). The association of presenting visual acuity with the literacy score remained significant after adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors reducing by 1.7 points (95% CI -2.2 to -1.1) for every 1 line reduction in vision.\nPrevalence of decreased visual acuity was high compared with other population-based studies. Decreased visual acuity at school entry is associated with reduced literacy. This may have important implications for the children's future educational, health and social outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Alison Bruce","Lesley Fairley","Bette Chambers","John Wright","Trevor A Sheldon","Bruce, Alison","Fairley, Lesley","Chambers, Bette","Wright, John","Sheldon, Trevor A"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2015-010434","first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T08:34:32+00:00","funders":["niehs","mrc","dohuk"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"2","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1480336667,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e010434.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=vK3YppNGRUKnk2t","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26883240?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e010434.abstract","http:\/\/m.bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e010434.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=vK3YppNGRUKnk2t?view=full&uritype=cgi&ijkey=vK3YppNGRUKnk2t&keytype=ref","http:\/\/m.bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e010434.full?keytype=ref&keytype=ref&ijkey=vK3YppNGRUKnk2t?viewfull&ijkey=vK3YppNGRUKnk2t&uritype=cgi"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/2\/e010434.full.pdf","pmid":"26883240","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e010434","title":"Impact of visual acuity on developing literacy at age 4\u20135\u2005years: a cohort-nested cross-sectional study","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-visual-acuity-developing-literacy-age-45years-cohortnested-crosssectional-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.15,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.15},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7820779,"mean":6.6320512728979,"rank":845387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":6974086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7820779,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287520,"mean":10.457508171634,"rank":45631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":241810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287520,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5437,"mean":16.932210448859,"rank":1542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":3892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5437,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":369,"mean":13.94902173913,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":369,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Student  > Ph.
