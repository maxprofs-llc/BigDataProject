Our aim was to determine the heritability of corneal ECD.\nCorneal ECD of 114 eyes (66 eyes of 33 monozygotic and 48 eyes of 24 dizygotic pairs; mean age 49.0 \u00b1 15.5 years) was investigated by Konan Noncon Robo NSP-9900 specular microscopy. Structural equation modeling (ACE model) was applied.\nEndothelial corneal cell density was highly heritable (82.0%, 95%CI, 70.0-92.0%), whereas the unique environmental contribution was 18.0% (95%CI, 8.0-29.0%). Shared environmental factors had no influence on the endothelial corneal cell density.\nIn this twin study, we established first that the density of the corneal endothelial cells is strongly heritable, which should stimulate future genetic studies to identify genes and pathways that are involved in determining ECD which might in turn lead to future treatments to prevent EC loss.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5303cf058f61000435f","authors":["Racz, Adel","Toth, Georgina Zsofia","Tarnoki, Adam Domonkos","Tarnoki, David Laszlo","Littvay, Levente","Suveges, Ildiko","Nagy, Zolt\u00e1n Zsolt","Nemeth, Janos"],"doi":"10.3109\/13816810.2015.1045524","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T01:28:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-5094","1381-6810"],"journal":"Ophthalmic Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1460946404,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26849379?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26849379"],"pmid":"26849379","pubdate":"2016-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical","ophthalmology"],"title":"The inheritance of corneal endothelial cell density","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":3690700,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3682918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285526,"mean":10.421175595832,"rank":142189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":132379,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285526,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":1.5063414634146,"rank":84,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":113,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":0.81875,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":68}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eyecenterllc\/statuses\/700129602400866304","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5627314],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T01:27:59+00:00","author":{"name":"Eye Center","url":"http:\/\/eyecenterllc.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/355341300\/apple-touch-icon_normal.png","description":"Ophthalmologists - Eye Physicians and Surgeons.
