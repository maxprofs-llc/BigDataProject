Patients with epilepsy of focal origin may have an excellent outcome following surgery that removes the source of seizures. Identification of the precise cortical region producing seizures is crucial to a good outcome; additionally, identification of eloquent cortical areas near the region to be resected is essential to prevent postoperative neurological deficit. A wide range of imaging techniques is valuable for imaging the epileptogenic zone, including high-resolution T1 MRI, T2 signal quantitation, MR spectroscopy, diffusion imaging, PET, SPECT and simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Eloquent cortex has in the past been mapped using highly invasive techniques; fMRI of motor and cognitive tasks holds great promise for future non-invasive mapping strategies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60f3cf058f610006d1b","authors":["Mark P Richardson"],"doi":"10.1093\/bmb\/65.1.179","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T22:57:52+00:00","issns":["0007-1420","1471-8391"],"journal":"British Medical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1447552663,"links":["http:\/\/bmb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/65\/1\/179.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/65\/1\/179.full.pdf","pmid":"12697625","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Epilepsy and surgical mapping","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epilepsy-surgical-mapping"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6569769,"mean":6.0903787716706,"rank":2261319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4259086,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6569769,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255379,"mean":10.788112633038,"rank":92290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":160912,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255379,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":387,"mean":5.5052953367876,"rank":225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":387,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":6.195,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
