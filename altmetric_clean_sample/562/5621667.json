The nano-sized POSS moiety can be conveniently modified on the periphery with a variety of functional groups to lead to hybrid materials with desired functions. In addition, suitable mono-functionalised POSS allows to be incorporated into polymers as side chains via various synthesis strategies to offer a wide class of functional polymeric materials with tunable physical properties dedicated for targeted applications. In this Focus Review, we aim to summarize the recent development on the chemistry and applications of POSS based molecules and polymers. Moreover, the properties as well as assembly behavior of the POSS based functional hybrid materials will be reviewed and the co-relationship of the hybrid materials performance with the intrinsic nature of the POSS unit will be addressed in this Focus Review.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Xu, Jianwei","Ye, Qun","Zhou, Hui"],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201501445","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T01:37:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X"],"issue":"9","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1458246888,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201501445?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26879136?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201501445"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201501445\/pdf","pmid":"26879136","pubdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Recent Advances of Cubic Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes Based Functional Materials: Synthesis, Properties and Applications","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cubic-polyhedral-oligomeric-silsesquioxane-based-functional-materials-synthesis-assembly-application"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7406294,"mean":6.4383957944913,"rank":3805796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2074352,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7406294,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284672,"mean":10.348738916152,"rank":153430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284672,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2192,"mean":1.3756166134185,"rank":396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":1646,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2192,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":1.2620689655172,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":89,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
