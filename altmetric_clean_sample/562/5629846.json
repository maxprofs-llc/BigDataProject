As C5a primed neutrophils play an important role in the development of AAV, we aimed to investigate that C5a induced neutrophils tissue factor (TF) expressing microparticles (MPs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) might promote hypercoagulability in AAV. [Methods] TF expressing MPs were measured by flow cytometry. TF expressing NETs were assessed by confocal microscopy. Thrombin-antithrombin complex levels were tested by ELISA. The effect of C5a in sera from AAV patients was proved through treating neutrophils with C5a receptor antagonist before incubating with sera from AAV patients with active disease. [Results] Treatment of C5a primed neutrophils with ANCA-positive IgG resulted in the release of TF bearing MPs and NETs. Neutrophils from healthy donors treated with sera from patients with active AAV released TF bearing MPs and NETs which were abolished with C5a receptor antagonist. TF implication in MP or NETs dependent thrombin generation was demonstrated by antibody neutralization studies. NETs with thrombin-generating capacity were demonstrated by DNase I. [Conclusion] C5a primed neutrophils produce TF expressing MPs and NETs after ANCAs stimulation, providing a novel mechanism for hypercoagulability in AAV. This article is protected by copyright.
