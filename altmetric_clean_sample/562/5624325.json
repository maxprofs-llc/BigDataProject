We included all adult and pediatric hospitalized patients who had received at least one dose of carbapenem. Data was collected from patients' medical records (hard copy and computerized data; CristalLink software). Compliance with guidelines was assessed by two infectious disease specialists. Assessment criteria included indication, antibiotic choice, dosage, and treatment duration.\nWe included 152 patients in the study (65.4% of men). Carbapenem prescription was appropriate for 76.3% of prescriptions. The use of carbapenems was considered appropriate for 73.9% of empirical prescriptions and for 77.8% of documented prescriptions. Non-compliance with guidelines was mainly due to prescriptions for community-acquired infections. Antibiotic de-escalation could not be initiated in 40.3% of patients and was only initiated in 51.7% of patients for whom it could be considered. Although the average treatment duration was 7.5 days, 23.7% of patients received carbapenems for more than 10 days.\nThese results highlight the need for a strong carbapenem stewardship program in our hospital.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f61000308a","authors":["Van Hollebeke, M","Chapuis, C","Bernard, S","Foroni, L","Stahl, J P","Bedouch, P","Pavese, P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.medmal.2015.10.009","first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T13:31:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1769-6690"],"journal":"Medecine & Maladies Infectieuses","last_mentioned_on":1455715869,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26874673?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26874673","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine","communicablediseases"],"title":"Compliance with carbapenem guidelines in a university hospital","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compliance-carbapenem-guidelines-university-hospital"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":5423678,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":993064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283663,"mean":10.295303699473,"rank":198251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":46003,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283663,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":2.330712195122,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.8863636363636,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ndm1bacteria\/statuses\/699949202831355904","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5624325],"posted_on":"2016-02-17T13:31:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Dave Roberts","url":"http:\/\/www.ndm1bacteria.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1294321879\/713px-EscherichiaColi_NIAID_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"ndm1bacteria","tweeter_id":"177368473","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":545},"tweet_id":"699949202831355904"}]}}
