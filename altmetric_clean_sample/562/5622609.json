Using three naturally occurring archival data sets in which students took exams on either red or green exam booklets, the results indicated that booklet color (red vs. green) did not affect exam performance. From a scientific perspective, the results suggest that color effects may be attenuated by factors that characterize high-stakes assessments, and from an applied perspective, they suggest that the choice of red vs. green exam booklets in higher education summative evaluations is likely not a concern.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033e7","authors":["Winfred Arthur Jr.","Inchul Cho","Gonzalo J.
