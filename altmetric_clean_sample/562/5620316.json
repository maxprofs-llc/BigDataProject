This qualitative study aimed to develop a framework of women's prenatal care experiences by comparing the experiences of women in individual and group prenatal care.\nWe conducted serial qualitative interviews with racially diverse low-income women receiving individual prenatal care (n = 14) or group prenatal care (n = 15) through pregnancy and the early postpartum period. We completed 42 second-trimester, 48 third-trimester, and 44 postpartum interviews. Using grounded theory, the semistructured interviews were coded for themes, and the themes were integrated into an explanatory framework of prenatal care functions and benefits.\nIndividual and group participants described similar benefits in 3 prenatal care functions: confirming health, preventing and monitoring medical complications, and building supportive provider relationships. For the fourth function, educating and preparing, group care participants experienced more benefits and different benefits. The benefits for group participants were enhanced by the supportive group environment. Group participants described greater positive influences on stress, confidence, knowledge, motivation, informed decision making, and health care engagement.\nWhereas pregnant women want to maximize their probability of having a healthy newborn, other prenatal care outcomes are also important: reducing pregnancy-related stress; developing confidence and knowledge for improving health; preparing for labor, birth, and newborn care; and having supportive relationships. Group prenatal care may be more effective in attaining these outcomes. Achieving these outcomes is increasingly relevant in health care systems prioritizing woman-centered care and improved birth outcomes. How to achieve them should be part of policy development and research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d6d","authors":["Heberlein, Emily C","Picklesimer, Amy H","Billings, Deborah L","Covington-Kolb, Sarah","Farber, Naomi","Frongillo, Edward A","Heberlein, Emily C.","Picklesimer, Amy H.","Billings, Deborah L.","Covington\u2010Kolb, Sarah","Frongillo, Edward A."],"doi":"10.1111\/jmwh.12379","first_seen_on":"2016-02-16T21:38:09+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1542-2011"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1461947498,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26878599","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/jmwh.12379","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26878599?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"26878599","pubdate":"2016-02-16T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","obstetrics"],"title":"Qualitative Comparison of Women's Perspectives on the Functions and Benefits of Group and Individual Prenatal Care","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/qualitative-comparison-womens-perspectives-functions-benefits-group-individual-prenatal-care"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7625034,"mean":6.5623772256419,"rank":1454572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6164864,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7625034,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287257,"mean":10.375801786559,"rank":69564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":217325,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287257,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":5.4128922155689,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":559,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.1136363636364,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
