Women were randomized to physical therapy (PT) for UI or osteoporosis education. The primary outcome measure was number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary, assessed at baseline, after treatment and at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures included the pad test and disease-specific quality of life and self-efficacy questionnaires assessed at the same timepoints.\nForty-eight women participated (24 per group). Two participants dropped out of each group and one participant was deceased before 3-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken. At 3 months and 1 year, there was a statistically significant difference in the number of leakage episodes on the 7-day bladder diary (3 mo: P\u200a=\u200a0.04; 1 y: P\u200a=\u200a0.01) in favor of the PT group. The effect size was 0.34 at 1 year. There were no harms reported.\nAfter a 12-week course of PT once per week for UI, PT group participants had a 75% reduction in weekly median number of leakage episodes, whereas the control group's condition had no improvement. At 1 year, the PT group participants maintained this improvement, whereas the control group's incontinence worsened.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b2c","authors":["Sran, Meena","Mercier, Joanie","Wilson, Penny","Lieblich, Pat","Dumoulin, Chantale"],"doi":"10.1097\/gme.0000000000000594","first_seen_on":"2016-02-18T07:25:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1072-3714","1530-0374"],"issue":"3","journal":"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","last_mentioned_on":1473605320,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/9000\/00000\/Physical_therapy_for_urinary_incontinence_in.98057.pdf?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Physical_therapy_for_urinary_incontinence_in.98057.aspx","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/GME.0000000000000594","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26886884","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26886884\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/26886884\/?platform=hootsuite","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Citation\/2016\/03000\/Physical_therapy_for_urinary_incontinence_in.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/9000\/00000\/Physical_therapy_for_urinary_incontinence_in.98057.pdf","pmid":"26886884","pubdate":"2016-02-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["gynecology"],"title":"Physical therapy for urinary incontinence in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or low bone density:  a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/menopausejournal\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Physical_therapy_for_urinary_incontinence_in.98057.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/physical-therapy-urinary-incontinence-postmenopausal-women-osteoporosis-low-bone-density"},"altmetric_score":{"score":27.8,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":27.8},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":324412,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":8035487,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":96},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":290162,"mean":10.698345325526,"rank":17831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":272309,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":290162,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1051,"mean":19.117274285714,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":925,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1051,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":13.869583333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":9,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":9,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":6,"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WKWomensHealth\/statuses\/700219446200111104","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5628694],"posted_on":"2016-02-18T07:25:00+00:00","author":{"name":"WK WomensHealth","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/562714651104788480\/5l0_gER9_normal.jpeg","description":"Updates from Wolters Kluwer's Women's Health journals and other OB\/GYN news.
