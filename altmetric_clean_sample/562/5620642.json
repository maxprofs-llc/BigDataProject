It is shown that no physical property can be identified that carries significantly less information than others and that the information overlap between different properties and different length scales along the sequence is essentially zero. These observations suggest that bioinformatic models based on arbitrarily selected sets of physical properties are inherently deficient.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Harold A.
