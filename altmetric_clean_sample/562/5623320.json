Using data from 11 European countries for males born between 1935 and 1956, we show that firstborns enjoy on average a 13.7 % premium in their entry wage compared with later-borns. This advantage, however, is short-lived and disappears 10 years after labor market entry. Although firstborns start with a better job, partially because of their higher education, later-borns quickly catch up by switching earlier and more frequently to better-paying jobs. We argue that a key factor driving our findings is that later-borns have lower risk aversion than firstborns.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026d7","authors":["Marco Bertoni","Giorgio Brunello"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13524-016-0454-1","first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T09:36:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1533-7790"],"journal":"Demography","last_mentioned_on":1461007320,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs13524-016-0454-1","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s13524-016-0454-1?wt_mc=alerts.TOCjournals"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs13524-016-0454-1.pdf","pmid":"26884377","pubdate":"2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Demography","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Later-borns Don\u2019t Give Up: The Temporary Effects of Birth Order on European Earnings","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/laterborns-dont-give-up-temporary-effects-birth-order-european-earnings"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7719043,"mean":6.6221385425732,"rank":1272437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":6443134,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7719043,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":287135,"mean":10.446562127787,"rank":62935,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":223962,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":287135,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1033,"mean":10.397740310078,"rank":395,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1033,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":32.482,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":7,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
