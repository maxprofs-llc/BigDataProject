The electropolymerization process was carried out under a constant deposition potential and applied to the corresponding aqueous electrolyte containing aniline and MOF particles. The employment of MOFs with their large and small cages and 3-D structures in synthesizing a nanocomposite was assumed to be efficient constitutes to induce more non-smooth and porous structures, approved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Three different MOFs were incorporated to synthesize the desired nanocomposites and the preliminary experiments showed that all of them, particularly the one containing MOF2, have higher extraction performances in compared with PANI. The applicability of the new fiber coating was examined by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) of some chlorobenzenes (CBs) from aqueous samples. Influencing parameters on the synthesize and extraction processes including the electrodeposition voltage and its duration time, the weight ratio of PANI and MOF, the ionic strength, desorption temperature and time, and extraction time and temperature were optimized. The developed method was validated by analyzing the spiked distilled water and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Under optimum condition, the relative standard deviation (RSD%) values for a double distilled water spiked with the selected CBs at 20ngL(-1) were 5-8% (n=3) and the detection limits were below 0.2ngL(-1). The linear dynamic range (LDR) of the method was in the concentration range of 0.5-1000ngL(-1) (R(2)>0.9994). The fiber-to-fiber reproducibility was found to be in the range of 4-7%. Eventually, various real-water samples were analyzed by the MOF\/PANI-based HS-SPME and GC-MS and the relative recovery values were found to be in the range of 92-98%.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf6","authors":["Bagheri, Habib","Javanmardi, Hasan","Abbasi, Alireza","Banihashemi, Solmaz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.chroma.2015.12.077","first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T15:45:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-3778","00219673"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography A","last_mentioned_on":1457482932,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0021967315018750"],"pmid":"26792446","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"A metal organic framework-polyaniline nanocomposite as a fiber coating for solid phase microextraction ","type":"article","volume":"1431","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metal-organic-frameworkpolyaniline-nanocomposite-fiber-coating-solid-phase-microextraction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7372759,"mean":6.4055135958582,"rank":3783135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2066755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7372759,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":284353,"mean":10.329145052611,"rank":153046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":284353,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2816,"mean":2.2479104795737,"rank":1290,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2816,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":6.838,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
