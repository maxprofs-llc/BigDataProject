We have developed osmotic pumps for this purpose. These pumps, 1- and 2-week duration implants for animal studies, and 12- and 24-hour forms for oral and rectal administration in clinical studies, provide precise, accurate control over rate and duration of systemic or local drug delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023e8","authors":["Eckenhoff, B","Yum, S I"],"first_seen_on":"2016-02-17T23:35:41+00:00","issns":["0142-9612"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biomaterials","last_mentioned_on":1455752126,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7248427"],"pmid":"7248427","pubdate":"1981-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"The osmotic pump: novel research tool for optimizing drug regimens","type":"article","volume":"2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/osmotic-pump-novel-research-tool-optimizing-drug-regimens"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7206148,"mean":6.3472117046704,"rank":1710517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":4591829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7206148,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283663,"mean":10.295252229766,"rank":87138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":190871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283663,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2144,"mean":5.4271488567429,"rank":426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1532,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2144,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":3.8305569620253,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Osmotic controlled-release oral delivery system","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=705518866#altmetric_citation_740ba6a7-2b23-43d0-8a6e-6c332414725c","license":"public","citation_ids":[5626880],"posted_on":"2016-02-17T23:35:26+00:00","summary":"OROS (Osmotic Release Oral System) is an advanced controlled release oral drug delivery system in the form of a rigid tablet with a semi-permeable outer membrane and one or more small laser drilled holes in it.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=8031252","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Garzfoth","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Garzfoth"}}]}}
