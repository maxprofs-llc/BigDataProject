The aim of the study was to assess the impact of 3D in bariatric surgery.\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted. All our patients who underwent bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or gastric bypass (GB)) between 2013 and 2016 were included. We compared 3D laparoscopy cohort and 2D laparoscopy cohort. Variables are as follows: age, sex, DM, hypertension, surgeon experience, and type of intervention. Comparisons of operative time, hospital stay, conversion, complications, reoperation, and exitus are completed.\nThree hundred twelve consecutive patients were included. 56.9% of patients underwent GB and 43.1% SG. Global complications were 3.2% (fistula 2.5%, hemoperitoneum 0.3%, others 0.4%). One hundred four procedures were performed in the 3D cohort and 208 in the 2D cohort. The 2D cohort and 3D cohort were similar regarding the following: percentage of GB vs SG, age, gender, learning curve, diabetes mellitus 2, hypertension, and sleep apnea. The operating time and hospital stay were significantly reduced in the 3D cohort (144.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058.07 vs 172.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076.11\u00a0min and 5.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6 vs 7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2\u00a0days. It was the same when we stratified the sample by type of surgery or experience of the surgeon. Complications were reduced in the 3D cohort in the surgeries performed by novice surgeons (10.2 vs 1.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034).\nThe use of 3D laparoscopy in bariatric surgery in our center has helped reducing the operating time and hospital stay, and improving the safety of the surgery, either in GB or SG, being equally favorable in novice or more experienced surgeons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f610008357","authors":["Esther Mari\u00f1o Padin","Raquel S\u00e1nchez Santos","Sonia Gonz\u00e1lez Fern\u00e1ndez","Antonia Brox Jimenez","Sergio Estevez Fern\u00e1ndez","Ester Carrera Dacosta","Agata Rial Duran","Maria Artime Rial","Ivan Dominguez Sanchez"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11695-017-2687-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T21:08:51+00:00","issns":["0960-8923","1708-0428"],"journal":"Obesity Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1506440046,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s11695-017-2687-5"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs11695-017-2687-5.pdf","pmid":"28456885","pubdate":"2017-04-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["metabolism","generalsurgery"],"title":"Impact of Three-Dimensional Laparoscopy in a Bariatric Surgery Program: Influence in the Learning Curve","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-threedimensional-laparoscopy-bariatric-surgery-program-influence-learning-curve"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.55,"score_history":{"1y":4.55,"6m":4.55,"3m":4.55,"1m":4.55,"1w":1.7,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":1777892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6676521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116326,"mean":11.518812705781,"rank":28539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":87548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116326,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1867,"mean":3.3688381564845,"rank":242,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":1622,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1867,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":1.5375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":3,"MX":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rsansan1\/statuses\/912423630558171136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26566124],"posted_on":"2017-09-25T21:08:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Rsanchezsantos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/483977368827363329\/I1eKydz1_normal.jpeg","description":"Cirujana de obesidad y patologia esofagogastrica en Pontevedra.
