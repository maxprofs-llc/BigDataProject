The isolate was identified as Paracoccus sp. according to its physiological characteristics, biochemical tests, and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. In liquid culture, 86.4% of 50\u00a0mg\/L metribuzin was removed by strain QCT6 after incubation for 7 days. The product of metribuzin degradation by QCT6 was identified as deamino-metribuzin, which has reduced phytotoxicity on the growth of maize. After being marked with the gfp gene, the colonization and distribution of gfp-tagged QCT6 were directly observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The QCT6 strain showed good colonization ability on maize roots and was maintained for at least 20 days in rhizosphere soil. After root irrigation with gfp-tagged QCT6, 75.7% of 15\u00a0mg\/L metribuzin was removed from the maize rhizosphere soil. This metribuzin-degrading strain QCT6 has strong potential applications for in situ bioremediation of soil contaminated with metribuzin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269a","authors":["Xing Huang","Hao Zhang","Feng Chen","Man Song"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00284-017-1360-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T19:31:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0343-8651","1432-0991"],"journal":"Current Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1506344340,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28940107"],"pmid":"28940107","pubdate":"2017-09-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Colonization of Paracoccus sp.
