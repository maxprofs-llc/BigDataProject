Muscle weakness of finger grip has been reported as a reversible side-effect of this new treatment. The objective of this work was to measure muscular side-effects after treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin. As botulinum toxin has been used in the treatment of pain, we studied whether the toxin might influence afferent thin-fibre function by measuring temperature perception thresholds. Thirty-seven patients treated with botulinum toxin (Botox, Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA, USA) showed a decrease in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) for both abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) compared with pre-injection values on average by 64 and 36%, respectively, at 3 weeks which returned nearly to normal at 37 weeks. Muscle power for both finger abduction and finger opposition decreased to a lesser extent. Repetitive nerve stimulation and single fibre electromyography (EMG) showed a disturbed neuromuscular transmission. Thus, despite careful technique with small doses of botulinum toxin injected intradermally, the toxin diffuses to underlying muscles. With regard to the present results, one should be careful in using higher doses of Botox than 0.8 mU\/cm(2) in the palmar skin above intrinsic muscles. No influence on thin-fibre function was seen.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002840","authors":["Swartling, C","F\u00e4rnstrand, C","Abt, G","St\u00e5lberg, E","Naver, H"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T17:42:11+00:00","issns":["1351-5101"],"issue":"5","journal":"European Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1506164974,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=11554908&dopt=abstractplus"],"pmid":"11554908","pubdate":"2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Side-effects of intradermal injections of botulinum A toxin in the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis: a neurophysiological study.","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sideeffects-intradermal-injections-botulinum-toxin-treatment-palmar-hyperhidrosis-neurophysiological"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":7304702,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112196,"mean":11.562226070681,"rank":91366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112196,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1704,"mean":4.9713846153846,"rank":1509,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1704,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":3.8155272727273,"rank":52,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
