Immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly improve treatment results in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, the role of T-lymphocytes in early NSCLC has not been sufficiently elucidated. The aim of this study was to characterize peripheral blood T cells expressing several selected surface antigens (CD4, CD8, CD25, CD28, PD-1, CTLA-4) and transcription factors (T-bet, ROR-yt, Fox-P3, GATA-3) in this patient population. The study group (LC) consisted of 80 treatment-na\u00efve patients with T1\/2aN0M0 NSCLC and was compared with 40 cancer-free patients matched for non-oncological diseases and demographic parameters (CG). Significantly higher counts of CTLA-4+cells (in both CD4+and CD8+subtypes), a lower proportion of PD-1 expressing cells and a significantly higher percentage of Fox-P3+CD4+cells were found in the LC group. The high proportion of CD4+PD-1+cells significantly correlated with poor outcomes in LC group, while low CD4\/CD8 ratio predicted a better prognosis. Based on our results it seems that NSCLC even at early stages of development initiate changes in the proportions of T cells that may have a significant impact on the clinical outcome.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c9","authors":["Jacek Rutkowski","Marta Cyman","Tomasz \u015alebioda","Kamila Bemben","Aleksandra Rutkowska","Marcin Grucha\u0142a","Zbigniew Kmie\u0107","Agnieszka Pliszka","Renata Zaucha"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cellimm.2017.09.007","first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T18:42:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["00088749","1090-2163"],"journal":"Cellular Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1506299120,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0008874917301430"],"pmid":"28939130","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Evaluation of peripheral blood T lymphocyte surface activation markers and transcription factors in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-peripheral-blood-t-lymphocyte-surface-activation-markers-transcription-factors-patients-e"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457413,"mean":7.1057140359167,"rank":7307594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457413,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113443,"mean":11.556585374024,"rank":92301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113443,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":554,"mean":2.1266582278481,"rank":460,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":554,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.66666666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"reddit":[{"title":"Evaluation of peripheral blood T lymphocyte surface activation markers and transcription factors in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc\/comments\/728zis\/evaluation_of_peripheral_blood_t_lymphocyte\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[26562276],"posted_on":"2017-09-25T00:25:20+00:00","author":{"name":"montaukwhaler","url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nsclc","id_on_source":"nsclc","followers":1,"subreddit":"non small cell lung cancer"}}]}}
