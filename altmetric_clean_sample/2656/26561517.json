The target chemicals were oxidation products of Adamsite (DM[ox]), Clark I (DA[ox]), and triphenylarsine (TPA[ox]). Method was validated within the concentration range of 1-5 ng\/g, 0.2-5 ng\/g and 0.2-5 ng\/g for DM[ox], DA[ox] and TPA[ox], respectively. The method was linear, precise and accurate. Limits of quantification (LOQ) were 2.0, 1.3 and 2.1 ng\/g for DM[ox], DA[ox] and TPA[ox], respectively. A total of ten fish samples and one lobster sample collected from near Swedish coast, M\u00e5sesk\u00e4r dumpsite were analysed. Trace concentrations below LOQ values were detected in three samples and the elemental composition of oxidized form of Clark I and \/or II was con-firmed by LC-HESI\/HRMS. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides the presence of CWA related chemicals in marine biota samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","authors":["Hanna Niemikoski","Martin S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m","Paula Vanninen"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.analchem.7b03429","first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T18:13:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0003-2700","1520-6882"],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1506363213,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.analchem.7b03429"],"pmid":"28877433","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Detection of chemical warfare agent-related phenylarsenic compounds in marine biota samples by LC-HESI\/MS\/MS","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-chemical-warfare-agentrelated-phenylarsenic-compounds-marine-biota-samples-lchesimsms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":7311439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116151,"mean":11.531161325872,"rank":94362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116151,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8031,"mean":3.4313267745953,"rank":6807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8031,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":3.9237260273973,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
