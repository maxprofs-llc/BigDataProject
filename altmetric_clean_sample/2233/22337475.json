Strain XZ2T grew optimally at pH 6.0, 30\u00b0C and in the absence of NaCl. The G+C content of the total DNA was 64.1 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain XZ2T showed the highest similarity to that of Camelimonas lactis M 2040T (99.1%), followed by Camelimonas abortus UK34\/07-5T (95.9%) and Chelatococcus daeguensis K106T (95.3%). The major cellular fatty acids of strain XZ2T were C19:0 cyclo \u03c98c (63.1%), C16:0 (15.0%) and C18:1 \u03c97c\/C18:1 \u03c96c (8.9%). C18:03-OH was also detected as the major hydroxylated fatty acid. The respiratory quinone was ubiquinone Q-10. The polar lipid profile included the major compounds phosphatidylcholine and diphosphatidylglycerol and moderate amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and two unidentified aminolipids. The predominant compound in the polyamine pattern was spermidine. These chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain XZ2T to the genus Camelimonas. DNA-DNA hybridization value between strain XZ2T and C. lactis M 2040T was 43.5 \u00b1 0.6 %. The DNA-DNA hybridization data as well as biochemical and physiological characteristics strongly supported the genotypic and phenotypic differentiations between strain XZ2T and C. lactis M 2040T. Strain XZ2T, therefore, represents a novel member of the genus Camelimonas, for which the name Camelimonas fluminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is XZ2T (=KCTC 42282T = ACCC 19738T).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079fb","authors":["Long Zhang","Man Song","Qin Cao","Shang Wu","Yan Zhao","Jun-Wei Huang","Kai Chen","Shun-Peng Li","Zhen-Yuan Xia","Jian-Dong Jiang"],"doi":"10.1099\/ijs.0.000384","first_seen_on":"2017-07-25T11:12:12+00:00","issns":["1466-5026","1466-5034"],"journal":"International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1501163001,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1099\/ijs.0.000384","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26297575"],"pmid":"26297575","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Microbiology Society","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Camelimonas fluminis sp. nov., a cyhalothrin-degrading bacterium isolated from river water","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":2114839,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5039671,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173148,"mean":11.592620859732,"rank":55225,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":116406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173148,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3784,"mean":2.7594480570975,"rank":480,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1277,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3784,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":1.5817475728155,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":88,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Camelimonas","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=792243775#altmetric_citation_34e4574a-143e-44fc-93a4-c61e33069dda","license":"public","citation_ids":[22337475,22337475],"posted_on":"2017-07-25T11:12:05+00:00","summary":"Beijerinckia is a genus of bacteria from the family of Beijerinckiaceae.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=54647108","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Daniel-Brown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Daniel-Brown"}},{"title":"Camelimonas fluminis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=792600765#altmetric_citation_55fe7f6d-a017-413e-9c4e-ef8b2862b3e4","license":"public","citation_ids":[22337475,22337475],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T13:43:21+00:00","summary":"Camelimonas fluminis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, short rod-shaped and non-spore-forming bacteria from the genus of Camelimonas which has been isolated from water from the Hanjiang River in Wuhan in China.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=54667062","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Daniel-Brown","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Daniel-Brown"}}]}}
