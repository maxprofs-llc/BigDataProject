The teeth were scanned with the CBCT unit PreXion 3D (Teracom, San Mateo, CA) operating at 2 different protocols: high resolution\/standard (HI-STD) (19\u00a0seconds and 512 basis images) and high resolution\/high density (HI-HI) (37\u00a0seconds and 1024 basis images). Three oral radiologists evaluated all images using multiplanar reconstructions. The diagnostic tests and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated.\nThe HI-STD and HI-HI protocols presented an accuracy of 0.90 and 0.93, respectively, and both protocols had a sensitivity of 0.97. The HI-HI protocol showed a higher positive predictive value and slightly higher areas under the ROC curve.\nBoth high-resolution imaging protocols presented high accuracy in the detection of incomplete root fracture of endodontically teeth. Thus, the HI-STD protocol should be indicated this reduces the radiation dose.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f6a","authors":["Wanderley, Victor Aquino","Neves, Frederico Sampaio","Nascimento, Monikelly Carmo Chagas","Monteiro, Gabriela Queiroz del Melo","Lobo, Nat\u00e1lia Siqueira","Oliveira, Matheus Lima","Nascimento Neto, Joao Batista Sobrinho","Araujo, Luciane Farias"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joen.2017.05.017","first_seen_on":"2017-07-25T10:09:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0099-2399","1878-3554"],"journal":"Journal of Endodontics","last_mentioned_on":1501032562,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28735791?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"28735791","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Detection of Incomplete Root Fractures in Endodontically Treated Teeth Using Different High-resolution Cone-beam Computed Tomographic Imaging Protocols","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/detection-incomplete-root-fractures-endodontically-treated-teeth-using-different-highresolution-cone"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8276988,"mean":6.9824426364262,"rank":4098417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4115237,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8276988,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171789,"mean":11.54844939111,"rank":83070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":86919,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171789,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":952,"mean":1.4824311251314,"rank":196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":952,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.63214285714286,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/dentalradiology\/statuses\/889789619688132608","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22331165],"posted_on":"2017-07-25T10:09:11+00:00","author":{"name":"Dental Radiology","url":"http:\/\/www.radiologiavaldivia.cl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/968927661\/7800506_normal.jpg","description":"Information for dentists & radiology specialist by @sergiouribe, DDS, Maxillofacial Radiologist.","id_on_source":"dentalradiology","tweeter_id":"153141448","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":358},"tweet_id":"889789619688132608"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rsadhan\/statuses\/890021192387538944","license":"gnip","rt":["dentalradiology"],"citation_ids":[22331165],"posted_on":"2017-07-26T01:29:22+00:00","author":{"name":"\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f\u062d\u0627\u0646 rsadhan","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507378826465128448\/IfLFdg0y_normal.jpeg","description":"\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0628 \u200f\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0623\u0634\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0645 Dentistry & Oral Radiology \u0648\u0643\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u0626 \u0645\u0641\u064a\u062f","id_on_source":"rsadhan","tweeter_id":"240523125","geo":{"lt":24.68773,"ln":46.72185,"country":"SA"},"followers":5565},"tweet_id":"890021192387538944"}]}}
