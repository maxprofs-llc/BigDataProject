In the present study, URB754 failed to inhibit 2-AG hydrolysis in rat brain preparations. In addition, brain cryosections were employed to assess whether URB754 could facilitate the detection of 2-AG-stimulated G protein activity. Nevertheless, whereas pretreatment with PMSF readily allowed detection of 2-AG-stimulated G protein activity, URB754 was ineffective. In contrast to previous claims, brain FAAH activity was also resistant to URB754. Thus, in our hands URB754 was not able to block the endocannabinoid-hydrolyzing enzymes and cannot serve as a lead structure for future development of MGL-specific inhibitors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024f0","doi":"10.1016\/j.chembiol.2006.07.008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T08:16:49+00:00","issns":["1074-5521"],"journal":"Chemistry & Biology","last_mentioned_on":1227731515,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.chembiol.2006.07.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16931330"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1074552106002651\/pdf","pmid":"16931330","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology","biochemistry"],"title":"URB754 has no effect on the hydrolysis or signaling capacity of 2-AG in the rat brain.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/urb754-effect-hydrolysis-signaling-capacity-2ag-rat-brain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9199904968162,"rank":815907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94733,"mean":8.1401172571044,"rank":24679,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94733,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":767,"mean":4.1352167101828,"rank":175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":767,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":2.7083333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
