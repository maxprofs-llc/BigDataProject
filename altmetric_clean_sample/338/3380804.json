Two major forms were identified. Form A and form B, with pI values of 4.5 and less than 4.0 respectively, separated at the chromatofocusing step in approximately equal amounts of recovered enzyme activity. By gel-filtration methods form A had a native molecular mass in the range 42-65 kDa. When analysed by SDS\/PAGE, dithioerythritol-reduced and non-reduced form A and form B consistently contained polypeptides of molecular masses 42 kDa and 14 kDa. Iduronate-2-sulphatase was purified from human kidney, placenta and lung, and form A was shown to have similar native molecular mass and subunit components to those observed for liver enzyme. Both forms of liver iduronate-2-sulphatase were active towards a variety of substrates derived from heparin and dermatan sulphate. Kinetic parameters (Km and Kcat) of form A were determined with a variety of substrates matching structural aspects of the physiological substrates in vivo, namely heparan sulphate, heparin and dermatan sulphate. Substrate with 6-sulphate esters on the aglycone residue adjacent to the iduronic acid 2-sulphate residue being attack were hydrolysed with catalytic efficiencies up to 200 times above that observed for the simplest disaccharide substrate without a 6-sulphated aglycone residue. The effect of incubation pH on enzyme activity towards the variety of substrates evaluated was complex and dependent on substrate aglycone structure, substrate concentration, buffer type and the presence of other proteins. Sulphate and phosphate ions and a number of substrate and product analogues were potent inhibitor of form A and form B enzyme activities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c1","authors":["J Bielicki","C Freeman","P R Clements","J J Hopwood"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T06:40:15+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0264-6021"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1197234094,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2222422","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1149515"],"pmcid":"PMC1149515","pmid":"2222422","pubdate":"1990-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Human liver iduronate-2-sulphatase.
