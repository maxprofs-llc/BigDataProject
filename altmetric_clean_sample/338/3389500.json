The main methods that are still in use are based on 'progressive alignment' and date from the mid to late 1980s. Recently, some dramatic improvements have been made to the methodology with respect either to speed and capacity to deal with large numbers of sequences or to accuracy. There have also been some practical advances concerning how to combine three-dimensional structural information with primary sequences to give more accurate alignments, when structures are available.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026aa","doi":"10.1016\/j.sbi.2005.04.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T10:46:36+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Current Opinion in Structural Biology","last_mentioned_on":1211992533,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.sbi.2005.04.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15963889"],"pmid":"15963889","pubdate":"2005-06-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence And Image Processing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Multiple sequence alignments.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-sequence-alignments-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":816182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94193,"mean":8.0982691948363,"rank":24440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94193,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":2.383968,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.75,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":26,"Student  > Ph.
