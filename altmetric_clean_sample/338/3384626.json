The crystal structures of all compounds except 1, 2, and 6 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and fully characterized by elemental analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The thermal stabilities were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC results show that all compounds exhibit high thermal stabilities (decomposition temperature >200 \u00b0C). Additionally, the heats of formation were calculated on the basis of the experimental constant-volume energies of combustion measured by using bomb calorimetry. Lastly, the sensitivities toward impact and friction were assessed according to Bundesamt f\u00fcr Materialforschung (BAM) standard methods.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Fugang Li"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic503021c","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T08:26:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1669"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1423183501,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic503021c"],"pmid":"25654400","pubdate":"2015-02-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nitrogen-Rich Salts Based on the Energetic [Monoaquabis(N,N-bis(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)amine)-zinc(II)] Anion: A Promising Design in the Development of New Energetic Materials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitrogenrich-salts-based-energetic-monoaquabisn-n-bis1-h-tetrazol5ylaminezincii-anion-promising-desi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4723507,"mean":5.6990890076161,"rank":3349695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":767536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4723507,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164973,"mean":8.7855944645155,"rank":115191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":32034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164973,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6364,"mean":1.0297472890146,"rank":2428,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":3088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6364,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.2298780487805,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
