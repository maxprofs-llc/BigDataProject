Uchida, Y. Hara, Y. Hirata, F. Marumo, and S. Sasaki. 1993. Nature [Lond.]. 361:549-552). Since urine concentrating ability varies among mammalian species, we examined whether an homologous protein is present in human kidney. By screening a human kidney cDNA library, we isolated a cDNA clone, designated human aquaporin of collecting duct (hAQP-CD), that encodes a 271-amino acid protein with 91% identity to rat AQP-CD. mRNA expression of hAQP-CD was predominant in the kidney medulla compared with the cortex, immunohistochemical staining of hAQP-CD was observed only in the collecting duct cells, and the staining was dominant in the apical domain. Functional expression study in Xenopus oocytes confirmed that hAQP-CD worked as a water channel. Western blot analysis of human kidney medulla indicated that the molecular mass of hAQP-CD is 29 kD, which is the same mass expected from the amino acid sequence. Chromosomal mapping of the hAQP-CD gene assigned its location to chromosome 12q13. These results could be important for future studies of the pathophysiology of human urinary concentration mechanisms in normal and abnormal states.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["S Sasaki","K Fushimi","H Saito","F Saito","S Uchida","K Ishibashi","M Kuwahara","T Ikeuchi","K Inui","K Nakajima"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci117079","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T10:03:55+00:00","issns":["0021-9738"],"journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1197916446,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1172\/JCI117079","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7510718","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC294077"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jci.org\/articles\/view\/117079\/files\/pdf","pmid":"7510718","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Cloning, characterization, and chromosomal mapping of human aquaporin of collecting duct.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-characterization-chromosomal-mapping-human-aquaporin-collecting-duct"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627775,"mean":4.946368885166,"rank":817481,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287138,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627775,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93683,"mean":8.029735936466,"rank":24223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93683,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4192,"mean":9.1372598425197,"rank":1586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":1735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4192,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":32.182486486486,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Aquaporin 2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=178547316#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3388008],"posted_on":"2007-12-17T18:34:06+00:00","summary":"AQP2 is found in the apical cell membranes of the kidney's collecting duct principal cells and in intracellular vesicles located throughout the cell.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=5601465","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Hodja Nasreddin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Hodja Nasreddin"}}]}}
