Myocardial stunning is characterised by transient contractile dysfunction that persists after reperfusion despite the absence of irreversible damage and despite restoration of normal or near normal coronary blood flow. Myocardial hibernation is a condition of sustained reduction of contractile function in hypoperfused but viable myocardium, which recovers completely upon reperfusion. Ischaemic preconditioning refers to a phenomenon by which one or more brief periods of myocardial ischaemia increases the ischaemic tolerance against infarction by endogenous adaptive mechanisms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9273cf058f61000dd14","authors":["F Grund"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T10:43:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0029-2001"],"issue":"4","journal":"Tidsskrift for den Norske l\u00e6geforening tidsskrift for praktisk medicin ny r\u00e6kke","last_mentioned_on":1212241320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11255859"],"pmid":"11255859","pubdate":"2001-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Three cardiac mysteries--stunning, hibernation and ischemic preconditioning].","type":"article","volume":"121","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tre-kardiale-mysterier-stunning-hibernering-og-iskemisk-prekondisjonering"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9286052998637,"rank":815675,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280038,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92287,"mean":7.1503221073619,"rank":23369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92287,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":184,"mean":2.2947322404372,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":184,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.75,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
