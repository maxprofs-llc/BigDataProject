This study evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SMT C1100 in healthy volunteers. This double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study comprised: Part 1, an escalating, single-dose with\/without fasting involving 50\u2009mg\/kg, 100\u2009mg\/kg, 200\u2009mg\/kg, and 400\u2009mg\/kg doses; and Part 2, a multiple 10 day dose evaluation involving 100\u2009mg\/kg bid and 200\u2009mg\/kg bid doses. Adverse events were recorded. SMT C1100 was absorbed rapidly following single and multiple oral doses, with median tmax attained within 2 to 3.5\u2009h across all doses. Considerable variability of pharmacokinetic parameters was noted amongst subjects. Following single doses, systemic exposure increased in a sub-proportional manner, with the 8.0-fold dose increment resulting in 2.7-, and 2.4-fold increases in AUC0-\u221e, and Cmax, respectively. AUC0-\u221e and Cmax were estimated as 4.2- and 4.8-fold greater, respectively, following food. Systemic exposure reduced upon repeat dosing with steady-state concentrations achieved within 3 to 5 days of multiple bid dosing. No serious or severe adverse events were reported. SMT C1100 was safe and well tolerated with plasma concentrations achieved sufficient to cause a 50% increase in concentrations of utrophin in cells in vitro. This article is protected by copyright.
