Here, we report the identification of alternative SUMOylation-dependent mechanisms that enable PPARgamma and LXRs to negatively regulate overlapping but distinct subsets of proinflammatory genes. Ligand-dependent conjugation of SUMO2\/3 to LXRs or SUMO1 to PPARgamma targets them to promoters of TLR target genes, where they prevent the signal-dependent removal of NCoR corepressor complexes required for transcriptional activation. SUMO1-PPARgamma and SUMO2\/3-LXRs inhibit distinct NCoR clearance mechanisms, allowing promoter- and TLR-specific patterns of repression. Mutational analysis and studies of naturally occurring oxysterol ligands indicate that the transactivation and SUMOylation-dependent transrepression activities of LXRs can be independently regulated. These studies define parallel but functionally distinct pathways that are utilized by PPARgamma and LXRs to differentially regulate complex programs of gene expression that control immunity and homeostasis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","doi":"10.1016\/j.molcel.2006.11.022","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T09:53:42+00:00","issns":["1097-2765"],"journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1246820914,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.molcel.2006.11.022","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17218271","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1850387"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S1097276506008161\/pdf","pmid":"17218271","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Parallel SUMOylation-dependent pathways mediate gene- and signal-specific transrepression by LXRs and PPAR\u03b3","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/parallel-sumoylationdependent-pathways-mediate-gene-signalspecific-transrepression-lxrs-ppar%CE%B3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9277809930899,"rank":815409,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92098,"mean":7.1218332844718,"rank":23307,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":67718,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92098,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3050,"mean":4.083363069859,"rank":753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1693,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3050,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":3.1538461538462,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":19,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":9,"Researcher":39,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
