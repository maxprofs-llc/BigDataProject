All mtDNAs with this mutation were then screened for a number of diagnostic RFLP sites, revealing two major subsets of mtDNAs. One is haplogroup V proper, and the other has been termed \"pre*V,\" since it predates V phylogenetically. The rather uncommon pre*V tends to be scattered throughout Europe (and northwestern Africa), whereas V attains two peaks of frequency: one situated in southwestern Europe and one in the Saami of northern Scandinavia. Geographical distributions and ages support the scenario that pre*V originated in Europe before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), whereas the more recently derived haplogroup V arose in a southwestern European refugium soon after the LGM. The arrival of V in eastern\/central Europe, however, occurred much later, possibly with (post-)Neolithic contacts. The distribution of haplogroup V mtDNAs in modern European populations would thus, at least in part, reflect the pattern of postglacial human recolonization from that refugium, affecting even the Saami. Overall, the present study shows that the dissection of mtDNA variation into small and well-defined evolutionary units is an essential step in the identification of spatial frequency patterns. Mass screening of a few markers identified using complete mtDNA sequences promises to be an efficient strategy for inferring features of human prehistory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","authors":["Torroni, A","Bandelt, H J","Macaulay, V","Richards, M","Cruciani, F","Rengo, C","Martinez-Cabrera, V","Villems, R","Kivisild, T","Metspalu, E","Parik, J","Tolk, H V","Tambets, K","Forster, P","Karger, B","Francalacci, P","Rudan, P","Janicijevic, B","Rickards, O","Savontaus, M L","Huoponen, K","Laitinen, V","Koivum\u00e4ki, S","Sykes, B","Hickey, E","Novelletto, A","Moral, P","Sellitto, D","Coppa, A","Al-Zaheri, N","Santachiara-Benerecetti, A S","Semino, O","Scozzari, R","Antonio Torroni","Hans-J\u00fcrgen Bandelt","Vincent Macaulay","Martin Richards","Fulvio Cruciani","Chiara Rengo","Vicente Martinez-Cabrera","Richard Villems","Toomas Kivisild","Ene Metspalu","J\u00fcri Parik","Helle-Viivi Tolk","Kristiina Tambets","Peter Forster","Bernd Karger","Paolo Francalacci","Pavao Rudan","Branka Janicijevic","Olga Rickards","Marja-Liisa Savontaus","Kirsi Huoponen","Virpi Laitinen","Satu Koivum\u00e4ki","Bryan Sykes","Eileen Hickey","Andrea Novelletto","Pedro Moral","Daniele Sellitto","Alfredo Coppa","Nadia Al-Zaheri","A.
