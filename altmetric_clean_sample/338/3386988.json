Comparison of the nucleotide sequence within the coding region of the human, and the predominant guinea-pig pre-alpha-lactalbumin mRNAs, with the analogous region of hen pre-lysozyme mRNA provides compelling evidence that all have evolved from a common ancestral gene.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Len Hall","Roger K.
