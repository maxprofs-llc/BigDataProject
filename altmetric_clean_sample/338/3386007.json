In this review, the authors discuss the most commonly encountered forms of APAH-CHD, how to interpret the hemodynamic data, and how to classify the patients into meaningful subgroups that have similar management strategies. The current state of targeted medical treatments available to patients with APAH-CHD is also discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005814","doi":"10.1016\/j.ccm.2013.08.011","first_seen_on":"2015-02-06T09:07:28+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Clinics in chest medicine","last_mentioned_on":1401675759,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ccm.2013.08.011","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24267300"],"pmid":"24267300","pubdate":"2013-11-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-associated-congenital-heart-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3831525,"mean":5.0347222560258,"rank":879595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2422372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3831525,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116975,"mean":9.0088072563136,"rank":34711,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":80917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116975,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":1.9006165413534,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":2.15,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":5,"Other":4,"Student  > Master":4,"Professor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":24,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CO":1,"NL":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Right-to-left shunt","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=611171497#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3386007],"posted_on":"2014-06-02T02:22:39+00:00","summary":"A right-to-left shunt is a cardiac shunt which allows blood to flow from the right heart to the left heart.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=3806302","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Salubrious Toxin","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Salubrious Toxin"}}]}}
