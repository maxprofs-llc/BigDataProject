Each constituent is integral to the final product, but it is often helpful to consider each component individually. While bone tissue engineering has capitalized on a number of breakthrough technologies, one of the most valued advancements is the incorporation of mesenchymal stem cells (SCs) into bone tissue engineering applications. With this new idea, however, came new found problems of guiding SC differentiation. Moreover, investigators are still working to understand which SCs source produces optimal bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal SCs and adipose-derived SCs have been researched most extensively, but other SC sources, including dental pulp, blood, umbilical cord blood, epithelial cells reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent SCs, among others, are being investigated. In Part II of this review series, we discuss the variety of cell types (e.g., osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, mesenchymal SCs, and vasculogenic cells) important in bone tissue engineering.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9a","authors":["Caroline Szpalski","Marissa Barbaro","Fabio Sagebin","Stephen M.
