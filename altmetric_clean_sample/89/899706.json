Rodent models of thiamine deficiency have yielded significant insight into the structural, neurochemical and cognitive deficits associated with thiamine deficiency as well as proven useful toward greater understanding of memory function in the intact brain. In this review, we discuss the anatomical, neurochemical and behavioral changes that occur during the acute and chronic phases of thiamine deficiency and describe how rodent models of Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome aid in developing a more detailed picture of brain structures involved in learning and memory.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","authors":["Vetreno RP","Ramos RL","Anzalone S","Savage LM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2011.11.038","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T08:15:11+00:00","issns":["0006-8993","00068993"],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1327009421,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0006899311021263"],"pmid":"22192411","pubdate":"2011-12-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Brain and behavioral pathology in an animal model of Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff Syndrome ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/brain-behavioral-pathology-animal-model-wernickes-encephalopathy-wernickekorsakoff-syndrome"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":2972721,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1398686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78108,"mean":5.3710921684355,"rank":48539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78108,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2529,"mean":2.7988639240506,"rank":1632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":854,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2529,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":0.87391304347826,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
