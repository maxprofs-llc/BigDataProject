Properties of systems, such as robustness, emerge as central issues, and understanding these properties may have an impact on the future of medicine. However, many breakthroughs in experimental devices, advanced software, and analytical methods are required before the achievements of systems biology can live up to their much-touted potential.","ads_id":"2002Sci...295.1662K","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["H.
