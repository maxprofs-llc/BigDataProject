Mutations in GRN and MAPT, two genes associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), have been found in clinically diagnosed AD cases. Due to the dramatic developments in next-generation sequencing (NGS), high-throughput sequencing of targeted genomic regions of the human genome in many individuals in a single run is now cheap and feasible. Recent findings favor the rare variant-common disease hypothesis by which the combination effects of rare variants could explain a large proportion of the heritability. We utilized NGS to identify rare and pathogenic variants in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, and MAPT in an Ibero-American cohort.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000792","authors":["Sheng Chih Jin","Sheng Chih Jin","Pau Pastor","Breanna Cooper","Sebastian Cervantes","Bruno A Benitez","Cristina Razquin","Alison Goate","Carlos Cruchaga"],"doi":"10.1186\/alzrt137","first_seen_on":"2012-08-21T15:18:58+00:00","issns":["","1758-9193"],"issue":"4","journal":"Alzheimer's Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1350345600,"links":["http:\/\/alzres.com\/content\/4\/4\/34\/abstract"],"pmid":"22906081","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Geriatrics\/Gerontology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"34","title":"Pooled-DNA sequencing identifies novel causative variants in PSEN1 , GRN and MAPT in a clinical early-onset and familial Alzheimer's disease Ibero-American cohort","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pooleddna-sequencing-identifies-novel-causative-variants-psen1-grn-mapt-clinical-earlyonset-familial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":1807848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1645033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74825,"mean":5.0472913236395,"rank":30230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":40230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74825,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"mean":5.2613875,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":161,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.9114285714286,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
