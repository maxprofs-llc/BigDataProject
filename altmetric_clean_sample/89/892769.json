Eligible patients were treated with a 3-week combination of paclitaxel 175 mg\/m2 and carboplatin area under the concentration time curve 5 mg\/ml\/min for a maximum of four cycles. A total of 27 patients entered the study. One patient (3.7%) had a complete response, whereas six patients (22.2%) obtained a partial response. Stable disease was observed in seven patients (25.9%). The disease control rate was 51.8% (95% confidence interval: 32.0-71.3), whereas overall response rate was 25.9% (95% confidence interval: 11.1-46.3). The median overall survival was 8.0 months (range: 2-27), with a 1-year survival of 30.5%. The median progression-free survival was 1.0 month (range: 0-14). Treatment-related deaths or episodes of neutropenic fever were not registered. Grades 3-4 neutropenia was observed in two patients (7.4%), grades 3-4 anaemia and thrombocytopenia in four (14.8%) and one (3.7%) patients, respectively. Nine patients (33.3%) experienced grades 1-2 and one patient (3.7%) grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is safe and moderately effective for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a63","authors":["Ferrari D","Fiore J","Codec\u00e0 C","Di Maria G","Bozzoni S","Bordin V","Caldiera S","Luciani A","Zonato S","Floriani I","Foa P"],"doi":"10.1097\/cad.0b013e328325a9d7","first_seen_on":"2012-08-17T19:12:27+00:00","issns":["0959-4973"],"issue":"3","journal":"Anti-Cancer Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1345480763,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19396017"],"pmid":"19396017","pubdate":"2009-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["antineoplasticagents"],"title":"A phase II study of carboplatin and paclitaxel for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-ii-study-carboplatin-paclitaxel-recurrent-metastatic-head-neck-cancer-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630565,"mean":4.929464153233,"rank":2015547,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":942253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630565,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73677,"mean":5.0636071447961,"rank":35012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73677,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":535,"mean":1.4602584269663,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":535,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hachidi\/statuses\/237589660220674048","license":"public","citation_ids":[892769],"posted_on":"2012-08-20T16:39:23+00:00","author":{"name":"Achidi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812740060332380160\/RHozj3Hb_normal.jpg","description":"Professor and Soccerite: Research interests in competitive strategy, entrepreneurship and IPOs (mainly biotech).
