Although diabetes-related dysfunctions of the stomach such as gastroparesis have been extensively studied over the recent years, studies about the mechanism underlying colonic symptoms in long-term diabetes models are rare. Therefore, the goal of our study was to clarify the nature of colonic dysfunction in a long-term diabetic rat model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc9f","authors":["Kim, Tae Wan"],"doi":"10.5056\/jnm.2011.17.4.372","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T00:33:18+00:00","issns":["2093-0879"],"journal":"Journal of Neurogastroenterology and Motility","last_mentioned_on":1326712953,"links":["http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/DOIx.php?id=10.5056%2Fjnm.2011.17.4.372&fbid=1012915437"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/Synapse\/Data\/PDFData\/0081JNM\/jnm-17-372.pdf","pmid":"22148106","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Alterations of Colonic Contractility in Long-term Diabetic Rat Model","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alterations-colonic-contractility-longterm-diabetic-rat-model"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":2972399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1398900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78108,"mean":5.3721279270743,"rank":48396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27280,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78108,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":391,"mean":1.1139743589744,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":391,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
