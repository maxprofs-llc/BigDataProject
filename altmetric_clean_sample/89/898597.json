As many as 40% of all sudden cardiac arrest victims have agonal or abnormal breathing in the first minutes following cardiac arrest. 9-1-1 call takers may wrongly interpret agonal breathing as a sign of life, and not initiate telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation instructions. Improving 9-1-1 call takers' ability to recognize agonal breathing as a sign of cardiac arrest could result in improved bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b2","authors":["Vaillancourt C","Jensen JL","Grimshaw J","Brehaut JC","Charette M","Kasaboski A","Osmond M","Wells GA","Stiell IG"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-227x-9-14","first_seen_on":"2012-08-22T00:50:09+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"BMC Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1344950557,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19646269"],"pmid":"19646269","pubdate":"1970-01-01T01:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Emergency Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"A survey of factors associated with the successful recognition of agonal breathing and cardiac arrest by 9-1-1 call takers: design and methodology.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-factors-associated-successful-recognition-agonal-breathing-cardiac-arrest-911-call-takers-des"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6931817,"mean":6.2209262311615,"rank":5942729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6931817,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94135,"mean":5.62482008626,"rank":75996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94135,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":4.6224390243902,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":3.3333333333333,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
