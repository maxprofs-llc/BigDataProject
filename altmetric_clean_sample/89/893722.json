The synthetic route features an efficient synthesis of 4 via a Buchwald-Hartwig coupling reaction, a dianion-mediated highly stereoselective alkylation of 4, and a rare example of an intramolecular Heck reaction of an enamine-type substrate. The stereoselective \u03b2-elimination and the accompanying Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement are of particular interest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Rui Ding","Bing-Feng Sun","Guo-Qiang Lin"],"doi":"10.1021\/ol301951r","first_seen_on":"2012-08-18T15:32:00+00:00","issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1345303783,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ol301951r"],"pmid":"22900755","pubdate":"2012-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"120817144041003","subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"\n              An Efficient Total Synthesis of (\u2212)-Huperzine A\n              \n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-total-synthesis-huperzine"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108104,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":978121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76897,"mean":5.3984659280066,"rank":50186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18486,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76897,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2864,"mean":3.2967921760391,"rank":2043,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":591,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2864,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":3.4982086956522,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
