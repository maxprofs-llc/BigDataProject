The as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) theory. The results indicated that the composite has a two-phase composition: CaWO(4) and Bi(2)WO(6). The photocatalytic activities of the CaWO(4)\/Bi(2)WO(6) composite were evaluated for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation (>420 nm), which were 4.5 times and 2.5 times higher than that of the pure Bi(2)WO(6), respectively. On the basis of the calculated energy band positions, the mechanism of enhanced photocatalytic activity for the micro\/nano-structured CaWO(4)\/Bi(2)WO(6) composite can be attributed to the effective separation of electron-hole pairs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Yadan Guo","Gaoke Zhang","Huihui Gan","Yalei Zhang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt31376f","first_seen_on":"2012-08-17T14:34:49+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"41","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1345213953,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2012\/dt\/c2dt31376f"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt31376f","pmid":"22964585","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"12697","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Micro\/nano-structured CaWO4\/Bi2WO6 composite: synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic properties for degradation of organic contaminants","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/micronanostructured-cawo4bi2wo6-composite-synthesis-characterization-photocatalytic-properties-degra-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3530167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134758,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76898,"mean":5.3960461916589,"rank":58831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76898,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.1020894288577,"rank":6301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
