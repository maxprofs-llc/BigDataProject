Because adequate coverage is vital to achieve program goals, periodically conducting surveys to validate reported coverage to guide NTD programs is recommended. Over the past decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collaborators conducted more than 30 two-stage cluster household surveys across three continents. The questionnaires gathered coverage data and information relevant to improving NTD programs including NTD-related attitudes and practices. From the 37 coverage survey estimates obtained in those surveys, 73.3% indicated an over reporting of coverage, including all three that assessed school-based distributions. It took an average of 1 week to conduct a survey. Our experiences led us to conclude that coverage surveys are useful and feasible tools to ensure NTD elimination and control goals are reached.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006990","authors":["Els Mathieu","Worrell C","Mathieu E","C.
