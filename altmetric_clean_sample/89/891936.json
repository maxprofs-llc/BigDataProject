The second objective was to determine time-to-cessation, recurrence, and new onset of each type of abuse. The Abuse History Interview (AHI) was administered to 290 borderline patients and 72 Axis II comparison subjects at baseline. The AHI Follow-up Version (AHI-FUV) was administered at five contiguous follow-up waves. Over 10 years of follow-up, the rates of all four types of abuse declined significantly for borderline patients. For borderline patients, rates of cessation were high for all types of abuse (>90%). However, recurrences and new onsets of verbal and emotional abuse were relatively common (>60%). Contrastingly, they were relatively uncommon for physical and sexual abuse (<30%), suggesting that verbal and emotional abuse represent more stable forms of abuse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb4","authors":["McGowan A","King H","Frankenburg FR","Fitzmaurice G","Zanarini MC"],"doi":"10.1521\/pedi.2012.26.2.192","first_seen_on":"2012-08-17T10:06:47+00:00","issns":["0885-579X"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Personality Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1345197873,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22486449?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC3325504","pmid":"22486449","pubdate":"2012-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"The Course of Adult Experiences of Abuse in Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder and Axis II Comparison Subjects: A 10-Year Follow-Up Study.","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/course-adult-experiences-abuse-patients-borderline-personality-disorder-axis-ii-comparison-subjects-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2324890,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1542936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":34},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76898,"mean":5.3960852048844,"rank":36423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":29297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76898,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":1.949432748538,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.66,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
