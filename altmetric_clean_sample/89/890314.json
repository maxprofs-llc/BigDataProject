In contrast, most human-like, interactive, and socially adept robotic systems turn away from embodiment and use amodal, symbolic, and modular approaches to cognition and interaction. At the same time, recent research in Embodied Cognition (EC) is spanning an increasing number of complex cognitive processes, including language, nonverbal communication, learning, and social behavior. This article suggests adopting a modern EC approach for autonomous robots interacting with humans. In particular, we present three core principles from EC that may be applicable to such robots: (a) modal perceptual representation, (b) action\/perception and action\/cognition integration, and (c) a simulation-based model of top-down perceptual biasing. We describe a computational framework based on these principles, and its implementation on two physical robots. This could provide a new paradigm for embodied human-robot interaction based on recent psychological and neurological findings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5373cf058f61000466f","authors":["Hoffman, Guy"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1756-8765.2012.01218.x","endpage":"772","first_seen_on":"2012-08-16T10:38:39+00:00","issns":["1756-8765","1756-8757"],"issue":"4","journal":"Topics in Cognitive Science","last_mentioned_on":1345115255,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22893571?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1756-8765.2012.01218.x&utm_source=buffer&buffer_share=b0076"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1756-8765.2012.01218.x\/pdf","pmid":"22893571","pubdate":"2012-08-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"759","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Embodied Cognition for Autonomous Interactive Robots.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/embodied-cognition-autonomous-interactive-robots"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506762,"mean":5.1233691071599,"rank":2089822,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2382736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506762,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70358,"mean":5.6472712025811,"rank":29310,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":40375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70358,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":6.0361627906977,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":72,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":3,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
