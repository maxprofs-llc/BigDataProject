The article reports on a social marketing campaign undertaken by the Australian Breastfeeding Association and a government health department, which used a product development strategy in order to increase breastfeeding loyalty. Seeking new approaches to support breastfeeding behaviors is critical and timely, because while initiation rates of breastfeeding are high in developed countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and the United States, duration rates are significantly lower. Results indicate that a product- focused strategy influences pregnant women's loyalty to exclusively breastfeeding.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000157b","authors":["Joy Parkinson","Rebekah Russell-Bennett","Josephine Previte"," Joy   Parkinson ","Parkinson J","Russell-Bennett R","Previte J"],"doi":"10.1080\/07359683.2012.705663","endpage":"238","first_seen_on":"2012-08-21T11:40:15+00:00","issns":["0735-9683","1545-0864"],"issue":"3","journal":"Health Marketing Quarterly","last_mentioned_on":1347461348,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/07359683.2012.705663"],"pmid":"22905944","pubdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Marketing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Business, Management and Accounting","Health Professions","Social Sciences"],"startpage":"223","subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Increasing Loyalty to Breastfeeding: Investigating a Product Development Strategy","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/07359683.2012.705663","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/increasing-loyalty-breastfeeding-investigating-product-development-strategy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.55,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.55},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":671316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":3833229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78083,"mean":5.3835678645527,"rank":11916,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":66109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78083,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.4919591836735,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":47,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
