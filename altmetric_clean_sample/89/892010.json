These data were confirmed by in vitro kinase assays using active recombinant kinase. Mitogen-activated protein kinase\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 efficiently phosphorylated its target ELK, but failed to phosphorylate Vif. Putative serine\/threonine phosphorylation point mutations in Vif (T96, S144, S165, T188) using single-round infection assays demonstrated that these mutations did not alter Vif activity, with the exception of Vif.T96E. Interestingly, T96E and not T96A was functionally impaired, indicating that this residue is critical for Vif-A3G physical interaction and activity. Our data suggest that Vif and A3G are not serine\/threonine phosphorylated in human cells and phosphorylation is not linked to their functional activities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9c","doi":"10.1099\/vir.0.043273-0","first_seen_on":"2012-08-17T10:18:15+00:00","issns":["1465-2099"],"journal":"Journal of General Virology","last_mentioned_on":1390321029,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22894923?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/vir.sgmjournals.org\/content\/93\/Pt_11\/2425.long","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1099\/vir.0.043273-0","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22894923"],"pmid":"22894923","pubdate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Interaction of Vif with APOBEC3G is not Dependent on Serine\/Threonine Phosphorylation Status.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interaction-human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1-vif-apobec3g-not-dependent-serinethreonine-phosphory-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4725905,"mean":5.5963178572073,"rank":1022775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":3683648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4725905,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77619,"mean":5.7314194903244,"rank":16545,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":60638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77619,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1102,"mean":2.7997202543143,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":938,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1102,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.809375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
