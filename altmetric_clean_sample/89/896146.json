PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"The E2F family of transcription factors plays an important role in controlling cell-cycle progression. While this is their best-known function, we report here novel functions for the newest members of the E2F family, E2F7 and E2F8 (E2F7\/8). We show that simultaneous deletion of E2F7\/8 in zebrafish and mice leads to severe vascular defects during embryonic development. Using a panel of transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent-labelled blood vessels, we demonstrate that E2F7\/8 are essential for proper formation of blood vessels. Despite their classification as transcriptional repressors, we provide evidence for a molecular mechanism through which E2F7\/8 activate the transcription of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a key factor in guiding angiogenesis. We show that E2F7\/8 directly bind and stimulate the VEGFA promoter independent of canonical E2F binding elements. Instead, E2F7\/8 form a transcriptional complex with the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) to stimulate VEGFA promoter activity. These results uncover an unexpected link between E2F7\/8 and the HIF1-VEGFA pathway providing a molecular mechanism by which E2F7\/8 control angiogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027b6","authors":["Bart G M W Weijts","Walbert J Bakker","Peter W A Cornelissen","Kuo-Hsuan Liang","Frank H Schaftenaar","Bart Westendorp","Charlotte A C M T de Wolf","Maya Paciejewska","Colinda L G J Scheele","Lindsey Kent","Gustavo Leone","Stefan Schulte-Merker","Alain de Bruin","Weijts BG","Bakker WJ","Cornelissen PW","Liang KH","Schaftenaar FH","Westendorp B","de Wolf CA","Paciejewska M","Scheele CL","Kent L","Leone G","Schulte-Merker S","de Bruin A"],"doi":"10.1038\/emboj.2012.231","endpage":"3884","first_seen_on":"2012-08-20T23:30:08+00:00","funders":["nci"],"issns":["ERROR!
