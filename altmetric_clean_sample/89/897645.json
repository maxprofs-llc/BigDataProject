Studies have since revealed that the gene products are part of an evolutionarily conserved PAR-atypical protein kinase C system involved in cell polarity in various biological contexts. In this study, we analyzed the function of par6 during sea urchin morphogenesis by morpholino-mediated knockdown and by manipulation swapping of the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). Loss of Par6 resulted in defects in skeletogenesis and gut differentiation in larvae. Phenotypic analyses of chimeras constructed by PMC swapping showed that Par6 in non-PMCs is required for differentiation of archenteron into functional gut. In contrast, Par6 in both PMCs and ectodermal cells cooperatively regulates skeletogenesis. We suggest that Par6 in PMCs plays an immediate role in the deposition of biomineral in the syncytial cable, whereas Par6 in ectoderm may stabilize skeletal rods via an unknown signal(s).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026ea","authors":["Kosuke Shiomi","Atsuko Yamazaki","Mitsuyoshi Kagawa","Masato Kiyomoto","Masaaki Yamaguchi"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00427-012-0409-5","first_seen_on":"2012-08-21T16:38:40+00:00","issns":["0949-944X","1432-041X"],"journal":"Development Genes & Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1345566983,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/gp043570t1791638\/"],"pmid":"22903233","pubdate":"2012-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Developmental Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["embryology","biology"],"title":"Par6 regulates skeletogenesis and gut differentiation in sea urchin larvae","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/par6-regulates-skeletogenesis-gut-differentiation-sea-urchin-larvae"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":2671974,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1694719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80630,"mean":5.6954469731735,"rank":38514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":31297,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80630,"percentile":38},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":3.227523255814,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.626,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
