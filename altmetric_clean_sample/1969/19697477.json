Ketoprofen is one of the most common drugs that can cause skin rash in sun-exposed areas. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketoprofen, are often used for a variety of symptoms, including pain and fever. An understanding of the presentation and clinical course of ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity is necessary to correctly diagnose and manage this condition. Ketoprofen-induced photosensitivity reactions usually present as photoallergic dermatitis, which is a cell-mediated immune process. The benzophenone moiety in ketoprofen plays a major role in ketoprofen's ability to act as a photosensitizer. Several agents, such as fenofibrate and octocrylene have been found to be associated with aggravation of ketoprofen-induced photoallergic dermatitis or cross-photosensitization, and these reactions result from structural similarities with ketoprofen. Treatment of ketoprofen-induced photoallergic dermatitis includes discontinuation of ketoprofen, topical or systemic corticosteroids and avoidance of sun exposure and agents known to exacerbate dermatitis. In conclusion, photoallergic dermatitis is a significant adverse effect of ketoprofen. Some agents known to worsen dermatitis may be found in sun protection products (notably, octocrylene in sunscreen). Educating the patient to avoid these products is critical to treatment. Since NSAIDs, such as ketoprofen, are used commonly for a variety of illnesses, drug-induced photoallergic dermatitis should be high on the differential in individuals using these medications who present with acute onset of a rash in sun-exposed areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002aad","authors":["Loh","Tiffany Yvonne Loh","Philip R Cohen"],"doi":"10.4103\/ijmr.ijmr_626_16","first_seen_on":"2017-04-29T10:22:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0971-5916"],"issue":"6","journal":"Indian Journal of Medical Research","last_mentioned_on":1493461320,"links":["http:\/\/www.ijmr.org.in\/article.asp?issn=0971-5916%3Byear%3D2016%3Bvolume%3D144%3Bissue%3D6%3Bspage%3D803%3Bepage%3D806%3Baulast%3DLoh#.WQRpQdYfDUk.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ijmr.org.in\/article.asp?issn=0971-5916;year=2016;volume=144;issue=6;spage=803;epage=806;aulast=Loh;type=2","pmid":"28474616","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medknow Publications","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Ketoprofen-induced photoallergic dermatitis","type":"article","volume":"144","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ketoprofeninduced-photoallergic-dermatitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148623,"mean":6.891955541924,"rank":7056362,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148623,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235104,"mean":12.63115540848,"rank":191252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235104,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":696,"mean":3.6421611510791,"rank":517,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":696,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.7833333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/rocatanho\/statuses\/858265094655967232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19697477],"posted_on":"2017-04-29T10:21:59+00:00","author":{"name":"rodolfo catanho","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/418701421031088129\/F1CIU3nb_normal.jpeg","description":"internist.  proudly friend of my friends.
