We report the efficacy of an individualized Treatment Program for Children with Aggressive Behavior.\nA within-subject design with two phases (waiting, treatment) was chosen. Sixty boys aged 6-12 years with peer-related aggressive behavior were included. The course of the outcome measures (growth rates) during a 6-week waiting phase was compared with those in the subsequent treatment phase (24 weekly child sessions together with an average of 8 parent contacts) by multilevel modeling. Primary outcome was peer-related aggressive behavior rated by parents. Further outcome measures included parent ratings and patient self-reports of aggressive and prosocial behavior.\nDuring the treatment, growth rates for all parent-rated outcome measures were significant (p\u2009<\u2009.001) and comparison with the waiting phase indicated a stronger decrease in aggressive behavior and a stronger increase in prosocial behavior. For all self-rated outcome measures, growth rates during the treatment were significant (p\u2009<\u2009.01), but comparison with the waiting phase indicated a stronger decrease only for disturbance of social interaction.\nThe treatment program is an effective intervention for children with peer-related aggressive behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d83cf058f6100013b6","authors":["Anja Goertz-Dorten","Christina Benesch","Christopher Hautmann","Emel Berk-Pawlitzek","Martin Faber","Timo Lindenschmidt","Rahel Stadermann","Lioba Schuh","Manfred Doepfner"],"doi":"10.1080\/10503307.2015.1094587","first_seen_on":"2017-04-29T08:05:25+00:00","issns":["1050-3307","1468-4381"],"journal":"Psychotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1493453111,"links":["http:\/\/tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/10503307.2015.1094587?ai=178&mi=6uzmnw&af=R"],"pmid":"26522864","pubdate":"2017-05-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","psychology"],"title":"Efficacy of an individualized social competence training for children with Oppositional Defiant Disorders\/Conduct Disorders","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-individualized-social-competence-training-children-oppositional-defiant-disordersconduct-di"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8148623,"mean":6.891955541924,"rank":7056363,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8148623,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235103,"mean":12.631211474168,"rank":191252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235103,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":303,"mean":3.3900794701987,"rank":249,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":303,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.3958333333333,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
