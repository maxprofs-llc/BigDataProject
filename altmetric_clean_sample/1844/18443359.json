It is critical that the genomic integrity of the cells remains intact and that the DNA repair systems are fully functional. In this article, we focused on the detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by phosphorylated histone H2AX (known as \u03b3H2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) in three distinct lines of hiPSCs, their source cells, and one line of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).\nWe measured spontaneously occurring DSBs throughout the process of fibroblast reprogramming and during long-term in vitro culturing. To assess the variations in the functionality of the DNA repair system among the samples, the number of DSBs induced by \u03b3-irradiation and the decrease over time was analysed. The foci number was detected by fluorescence microscopy separately for the G1 and S\/G2 cell cycle phases.\nWe demonstrated that fibroblasts contained a low number of non-replication-related DSBs, while this number increased after reprogramming into hiPSCs and then decreased again after long-term in vitro passaging. The artificial induction of DSBs revealed that the repair mechanisms function well in the source cells and hiPSCs at low passages, but fail to recognize a substantial proportion of DSBs at high passages.\nOur observations suggest that cellular reprogramming increases the DSB number but that the repair mechanism functions well. However, after prolonged in vitro culturing of hiPSCs, the repair capacity decreases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008b6","authors":["Pavel Simara","Lenka Tesarova","Daniela Rehakova","Pavel Matula","Stanislav Stejskal","Ales Hampl","Irena Koutna"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13287-017-0522-5","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T22:19:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1757-6512"],"issue":"1","journal":"Stem Cell Research & Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1491171568,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28327192?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28327192","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Stem Cells","scheme":"springer"}],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"DNA double-strand breaks in human induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming and long-term in vitro culturing","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-doublestrand-breaks-human-induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-reprogramming-longterm-vitro-culturing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250144,"mean":13.14817468408,"rank":206892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250144,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":683,"mean":4.9403607038123,"rank":606,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":3.3338064516129,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jamessodabi\/statuses\/848661185943805953","license":"gnip","rt":["genomeguardian"],"citation_ids":[18443359],"posted_on":"2017-04-02T22:19:28+00:00","author":{"name":"Nkumbulo JamesSodabi","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2384770780\/c153yy3iu3iocfmkd03o_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"jamessodabi","tweeter_id":"631894531","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":240},"tweet_id":"848661185943805953"}]}}
