Using the individual-based model of Wright and Fisher, we compute the amplitude of neutral aggregation in the genome space, i.e., the probability of finding two individuals at genetic (Hamming) distance k as a function of the genome size L, population size N, and mutation probability per base \u03bd. In well-mixed populations, we show that for N\u03bd<1\/L, neutral aggregation is the dominant force and most individuals are found at short genetic distances from each other. For N\u03bd>1, on the contrary, individuals are randomly dispersed in genome space. The results are extended to a geographically dispersed population, where the controlling parameter is shown to be a combination of mutation and migration probability. The theory we develop can be used to test the neutrality hypothesis in various ecological and evolutionary systems.","authors":["Bahram Houchmandzadeh"],"doi":"10.1103\/physreve.95.012402","first_seen_on":"2017-04-02T23:20:45+00:00","issns":["2470-0045","2470-0053"],"issue":"1","journal":"Physical Review E","last_mentioned_on":1491175231,"links":["https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/pre\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.012402"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevE.95.012402","pmid":"28208412","pubdate":"2017-01-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","title":"Neutral aggregation in finite-length genotype space","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neutral-aggregation-finitelength-genotype-space"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlackPhysicists\/statuses\/848676548408487936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18444277],"posted_on":"2017-04-02T23:20:31+00:00","author":{"name":"BlackPhysicists","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/502208695854313472\/mupwPlOC_normal.jpeg","id_on_source":"BlackPhysicists","tweeter_id":"46854930","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":16472},"tweet_id":"848676548408487936"}]}}
