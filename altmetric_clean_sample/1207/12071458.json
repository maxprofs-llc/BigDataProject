AFB1 binding percentages varied among yeast strains and with AFB1 concentrations. To carry out the adsorptions studies, one strain from each genus and each origin was selected as follows: C. lusitaniae and P. kudriavzevii from feedstuff, C. lusitaniae and Cyberlindnera fabianii from feaces and C. tropicalis from gut. The most appropriate concentrations for cells and toxin were 10(7) cell ml(-1) and 100 ng ml(-1) of AFB1 , respectively. All the tested yeast strains showed similar adsorption capacities independently of the origin. The adsorption isotherms studies in all yeasts assayed showed behaviour of L type or Langmuir and a varied affinity for the toxin. The stability of the complex AFB1 yeast demonstrated the irreversibility of the binding process.\nYeast strains tested in the present work constitute potential AFB1 adsorbents and they possess the advantage to be native from the avian environment.\nThis work makes a contribution on using of native yeasts from broilers' environment for controlling chronic aflatoxicosis in avian production.
