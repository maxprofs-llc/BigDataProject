Organotypic (3D) dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) cultures\/microtissues, developed to mimic the physiological conditions in vivo, were utilized to assess the bacterial impact on their (i) 3D structural configuration, and (ii) recovery mechanisms. The cultures, developed in extracellular matrix (ECM) bio-scaffold (MatrigelTM), interacted with Wild type and GFP-tagged bacterial biofilms by permitting their infiltration through the ECM. Challenged cell constructs were visualized by F-actin\/nuclei staining. Their pluripotency (Sox2) and differentiation (Osteocalcin) markers were assessed by immunocytochemistry. Secreted mineral was detected by alizarin red and 3D structural arrangements were analyzed by epi-fluorescence and confocal scanning microscopy. Bacterial biofilm\/ECM-embedded DPSCs interactions appeared in distinct areas of the microtissues. Bacterial attachment to the cell surface occurred without evidence of invasion. Surface architecture of the challenged vs. unchallenged microtissues was apparently unaltered. However, significant increases in thickness (138.42 \u03bcm vs 106.51 \u03bcm) and bacterial penetration were detected in challenged structures causing canal-like microstructures with various diameters (12.94 \u03bcm - 42.88 \u03bcm) and average diameters of 20.66 \u03bcm to 33.42 \u03bcm\/microtissue. Challenged constructs expressed pluripotency and differentiation markers, and secreted the mineral. Presented model shows strong potential for assessing pulp-pathogen interactions in vivo. S. mutans infiltrated and penetrated the microtissues but did not invade the cells or compromised major cell repair mechanisms. These findings would suggest reexamining Streptococcus mutans role as an endodontic pathogen and investigating DPSCs resistance to its pathogenicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d51","authors":["Kaufman, Gili","Skrtic, Drago"],"doi":"10.1099\/jmm.0.000353","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T10:58:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5644","0022-2615"],"journal":"Journal of Medical Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1474194286,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27638752?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27638752","pubdate":"2016-09-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Structural and recovery mechanisms of 3D dental pulp cell microtissues challenged with Streptococcus mutans in extracellular matrix environment","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-recovery-mechanisms-3d-dental-pulp-cell-microtissues-challenged-streptococcus-mutans-extr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":4237945,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3942678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254179,"mean":12.672386634563,"rank":129664,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":114914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254179,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1057,"mean":2.8162556818182,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1057,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.318,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
