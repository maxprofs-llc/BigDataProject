Although most \u03b1-keto acids are currently produced by chemical synthesis, their biotechnological production from renewable carbohydrates is a promising new approach. In this mini-review, we first present the different types of \u03b1-keto acids as well as their applications; next, we summarize the recent progresses in the biotechnological production of some important \u03b1-keto acids; namely, pyruvate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, \u03b1-ketoisovalerate, \u03b1-ketoisocaproate, phenylpyruvate, \u03b1-keto-\u03b3-methylthiobutyrate, and 2,5-diketo-d-gluconate. Finally, we discuss the future prospects as well as favorable directions for the biotechnological production of keto acids that ultimately would be more environment-friendly and simpler compared with the production by chemical synthesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023f5","authors":["Song, Yang","Li, Jianghua","Shin, Hyun-Dong","Liu, Long","Du, Guocheng","Chen, Jian"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biortech.2016.08.015","endpage":"724","first_seen_on":"2016-09-19T02:56:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-2976","09608524"],"journal":"Bioresource Technology","last_mentioned_on":1474250241,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0960852416311361&_version=1&md5=1c4f2682e3869d5890f73ff3340eabe6"],"pmid":"27575335","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"716","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Biotechnological production of alpha-keto acids: Current status and perspectives","type":"article","volume":"219","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biotechnological-production-alphaketo-acids-current-status-perspectives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8403724,"mean":7.0757025513494,"rank":6377760,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1140332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8403724,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254069,"mean":12.659958869279,"rank":178823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":43993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254069,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2195,"mean":2.2275369188696,"rank":1178,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":684,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2195,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114,"mean":1.6012389380531,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":46,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
