Coexistence of underweight and overweight persons is symptomatic of the \"double burden of malnutrition.\" The present study throws new light on the \"double burden of malnutrition\" among Indian women in the age group 22-49 years. The analysis is based on a nationally representative household survey, India Human Development Survey. Our results indicate the continuing pattern of socioeconomic segregation of underweight and overweight\/obese women, with a large concentration of underweight women among the low socioeconomic group and of overweight\/obese women among the high socioeconomic group. Further, relative food prices of food items like cereals and vegetables are significantly associated with the risk of being underweight and overweight\/obese. Additionally, we find notable rural\/urban differences. The relationship between socioeconomic factors and the probability of being underweight and overweight\/obese is stronger in urban than in rural areas. Given that the health implications of being underweight and overweight\/obese are equally grim, provision of healthy food items at affordable prices and implementation of programs for preventive and curative care of plausible illnesses related to underweight and overweight\/obese are imperative.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100059a4","authors":["Kulkarni, Vani S","Kulkarni, Veena S","Gaiha, Raghav"],"doi":"10.1177\/0020731416664666","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T12:28:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1541-4469","0020-7314"],"journal":"International Journal of Health Services","last_mentioned_on":1474200788,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27638762?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27638762","pubdate":"2016-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","healthservices"],"title":"\"Double Burden of Malnutrition\": Reexamining the Coexistence of Undernutrition and Overweight Among Women in India","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/double-burden-malnutrition-reexamining-coexistence-undernutrition-overweight-among-women-india"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":4483119,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2337168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254179,"mean":12.672358701382,"rank":140440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254179,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":516,"mean":7.7850291262136,"rank":416,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":516,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":36.8072,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
