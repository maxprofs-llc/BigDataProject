Neither the clinical activity of anti-PD-1 nor the incidence of an immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment has been described for GCTs. A patient initially diagnosed with melanoma via fine needle aspiration was treated with one dose of antibody to PD-1. A core needle biopsy was subsequently performed to acquire sufficient tissue for molecular analysis, which led to a change in diagnosis to metastatic embryonal carcinoma. The testicular GCT cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed using a T-cell gene signature associated with benefit from immunotherapy. Primary tumors (N = 134) were categorized as high (T cell-inflamed), medium, or low (non-T cell-inflamed) by their T-cell signature derived from RNAseq data. Anti-PD-1 induced decreases in serum markers and a 33% reduction in tumor volume. Gene expression revealed a T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in 47% of testicular GCTs, including seminoma (83%) and non-seminoma (17%) tumor subtypes. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) RNA correlated with lack of the T-cell signature, with increasing AFP RNA inversely correlating with the inflamed signature and expression of interferon-\u03b3-associated genes. These data suggest that GCTs can respond to anti-PD-1 and that gene expression profiling supports investigation of immunotherapy for treatment of GCTs.","altmetric_jid":"588f1b3f7ac79ee9d1496f63","authors":["Shah, Shalin","Ward, James E","Bao, Riyue","Hall, Curtis R","Brockstein, Bruce E","Luke, Jason J"],"doi":"10.1158\/2326-6066.cir-16-0087","first_seen_on":"2016-09-18T10:08:17+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["2326-6074","2326-6066"],"issue":"11","journal":"Cancer Immunology Research","last_mentioned_on":1478168110,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27638840?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27638840","pubdate":"2016-09-16T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Clinical response of a patient to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and the immune landscape of testicular germ cell tumors","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-response-patient-antipd1-immunotherapy-immune-landscape-testicular-germ-cell-tumors"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7639268,"mean":6.5692022176954,"rank":5506299,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1860626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7639268,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":245122,"mean":12.402800135443,"rank":160439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":71521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":245122,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":433,"mean":6.5950555555556,"rank":326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":433,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":5.4444444444444,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
