Screw loosening is a major problem of spine fusion, contributing to delayed patient recovery. The present study aimed to understand the factor and interaction effects of density, insertion depth and insertion angle on pedicle screw pull out strength and insertion torque. A pull out study was carried out on rigid polyurethane foam blocks representing osteoporotic to normal bone densities according to the ASTM-1839 standard. It was found that density contributes most to pullout strength and insertion torque. The interaction effect is significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and contributes 8% to pull out strength. Axial pullout strength was 34% lower than angled pull out strength in the osteoporotic bone model. Insertion angle had no significant effect (p\u2009>\u20090.05) on insertion torque. Pullout strength and insertion torque had no significant correlation (p\u2009>\u20090.05) in the case of the extremely osteoporotic bone model.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5023cf058f610003096","authors":["Vicky Varghese","Gurunathan Saravana Kumar","Venkatesh Krishnan"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.medengphy.2016.11.012","first_seen_on":"2016-12-10T05:52:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1350-4533","1873-4030","13504533"],"journal":"Medical Engineering & Physics","last_mentioned_on":1487512960,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medengphys.com%2Farticle%2FS1350-4533%252816%252930293-4%2Fabstract&code=jjbe-site","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27939099"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.medengphys.com\/article\/S1350453316302934\/pdf","pmid":"27939099","pubdate":"2016-12-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Effect of various factors on pull out strength of pedicle screw in normal and osteoporotic cancellous bone models","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1350453316302934","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-various-factors-pull-strength-pedicle-screw-normal-osteoporotic-cancellous-bone-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":4382012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2294027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272303,"mean":12.109833949071,"rank":150006,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272303,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":289,"mean":2.1077152777778,"rank":115,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":289,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":1.5208333333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
