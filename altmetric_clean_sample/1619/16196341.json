Of all included patients, 10% (n = 101) were diagnosed with PTB. Mortality during follow-up was 5% (n = 48), with a mean survival time of 158 days (95%CI 27-289) in prePTB patients diagnosed with PTB vs. 144 days (95%CI 109-178) in those not diagnosed with PTB (P = 0.774). After adjusting for HIV status and age, the best separate predictor was suPAR \ue2f65 ng\/ml, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 4.6 (95%CI 2.1-9.9) for mortality and 6.7 (95%CI 4.0-11.2) for TB diagnosis. All patients who died had a TBscore II + suPAR \ue2f67; the HR of the composite score for subsequent PTB diagnosis was 33.0 (95%CI 4.6-236.6).\nThe proposed composite score of suPAR + TBscore II \ue2f67 can improve TB case finding and clinical monitoring.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f610007a18","authors":["F.
