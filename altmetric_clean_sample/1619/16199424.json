Women for whom telephone numbers were obtained (N = 771) were randomly assigned to RDD or TTC. The respondents participated in a brief telephone interview. Odd ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate differences in characteristics of the respondents between the two contact strategies.\nTelephone numbers were obtained for 79% of women aged > or = 55 years and for only 38% of women aged < 55 years. Interviews were obtained for 48% of women for whom we obtained telephone numbers, and for 77% of women for whom eligibility was confirmed via telephone contact. Participation of target women appeared to be higher for the TTC than the RDD group (42% vs. 35%, p = 0.054). Among respondents who were > or = 55 years old, those in the TTC group were 80% more likely (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 0.9-3.4) to report a serious medical condition than women in the RDD group, 60% less likely (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-1.0) to report having used oral contraceptives, and 80% less likely (OR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1-0.5) to report having had breast surgery.\nCharacteristics of respondents differed according to method of contact. These differences, along with the sampling frame used, should be considered when interpreting findings of case-control studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002276","authors":["E Funkhouser"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1047-2797(99)00046-0","first_seen_on":"2017-02-07T12:29:15+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["10472797","1047-2797"],"issue":"1","journal":"Annals of Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1009843200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1047-2797(99)00046-0"],"pmid":"10658689","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["epidemiology"],"title":"Alternative Strategies for Selecting Population Controls Comparison of Random Digit Dialing and Targeted Telephone Calls","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S1047279799000460","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-strategies-selecting-population-controls-comparison-random-digit-dialing-targeted-teleph"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7135978,"mean":6.3032679424247,"rank":1684248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4576767,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7135978,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95334,"mean":11.015256123273,"rank":29369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":64359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95334,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":886,"mean":7.1152971751412,"rank":280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":886,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.1,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
