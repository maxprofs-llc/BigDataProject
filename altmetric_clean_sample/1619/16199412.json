In both samples, performance of microvascular\/glycemic control activities and cardiovascular lab checks (84% and 74%) was significantly higher than behavioral self-management\/patient-focused activities (61% and 48%) (p<0.001). From a set of patient, physician, and practice setting characteristics, only the use of community resources for chronic illness management support was associated with service performance.\nWe found considerable variability in the levels of performance in providing PRP-recommended activities. Greater attention should be focused on self-management and patient-focused activities, given that these are delivered less frequently than medical\/laboratory checks.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002215","authors":["Russell E Glasgow","Lisa A Strycker"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0749-3797(00)00157-4","first_seen_on":"2017-02-07T12:28:24+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["07493797","0749-3797"],"issue":"1","journal":"American Journal of Preventive Medicine","last_mentioned_on":978307200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0749-3797(00)00157-4"],"pmid":"10865158","pubdate":"2000-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Preventive care practices for diabetes management in two primary care samples","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0749379700001574","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preventive-care-practices-diabetes-management-two-primary-care-samples"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7135978,"mean":6.3032679424247,"rank":1684245,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4576761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7135978,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95332,"mean":11.01489139944,"rank":29369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":64357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95332,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2264,"mean":20.310558550597,"rank":1182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2264,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":48.33092,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":27}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
