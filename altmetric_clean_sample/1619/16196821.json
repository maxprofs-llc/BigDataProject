It is acknowledged as important, both in terms of preserving and also reducing the cost of future conservation measures. Therefore, long-term monitoring of physical parameters influencing cultural heritage is necessary. In the context of Smart Cities, monitoring of cultural heritage is of interest in order to perform future comparative studies and load information into the cloud that will be useful for the conservation of other heritage sites. In this paper the development of an economical and appropriate acquisition data system combining wired and wireless communication, as well as third party hardware for increased versatility, is presented. The device allows monitoring a complex network of points with high sampling frequency, with wired sensors in a 1-wire bus and a wireless centralized system recording data for monitoring of physical parameters, as well as the future possibility of attaching an alarm system or sending data over the Internet. This has been possible with the development of three board's designs and more than 5000 algorithm lines. System tests have shown an adequate system operation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5333cf058f6100045ba","authors":["Garc\u00eda Diego, Fernando Juan","Esteban, Borja","Merello Gim\u00e9nez, Paloma","Fernando Juan Garc\u00eda Diego","Borja Esteban","Paloma Merello Gim\u00e9nez"],"doi":"10.3390\/s150407246","first_seen_on":"2017-02-07T10:31:29+00:00","handle":"10251\/77685","handles":["10251\/77685"],"issns":["1424-8220"],"issue":"4","journal":"Sensors (14248220)","last_mentioned_on":1486463477,"links":["https:\/\/riunet.upv.es\/handle\/10251\/77685"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/riunet.upv.es\/bitstream\/10251\/77685\/1\/Garc%c3%ada%3bEsteban%3bMerello%20-%20Design%20of%20a%20Hybrid%20%28Wired\/Wireless%29%20Acquisition%20Data%20System%20for%20Monitori....pdf","pmid":"25815447","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"MDPI","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Electrical And Electronic Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Design of a Hybrid (Wired\/Wireless) Acquisition Data System for Monitoring of Cultural Heritage Physical Parameters in Smart Cities","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1424-8220\/15\/4\/7246\/","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-hybrid-wiredwireless-acquisition-data-system-monitoring-cultural-heritage-physical-parameters"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8172683,"mean":6.9158600214652,"rank":7072698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8172683,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263988,"mean":12.85289113479,"rank":219132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263988,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3368,"mean":1.9444811404811,"rank":2352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3368,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":566,"mean":1.7084707964602,"rank":374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":566,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
