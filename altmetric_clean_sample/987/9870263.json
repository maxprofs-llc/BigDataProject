Using regression analyses we found that when iPod dependence was the dependent variable, Text2-excessive use, Text4-psychological and behavioral symptoms, iPod2-excessive use, and iPod3-relationship disruption were significant predictors of discounting. When texting dependence was the dependent variable, Text4-psychological and behavioral symptoms and iPod3-relationship disruption were significant predictors of discounting. These are the first data to show that delay discounting relates to certain aspects of social media, namely iPod and texting dependence. These data also show that across these 2 dependencies, both psychological and behavioral symptoms and relationship disruptions are affected.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002218","authors":["Ferraro, F Richard","Weatherly, Jeffrey N"],"first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T03:23:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0002-9556"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1469055397,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27424418?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27424418","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Texting Dependence, iPod Dependence, and Delay Discounting.","type":"article","volume":"129"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":4275046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2244232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257817,"mean":11.979241435752,"rank":141644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":90466,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257817,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":301,"mean":5.2017133333333,"rank":232,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":301,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/distractionfree\/statuses\/755603944928272384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9870263],"posted_on":"2016-07-20T03:23:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/DistractionFree","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1393243310\/distracted_driving_cell_phone_normal.jpg","description":"Working to prevent distracted driving.","id_on_source":"distractionfree","tweeter_id":"313681956","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1254},"tweet_id":"755603944928272384"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/distractionfree\/statuses\/755899239914283009","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9870263],"posted_on":"2016-07-20T22:56:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Mary","url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/DistractionFree","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1393243310\/distracted_driving_cell_phone_normal.jpg","description":"Working to prevent distracted driving.","id_on_source":"distractionfree","tweeter_id":"313681956","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1254},"tweet_id":"755899239914283009"}]}}
