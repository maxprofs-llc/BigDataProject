Plasma levels of free and total testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. Hirsutism was evaluated according to the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score. Questionnaires assessing female sexual function (Female Sexual Function Index) and the presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition) were completed by each participant.\nSexual function and depressive symptoms in young women with NC-CAH.\nWomen with NC-CAH presented increased plasma levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and higher hirsutism scores compared with healthy women. The study group also showed a lower total Female Sexual Function Index score and lower scores in four domains (sexual arousal, lubrication, sexual satisfaction, and dyspareunia). Scores for sexual desire and orgasm correlated with total hirsutism score and testosterone levels. The Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire showed that the total score was higher in women with NC-CAH than in healthy women, correlating with the hirsutism score and testosterone levels.\nThe presence of NC-CAH in young women is associated with impaired sexual function and mild depressive symptoms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52c3cf058f6100040d4","authors":["Krysiak, Robert","Drosdzol-Cop, Agnieszka","Skrzypulec-Plinta, Violetta","Okopien, Bogus\u0142aw"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jsxm.2015.11.002","endpage":"39","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T11:14:58+00:00","issns":["1743-6109","1743-6095"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Sexual Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1453278224,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.jsm.jsexmed.org\/article\/S1743-6095(15)00004-1\/abstract&rc=0&code=jsxm-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jsm.jsexmed.org\/article\/S1743609515000041\/pdf","pmid":"26755084","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"34","subjects":["reproductivemedicine","gynecology"],"title":"Sexual Function and Depressive Symptoms in Young Women With Nonclassic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-function-depressive-symptoms-young-women-nonclassic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6997887,"mean":6.2543742573087,"rank":4980523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1767304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6997887,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247172,"mean":11.589044952684,"rank":159143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":74341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247172,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1762,"mean":13.328844974446,"rank":1462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1762,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":9.4904137931034,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"FR":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jsexmed\/statuses\/689695925145468928","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9878926],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T06:28:17+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal Sexual Med.","url":"http:\/\/jsm.issm.info","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/685879503717969921\/IihLJ5gh_normal.jpg","description":"JSM is the premier, authoritative publication in the field of Sexual Medicine, publishing high impact multidisciplinary basic and clinical science monthly.","id_on_source":"jsexmed","tweeter_id":"2584082934","geo":{"lt":39.76,"ln":-98.5,"country":"US"},"followers":3637},"tweet_id":"689695925145468928"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/adnan_bakri\/statuses\/689724982595813377","license":"gnip","rt":["jsexmed"],"citation_ids":[9878926],"posted_on":"2016-01-20T08:23:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr Adnan El Bakri","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dr-adnan-el-bakri-404869a6\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/859110600110198784\/hKGP5BJg_normal.jpg","description":"MD,PhD candidate.
