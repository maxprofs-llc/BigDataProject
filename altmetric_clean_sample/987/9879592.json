Tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) is an apoptotic protein that was robustly induced in the transgenic C. elegans AD brains. However, the roles of TNFAIP1 in AD have not been investigated.\nWe found TNFAIP1 protein and mRNA levels were dramatically elevated in primary mouse cortical neurons and Neuro2a (N2a) cells exposed to A\u03b225-35. Knockdown and overexpression of TNFAIP1 significantly attenuated and exacerbated A\u03b225-35-induced neurotoxicity in N2a cells, respectively. Further studies showed that TNFAIP1 knockdown significantly blocked A\u03b225-35-induced cleaved caspase 3, whereas TNFAIP1 overexpression enhanced A\u03b225-35-induced cleaved caspase 3, suggesting that TNFAIP1 plays an important role in A\u03b225-35-induced neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, we observed that TNFAIP1 was capable of inhibiting the levels of phosphorylated Akt and CREB, and also anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. TNFAIP1 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effect of A\u03b225-35 on the levels of p-CREB and Bcl-2, while TNFAIP1 knockdown reversed A\u03b225-35-induced attenuation in the levels of p-CREB and Bcl-2.\nThese results suggested that TNFAIP1 contributes to A\u03b225-35-induced neurotoxicity by attenuating Akt\/CREB signaling pathway, and Bcl-2 expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007cd","authors":["Ning Liu","Zhanyang Yu","Yu Xun","Miaomiao Li","Xiaoning Peng","Ye Xiao","Xiang Hu","Yi Sun","Manjun Yang","Shiquan Gan","Shishan Yuan","Xiaoying Wang","Shuanglin Xiang","Jian Zhang","Liu, Ning","Yu, Zhanyang","Xun, Yu","Li, Miaomiao","Peng, Xiaoning","Xiao, Ye","Hu, Xiang","Sun, Yi","Yang, Manjun","Gan, Shiquan","Yuan, Shishan","Wang, Xiaoying","Xiang, Shuanglin","Zhang, Jian"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12868-016-0286-3","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T12:06:56+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2202"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1469294027,"links":["http:\/\/bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12868-016-0286-3","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27430312"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12868-016-0286-3?site=bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC4949755","pmid":"27430312","pubdate":"2016-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Models","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"TNFAIP1 contributes to the neurotoxicity induced by A\u03b225\u201335 in Neuro2a cells","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tnfaip1-contributes-neurotoxicity-induced-a%CE%B22535-neuro2a-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093786,"mean":6.8854606510969,"rank":892408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7189668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093786,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257919,"mean":11.981840972712,"rank":42071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":215026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257919,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":828,"mean":3.606377267231,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":745,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":828,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.7428387096774,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
