(Enders)"],"citation":{"abstract":"A strategy for the NHC-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of spirobenzazepinones, spiro-1,2-diazepinones, and spiro-1,2-oxazepinones has been developed via [3+4]-cycloaddition reactions of isatin-derived enals (3C component) with in-situ-generated aza-o-quinone methides, azoalkenes, and nitrosoalkenes (4atom components). The [3+4] annulation strategy leads to the seven-membered target spiro heterocycles bearing an oxindole moiety in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities with a wide variety of substrates. Notably, the benzazepinone synthesis is atroposelective and an all-carbon spiro stereocenter is generated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069cf","authors":["Wang, Lei","Li, Sun","Bl\u00fcmel, Marcus","Philipps, Arne R.","Wang, Ai","Puttreddy, Rakesh","Rissanen, Kari","Enders, Dieter"],"doi":"10.1002\/anie.201604819","endpage":"11114","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T09:30:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3773"],"issue":"37","journal":"Angewandte Chemie.
