Cefoxitin (Cef), a cephalosporin antibiotic, is generally used to prevent and treat postoperative infections. In this study, we describe the incorporation of Cef in HA thin films (Cef-HAF) by using electrospraying. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that HA-containing thin films (HAF) were composed of numerous nanoparticles (255\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0177\u00a0nm in diameter) with irregular surfaces, connected to each other with nanofibers of 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0nm in diameter. Cef-HAF contained fewer, but larger, particles (551\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0293\u00a0nm) with smooth surfaces and were interconnected with nanofibers of 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0nm in diameter. Differences in surface morphology between HAF and Cef-HAF were confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that Cef was not modified when incorporated into Cef-HAF and remained active against Klebsiella pneumoniae Xen 39, Staphylococcus aureus Xen 36 and Listeria monocytogenes EDGe. Nanofiber scaffolds of HA-containing Cef may be used in dressings to control postoperative infections.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000269a","authors":["Jayesh J. Ahire","Leon M. T.
