Symptoms include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility. The purpose of this study is to assess the correlation between some relevant factors and symptoms and risk of an endometriosis diagnosis in infertile women.\nA retrospective study of 1282 surgical patients in an infertility Institute, Iran between 2011 and 2013 were evaluated by laparoscopy. Of these, there were 341 infertile women with endometriosis (cases) and 332 infertile women with a normal pelvis (comparison group). Chi-square and t tests were used to compare these two groups. Logistic regression was done to build a prediction model for an endometriosis diagnosis.\nGravidity [odds ratio (OR): 0.8, confidence interval (CI): 0.6-0.9, P=0.01], parity (OR: 0.7, CI: 0.6-0.9, P=0.01), family history of endometriosis (OR: 4.9, CI: 2.1-11.3, P<0.001), history of galactorrhea (OR: 2.3, CI: 1.5-3.5, P=0.01), history of pelvic surgery (OR: 1.9, CI: 1.3-2.7, P<0.001), and shorter menstrual cycle length (OR: 0.9, CI: 0.9-0.9, P=0.04) were associated with endometriosis. Duration of natural menstruation and age of menarche were not correlated with subsequent risk of endometriosis (P>0.05). Fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain and premenstrual spotting were more significant among late-stage endometriosis patients than in those with early-stage endometriosis and more prevalent among patients with endometriosis than that of the comparison group. In the logistic regression model, gravidity, family history of endometriosis, history of galactorrhea, history of pelvic surgery, dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dysparaunia, premenstrual spotting, fatigue, and diarrhea were significantly associated with endometriosis. However, the number of pregnancies was negatively related to endometriosis.\nEndometriosis is a considerable public health issue because it affects many women and is associated with the significant morbidity. In this study, we built a prediction model which can be used to predict the risk of endometriosis in infertile women.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5293cf058f610003e3b","authors":["Mahnaz Ashrafi","Shahideh Jahanian Sadatmahalleh","Mohammad Reza Akhoond","Mehrak Talebi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-05-06T07:14:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2008-076X"],"issue":"1","journal":"International Journal of Fertility & Sterility","last_mentioned_on":1462986927,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4845520\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4845520\/?platform=hootsuite"],"pmid":"27123195","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Royan Institute","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"11","title":"Evaluation of Risk Factors Associated with Endometriosis in Infertile Women.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-risk-factors-associated-endometriosis-infertile-women-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7684314,"mean":6.5948576928038,"rank":3979376,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2159076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7684314,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266711,"mean":11.390787237074,"rank":144923,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95586,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266711,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.5995918367347,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Evaluation of Risk Factors Associated with Endometriosis in Infertile Women","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1800699703493006&id=1636136463282665","license":"public","citation_ids":[7219192],"posted_on":"2016-05-05T09:05:53+00:00","summary":"Conclusion:\n\nEndometriosis is a considerable public health issue because it affects many women and is associated with the significant morbidity.
