Furthermore, the anatomical region reported to be painful may mislead the practitioner. Successfully treating these patients requires a careful and complete history and physical exam with appropriate provocative maneuvers. An evidence-based selection of clinical testing is also essential and should be tailored to the most likely underlying etiology. When advanced imaging does not reveal a conclusive source of pathology, electromyography (EMG) and selective injections have been shown to be useful adjuncts, although the sensitivity, specificity, and risk-reward ratio of each test must be considered. This review provides an evidence-based review of common etiologies of shoulder and neck pain and guidelines for assistance in determining the pain generator in ambiguous cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002203","authors":["Steven L.
