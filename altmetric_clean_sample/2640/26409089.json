Compound 10e was identified as an inhibitor of Itch, a HECT domain-E3 ligase. In an evaluation of in\u00a0vivo efficacy, 10e exhibited remarkable anticancer activity with TGI values of 98.3% and 100% at 25\u00a0mg\/kg and 50\u00a0mg\/kg orally daily, respectively, against human RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma xenograft. Treatment with 10e also showed a decrease of Itch level in human RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells. Thus 10e is a lead compound for further development of inhibitors targeting E3 ligase for treatment of multiple myeloma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Yi-Min Liu","Wei-Chun HuangFu","Han-Li Huang","Wei-Cheng Wu","Yi-Lin Chen","Yun Yen","Hsiang-Ling Huang","Chih-Ying Nien","Mei-Jung Lai","Shiow-Lin Pan","Jing-Ping Liou"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2017.09.011","first_seen_on":"2017-09-21T15:00:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["02235234","1768-3254"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1506006002,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28923389"],"pmid":"28923389","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"1,4-Naphthoquinones as inhibitors of Itch, a HECT domain-E3 ligase, and tumor growth suppressors in multiple myeloma","type":"article","volume":"140"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":7298014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116812,"mean":11.819935023243,"rank":95316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116812,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1170,"mean":1.864249786142,"rank":752,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1170,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":1.6646341463415,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Myeloma_Doc\/statuses\/910881312528990208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26409089],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T15:00:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Z.
