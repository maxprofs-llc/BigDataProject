Among these, 29 SBRT were performed using a FFF technique while 70 other SBRT were done using a FF technique. Median follow-up time was 12.9 months. Overall, no difference between the two groups was found except for the mean beam on time which was reduced by 3.3 to 0.9 minutes in the FFF group (p<0.001).\nWe report a low toxicity rate and a shortened beam on time in patients treated with 3D FFF SBRT for lung neoplastic lesions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["Annede, Pierre","Darreon, Julien","Benkemouche, Ahcene","Valdenaire, Simon","Tyran, Marguerite","Kaeppelin, Bertrand","Macagno, Alban","Barrou, Julien","Cagetti, Leonel Varela","Favrel, Veronique","Moureau-Zabotto, Laurence","Gonzague, Laurence","Fau, Pierre","Chargari, Cyrus","Tallet, Agnes","Salem, Naji"],"doi":"10.21873\/anticanres.11933","first_seen_on":"2017-09-21T14:00:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02507005","17917530"],"issue":"9","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1506105870,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28870945"],"pmid":"28870945","pubdate":"2017-09-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Flattening Filter Free vs. Flattened Beams for Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy","type":"article","volume":"37"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":1.35,"3m":1.35,"1m":1.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451303,"mean":7.1041024516615,"rank":4204240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4182440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451303,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":119463,"mean":11.864243926939,"rank":56649,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":61529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":119463,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1805,"mean":3.744078713969,"rank":501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1287,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1805,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.2309523809524,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrewMoghanaki\/statuses\/910866304478990336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26406586],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T14:00:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Drew Moghanaki","url":"https:\/\/www.massey.vcu.edu\/patient-care\/methods\/radiation\/clinical-division\/faculty\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/888053092075401218\/pFiaNcsk_normal.jpg","description":"MD, MPH - Radiation Oncologist, US Dept of Veterans Affairs, Associate Professor VCU Massey Cancer Center, #radonc","id_on_source":"DrewMoghanaki","tweeter_id":"1322269645","geo":{"lt":37.55376,"ln":-77.46026,"country":"US"},"followers":1403},"tweet_id":"910866304478990336"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/stuartgreen74\/statuses\/911300189448753160","license":"gnip","rt":["DrewMoghanaki"],"citation_ids":[26406586],"posted_on":"2017-09-22T18:44:30+00:00","author":{"name":"stuart green","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/540261620996259840\/oMlrxNlD_normal.jpeg","description":"Scientist","id_on_source":"stuartgreen74","tweeter_id":"970269812","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":161},"tweet_id":"911300189448753160"}]}}
