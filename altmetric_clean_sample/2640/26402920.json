Yet, there is still only limited evidence about individual and institutional best practices for fostering the use of scientific evidence in policy-making processes The present project is the first national-level attempt to (1) map and structurally analyze-quantitatively-health-relevant policy-making networks that connect evidence production, synthesis, interpretation, and use; (2) qualitatively investigate the interaction patterns of a subsample of actors with high centrality metrics within these networks to develop an in-depth understanding of evidence circulation processes; and (3) combine these findings in order to assess a policy network's \"absorptive capacity\" regarding scientific evidence and integrate them into a conceptually sound and empirically grounded framework.\nThe project is divided into two research components. The first component is based on quantitative analysis of ties (relationships) that link nodes (participants) in a network. Network data will be collected through a multi-step snowball sampling strategy. Data will be analyzed structurally using social network mapping and analysis methods. The second component is based on qualitative interviews with a subsample of the Web survey participants having central, bridging, or atypical positions in the network. Interviews will focus on the process through which evidence circulates and enters practice. Results from both components will then be integrated through an assessment of the network's and subnetwork's effectiveness in identifying, capturing, interpreting, sharing, reframing, and recodifying scientific evidence in policy-making processes.\nKnowledge developed from this project has the potential both to strengthen the scientific understanding of how policy-level knowledge transfer and exchange functions and to provide significantly improved advice on how to ensure evidence plays a more prominent role in public policies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000834","authors":["Damien Contandriopoulos","Fran\u00e7ois Beno\u00eet","Denise Bryant-Lukosius","Annie Carrier","Nancy Carter","Raisa Deber","Arnaud Duhoux","Trisha Greenhalgh","Catherine Larouche","Bernard-Simon Leclerc","Adrian Levy","Ruth Martin-Misener","Katerina Maximova","Kimberlyn McGrail","Candace Nykiforuk","Noralou Roos","Robert Schwartz","Thomas W.
