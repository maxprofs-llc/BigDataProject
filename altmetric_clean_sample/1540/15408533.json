However, there has been no examination of the effectiveness of this strategy.\nThe present study investigated the association between dementia and the discharge destination of patients in psychiatric hospitals.\nData from the National Patient Survey, which is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of inpatient care, were used. The 96,420 patients with dementia or other mental illness who were discharged from psychiatric hospitals in September of every 3 years from 1996 to 2014 were included in analyses.\nOf the 96,420 discharged patients, 13,823 had dementia as the primary disease. Of the 13,823 dementia patients, 3,865 (28.0%) were discharged to home, 3,870 (28.0%) were admitted to a facility or other care settings, 3,574 (25.9%) were admitted to another hospital, and 2,514 (18.2%) died. Patients were more likely to die in psychiatric hospital if their primary disease was dementia, and they had resided in a region that provided fewer home visits for psychiatric nursing care or had available a larger number of psychiatric hospital beds per capita.\nPsychiatric inpatient care may be ineffective as a treatment for the challenging behaviors of dementia. A community mental health system for behavior management should be constructed in parallel with a reduction in the number of hospital beds allotted for psychiatric care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ee3cf058f610002c7a","authors":["Nakanishi, Miharu","Niimura, Junko","Yamasaki, Syudo","Nishida, Atsushi"],"doi":"10.3233\/jad-160935","endpage":"8","first_seen_on":"2017-01-12T10:29:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1875-8908","1387-2877","18758908"],"journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","last_mentioned_on":1484232095,"links":["http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/articles\/journal-of-alzheimers-disease\/jad160935"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/content.iospress.com\/download\/journal-of-alzheimers-disease\/jad160935?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad160935","pmid":"28059786","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOS Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geriatrics","neurology"],"title":"Death of Dementia Patients in Psychiatric Hospitals and Regional Supply of Psychiatric Services: Study of the National Data from 1996 to 2014 in Japan","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/death-dementia-patients-psychiatric-hospitals-regional-supply-psychiatric-services-study-national-da"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":1.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8063599,"mean":6.8425680134317,"rank":3969328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4032024,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8063599,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":255059,"mean":12.78824264285,"rank":130017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":122284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":255059,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2404,"mean":14.927844361215,"rank":1892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":500,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2404,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":151,"mean":31.907746666667,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":151,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Social Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/yachu93\/statuses\/819491516670296066","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15408533],"posted_on":"2017-01-12T10:29:37+00:00","author":{"name":"\u5965\u6751\u6cf0\u4e4b","url":"http:\/\/blue.zero.jp\/yokumura\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/893796060077871104\/jFMzvctH_normal.jpg","description":"PhD (\u307e\u3093\u304d\u3064)","id_on_source":"yachu93","tweeter_id":"287456798","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":769},"tweet_id":"819491516670296066"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/chocolatta727\/statuses\/819554925302583296","license":"gnip","rt":["yachu93"],"citation_ids":[15408533],"posted_on":"2017-01-12T14:41:35+00:00","author":{"name":"chocolatte","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/868866619589537792\/dJ4OsI19_normal.jpg","description":"\u4e16\u306e\u4e2d\u3067\u8d77\u304d\u3066\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306e\u672c\u8cea\u3063\u3066\u4f55\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3063\u3066\u8003\u3048\u308b\u306e\u304c\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\u7acb\u6d3e\u3060\u306a\u3063\u3066\u601d\u3046\u304b\u305f\u3092\u52dd\u624b\u306b\u30d5\u30a9\u30ed\u30fc\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u9762\u8b58\u7b49\u5168\u7136\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u732b\u3068\u30af\u30e9\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u97f3\u697d\u597d\u304d\u3002\u3068\u308d\u304f\u3066\u30ba\u30ec\u304c\u3061\u3002\u3054\u3081\u3093\u306a\u3055\u3044\u3002 \u30cb\u30bb\u79d1\u5b66\u53cd\u5bfe\u3002\u4e2d\u5b66\u7406\u79d1\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u79c1\u3067\u5206\u304b\u308b\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3089\u307f\u3093\u306a\u9a19\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3002 #\u305f\u3070\u3053\u7159\u5bb3\u6b7b\u306a\u304f\u305d\u3046","id_on_source":"chocolatta727","tweeter_id":"77712102","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":164},"tweet_id":"819554925302583296"}]}}
