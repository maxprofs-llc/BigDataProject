The anti stereoselectivity was complete and robust. A variety of functional groups were tolerated in the alkynoates. The two vicinally installed heteroatom substituents of the \u03b2-boryl-\u03b1-silyl acrylates and \u03b1,\u03b2-diboryl acrylates could be differentiated and transformed in a stepwise manner, allowing the synthesis of a diverse array of unsymmetrical tetrasubstituted alkenes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Kazunori Nagao"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b00305","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T20:33:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":[],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1423773056,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.5b00305"],"pmid":"25675093","pubdate":"2015-02-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Anti-Selective Vicinal Silaboration and Diboration of Alkynoates through Phosphine Organocatalysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/antiselective-vicinal-silaboration-diboration-alkynoates-through-phosphine-organocatalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4751646,"mean":5.7094676731992,"rank":3978045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4751646,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170121,"mean":8.8193118034331,"rank":137220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170121,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3013,"mean":3.373109561753,"rank":2726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3013,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113,"mean":1.4152678571429,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
