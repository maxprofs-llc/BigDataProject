Sexually mature specimens of P. geometra were bred under laboratory conditions and fed on Danio rerio. After copulation, the specimens laid cocoons. The material for our studies were non-feeding juveniles collected just after hatching, non-feeding adult specimens, and leeches that had been fed with fish blood (D. rerio) only once ad libitum. The fed leeches were prepared for our studies during feeding and after 1, 3, 7, and 14\u00a0days (not sexually mature specimens) and some weeks after feeding (the sexually mature). Autophagy in all regions of the endodermal part of the digestive system, including the esophagus, the crop, the posterior crop caecum (PCC), and the intestine was observed in the adult non-feeding and feeding specimens. In fed specimens, autophagy occurred at very high levels-in 80 to 90\u00a0% of epithelial cells in all four regions. In contrast, in adult specimens that did not feed, this process occurred at much lower levels-about 10\u00a0% (esophagus and intestine) and about 30\u00a0% (crop and PCC) of the midgut epithelial cells. Apoptosis occurred in the feeding adult specimens but only in the crop and PCC. However, it was absent in the non-feeding adult specimens and the specimens that were collected during feeding. Moreover, neither autophagy nor apoptosis were observed in the juvenile, non-feeding specimens. The appearance of autophagy and apoptosis was connected with feeding on toxic blood. We concluded that autophagy played the role of a survival factor and was involved in the protection of the epithelium against the products of blood digestion. Quantitative analysis was prepared to determine the number of autophagic and apoptotic cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033cc","authors":["M M Rost-Roszkowska","P \u015awi\u0105tek","I Poprawa","W Rupik","E Swad\u017aba","M Kszuk-Jendrysik"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00709-015-0774-9","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:46:03+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1615-6102"],"journal":"Protoplasma","last_mentioned_on":1423653006,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25666305?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25666305","pubdate":"2015-02-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"Ultrastructural analysis of apoptosis and autophagy in the midgut epithelium of Piscicola geometra (Annelida, Hirudinida) after blood feeding.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ultrastructural-analysis-apoptosis-autophagy-midgut-epithelium-piscicola-geometra-annelida-hirudinid"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":3975062,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169714,"mean":8.8192775921706,"rank":136953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169714,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244,"mean":1.4132510288066,"rank":144,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":1.484375,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
