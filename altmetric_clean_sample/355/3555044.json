Also a high priority is the communication of information about drug safety issues to the widest possible professional and general audiences in order to improve patient safety and welfare. The publication of the two parts of the publication Viewpoint represents a pioneering effort to provide easily accessible information on international pharmacovigilance for lay and specialist readers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002737","authors":["Hugman B"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:40:00+00:00","issns":["0114-5916"],"issue":"7","journal":"Drug Safety","last_mentioned_on":1422230400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15963009"],"pmid":"15963009","pubdate":"2005-06-21T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["drugtherapy"],"title":"From the Uppsala monitoring centre: a review of viewpoint part 1 and part 2.","type":"article","volume":"28","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uppsala-monitoring-centre-review-viewpoint-part-1-part-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4652878,"mean":5.6496183853583,"rank":1120183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2945073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4652878,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163821,"mean":8.9338221462582,"rank":48739,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":112895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163821,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":555,"mean":4.0494909747292,"rank":156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":555,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":2.4657894736842,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
