The method permits the non-destructive interrogation of painted layers in situations where conventional Raman microscopy is not applicable due to high turbidity of the top layer(s). The concept is demonstrated by recovering the pure Raman spectra of paint sub-layers that are completely obscured by paint over-layers. Potential application areas include the analysis of paintings in art preservation and restoration avoiding the cross-sectional analysis used currently with this type of samples. The technique also holds promise for the development as a non-destructive subsurface tool for in situ analysis using portable instruments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022e8","doi":"10.1366\/13-07376","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T22:45:23+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Applied Spectroscopy","last_mentioned_on":1401376801,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/sas\/sas\/2014\/00000068\/00000006\/art00013","http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/sas\/sas\/2014\/00000068\/00000006\/art00013;jsessionid=1s48wqrl6ojmr.alexandra"],"pmid":"25014725","pubdate":"2014-07-12T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"title":"Subsurface Raman analysis of thin painted layers.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/subsurface-raman-analysis-thin-painted-layers"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.544,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.544},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4729227,"mean":5.5465942099605,"rank":334372,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4394881,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4729227,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162761,"mean":9.0010630621775,"rank":17915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":144846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162761,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":2.014,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":99},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
