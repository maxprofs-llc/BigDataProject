To establish a sensitive reverse transcription PCR assay to detect micrometastasis in blood containing several cancer types, we first investigated Uroplakin II (UP II), a novel molecular marker for human transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, in 25 types of normal organs. In our study, UP II mRNA was detected in 10 types of organs, including bladder, kidney, lung and pancreas, but was not detected in normal lymph nodes or leukocytes. The data indicated evidence of UP II expression in various types of normal tissues by RT-nested PCR analysis. UP II mRNA was detected in 2 of 11 (18.2%) peripheral blood samples from lung cancer patients with no metastasis, and in 5 of 12 (41.7%) peripheral blood samples of lung cancer patients with metastasis. UP II was also detected in 6 of 16 (37.5%) peripheral blood samples of patients with pancreatic cancer. The data are particularly important in that the molecular detection of micrometastasis in the blood by means of UP II mRNA identification is feasible for UP II-positive neoplasms, including lung and pancreatic cancers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f61000837e","authors":["Hiroyuki Hirata","Hisashi Hisatomi","Mutsushi Kawakita","Kumi Nagao","Shigeki Yamamoto","Kazumasa Hikiji","Takaaki Nakamoto","Hiroshi Harasawa","Noboru Kaneko","Tadashi Matsuda","Masahiro Yamamoto","Taichi Kanamaru"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:15:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1021-335X"],"issue":"4","journal":"Oncology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1198593280,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12792753"],"pmid":"12792753","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Genetic detection for hematogenous micrometastasis in patients with various types of malignant tumors using Uroplakin II derived primers in polymerase chain reaction.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-detection-hematogenous-micrometastasis-patients-various-types-malignant-tumors-using-uroplak"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":817322,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287530,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95099,"mean":8.1576508654232,"rank":24677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69334,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95099,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":798,"mean":1.658243412798,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":798,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":1.1335820895522,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"UPK2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180108429#altmetric_citation_10","license":"public","citation_ids":[3553868,3553871],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T14:34:40+00:00","summary":"Uroplakin-2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the UPK2 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14881680","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
