To assess the effect of HMG-14 on transcription by RNA polymerase II, in vivo-assembled chromatin with elevated amounts of HMG-14 was obtained. Here it is shown that HMG-14 enhanced transcription on chromatin templates but not on DNA templates. This protein stimulated the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II but not the level of initiation of transcription. These findings suggest that the association of HMG-14 with nucleosomes is part of the cellular process involved in the generation of transcriptionally active chromatin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"1994Sci...265..796D","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","authors":["HF Ding","S Rimsky","SC Batson","M Bustin","U Hansen"],"doi":"10.1126\/science.8047885","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T22:14:44+00:00","issns":["1095-9203","0036-8075"],"journal":"Science","last_mentioned_on":1197987432,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1126\/science.8047885","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8047885"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/content\/265\/5173\/796.full.pdf","pmid":"8047885","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation by chromosomal protein HMG-14.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stimulation-rna-polymerase-ii-elongation-chromosomal-protein-hmg14-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9285227185855,"rank":815661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2280061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93551,"mean":7.2559435595939,"rank":23730,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93551,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27813,"mean":21.000551920035,"rank":15017,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":7225,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27813,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":91.325596,"rank":436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":64,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
