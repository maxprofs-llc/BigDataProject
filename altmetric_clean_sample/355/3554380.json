By immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we found that SMP30 was in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of cultured mouse hepatocytes. By a homology search, we found that a domain of the SMP30 sequence 51 amino acid residues long was 60-66% similar to bacterial and yeast RNA polymerases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006c94","authors":["Akihito Ishigami","Setsuko Handa","Naoki Maruyama","Prakash C Supakar","Ishigami, Akihito","Handa, Setsuko","Maruyama, Naoki","Supakar, Prakash C"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:27:12+00:00","issns":["0916-8451"],"issue":"1","journal":"Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1438722355,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12619687"],"pmid":"12619687","pubdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Crop And Pasture Production","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Nuclear localization of senescence marker protein-30, SMP30, in cultured mouse hepatocytes and its similarity to RNA polymerase.","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nuclear-localization-senescence-marker-protein30-smp30-cultured-mouse-hepatocytes-similarity-rna-pol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5441926,"mean":6.3368881750487,"rank":1375770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3444724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5441926,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190926,"mean":8.8450019641222,"rank":57505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":130676,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190926,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":864,"mean":2.7459304750869,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":469,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":864,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":0.4609375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":96}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
