We have recently described the isolation of a protein p20-CGGBP that binds sequence-specifically to the double-stranded trinucleotide repeat 5'-d(CGG)-3' (Deissler, H., Behn-Krappa, A., and Doerfler, W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4327-4334). We demonstrate now that the p20-CGGBP can also bind to an interrupted repeat sequence. Peptide sequence tags of p20-CGGBP obtained by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry were screened against an expressed sequence tag data base, retrieving a clone that contained the full-length coding sequence for p20-CGGBP. A bacterially expressed fusion protein p20-CGGBP-6xHis exhibits a binding pattern to the double-stranded 5'-d(CGG)n-3' repeat similar to that of the authentic p20-CGGBP. This novel protein lacks any overall homology to other known proteins but carries a putative nuclear localization signal. The p20-CGGBP gene is conserved among mammals but shows no homology to non-vertebrate species. The gene encoding the sequence for the new protein has been mapped to human chromosome 3.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["H Deissler","M Wilm","B Gen\u00e7","B Schmitz","T Ternes","F Naumann","M Mann","W Doerfler"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:25:59+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"27","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1198573892,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9201980"],"pmid":"9201980","pubdate":"1997-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Rapid protein sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry and cDNA cloning of p20-CGGBP.
