Biol. Chem. 264: 8260-8270, 1989). Its role in SR function is unknown. In this report, the gene encoding human HRC was localized to human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7 by hybridization of a human HRC cDNA fragment to a panel of somatic cell hybrids. Known synteny between a portion of human chromosome 19 and a portion of mouse chromosome 7 and in situ hybridization of a biotin-labeled HRC probe to human chromosomes suggest a localization to a region corresponding to 19q13.3. The locus for myotonic dystrophy resides in the region 19q13.2-13.3. Therefore, we considered HRC, a muscle-specific gene, to possibly represent a \"candidate gene\" for myotonic muscular dystrophy. As a first step toward localizing HRC in relation to the myotonic dystrophy locus, we report the cloning of the human HRC gene, its intron-exon organization, and characterization of several informative polymorphisms to be used in future linkage studies in families with myotonic dystrophy. Of particular interest is an Alu-associated poly-d(GA) sequence located in an intron in the middle of the gene, and two stretches of acidic amino acids in the coding region of exon 1 that vary in length among different individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["S L Hofmann","M Topham","C L Hsieh","U Francke"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T20:37:27+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"4","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1199557563,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2037293"],"pmid":"2037293","pubdate":"1991-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"cDNA and genomic cloning of HRC, a human sarcoplasmic reticulum protein, and localization of the gene to human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cdna-genomic-cloning-hrc-human-sarcoplasmic-reticulum-protein-localization-gene-human-chromosome-19"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816607,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289736,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95320,"mean":8.1764194127091,"rank":24763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95320,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3834,"mean":2.7103709887816,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3834,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"HRC (gene)","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=182344846#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3552312,3552313],"posted_on":"2008-01-05T18:26:03+00:00","summary":"Sarcoplasmic reticulum histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HRC gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15062551","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
