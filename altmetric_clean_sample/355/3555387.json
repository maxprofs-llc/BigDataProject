Immunologic evaluation of a young man with autoimmune enterocolopathy and unexplained infections revealed evidence of immunodeficiency, including IgG subclass deficiency, impaired Ag-induced lymphocyte proliferation, reduced cytokine production by CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and decreased numbers of NK cells. Genetic evaluation identified haploinsufficiency of NFAT5, a transcription factor regulating immune cell function and cellular adaptation to hyperosmotic stress, as a possible cause of this syndrome. Inhibition or deletion of NFAT5 in normal human and murine cells recapitulated several of the immune deficits identified in the patient. These results provide evidence of a primary immunodeficiency disorder associated with organ-specific autoimmunity linked to NFAT5 deficiency.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6283cf058f610007cc7","authors":["Brigid S Boland","Christella E Widjaja","Asoka Banno","Bing Zhang","Stephanie H Kim","Samantha Stoven","Michael R Peterson","Marilyn C Jones","H Irene Su","Sheila E Crowe","Jack D Bui","Samuel B Ho","Yoshinaga Okugawa","Ajay Goel","Eric V Marietta","Mahdieh Khosroheidari","Kristen Jepsen","Jose Aramburu","Cristina L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez","William J Sandborn","Joseph A Murray","Olivier Harismendy","John T Chang","Boland BS","Widjaja CE","Banno A","Zhang B","Kim SH","Stoven S","Peterson MR","Jones MC","Su HI","Crowe SE","Bui JD","Ho SB","Okugawa Y","Goel A","Marietta EV","Khosroheidari M","Jepsen K","Aramburu J","L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez C","Sandborn WJ","Murray JA","Harismendy O","Chang JT"],"doi":"10.4049\/jimmunol.1401463","endpage":"2560","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:48:03+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","nci"],"issns":["1550-6606","0022-1767"],"issue":"6","journal":"The Journal of Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1423652754,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25667416?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25667416","pubdate":"2015-02-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"2551","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Immunodeficiency and Autoimmune Enterocolopathy Linked to NFAT5 Haploinsufficiency.","type":"article","volume":"194","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunodeficiency-autoimmune-enterocolopathy-linked-nfat5-haploinsufficiency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747790,"mean":5.7056333468087,"rank":3975029,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747790,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169714,"mean":8.8192325160716,"rank":136954,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169714,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5844,"mean":2.40787232586,"rank":5263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5844,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270,"mean":2.2928029739777,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
