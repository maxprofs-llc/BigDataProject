Other conditions in which fluctuating fatigue occurs are caused by abnormal ion channels in the cell membrane. These include genetically determined channelopathies, e.g. hypokalemic periodic paralysis, episodic ataxia type 2 and acquired conditions such as neuromyotonia, myasthenic syndromes, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies. Our hypothesis is that abnormal ion channel function underlies the symptoms of CFS and this is supported also by the finding of abnormal cardiac-thallium201 SPECT scans in CFS, similar to that found in syndrome X, another disorder of ion channels. CFS and syndrome X can have identical clinical symptoms. CFS may begin after exposure to specific toxins which are known to produce abnormal sodium ion channels. Finally, in CFS, increased resting energy expenditure (REE) occurs, a state influenced by transmembrane ion transport. The hypothesis that ion channels are abnormal in CFS may help to explain the fluctuating fatigue and other symptoms.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008126","authors":["Chaudhuri, A","Watson, W S","Pearn, J","Behan, P O","A.
