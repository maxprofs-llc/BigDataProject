Lesions of the airway epithelial barrier frequently observed in chronic respiratory inflammatory diseases are repaired through proliferation, migration and differentiation of epithelial cells. Our work is focused on the effects of IL-13 in human cellular models of airway epithelial cell regeneration. We have previously shown that IL-13 altered epithelial cell polarity during mucociliary differentiation of human nasal epithelial cells. In particular, the cytokine inhibited ezrin expression and interfered with its apical localization during epithelial cell differentiation in vitro. Here we show that CFTR expression is enhanced in the presence of the cytokine, that two additional CFTR protein isoforms are expressed in IL-13-treated cells and that part of the protein is retained within the endoplasmic reticulum. We further show that aquaporin 5 expression, a water channel localized within the apical membrane of epithelial cells, is completely abolished in the presence of the cytokine. These results show that IL-13 interferes with ion and water channel expression and localization during epithelial regeneration and may thereby influence mucus composition and hydration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","doi":"10.1016\/j.yexcr.2007.02.035","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T21:36:13+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1198546981,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.yexcr.2007.02.035","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17553491"],"pmid":"17553491","pubdate":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Interleukin-13 interferes with CFTR and AQP5 expression and localization during human airway epithelial cell differentiation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/interleukin13-interferes-cftr-aqp5-expression-localization-during-human-airway-epithelial-cell-diffe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":817579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286812,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94999,"mean":8.1305013158173,"rank":24638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69273,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94999,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":2.2707886497065,"rank":55,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":1.23125,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
