Using complementation cloning, we have identified a human cDNA that corrects the defect in anchor biosynthesis and allows the expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in Ltk- cells. The nucleotide sequence predicts a novel cytosolic protein of 188 amino acids.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["T Kamitani","H M Chang","C Rollins","G L Waneck","E T Yeh"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T22:52:27+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"28","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1207779759,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8407896"],"pmid":"8407896","pubdate":"1993-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Correction of the class H defect in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis in Ltk- cells by a human cDNA clone.","type":"article","volume":"268","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/correction-class-h-defect-glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor-biosynthesis-ltk-cells-human-cdna-clon"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95200,"mean":8.1703173562749,"rank":24719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95200,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6440892264898,"rank":1754,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
