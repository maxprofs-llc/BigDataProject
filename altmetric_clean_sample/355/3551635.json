HUT2 transcripts were restricted to the kidney and the HUT2 polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated with blood group Kidd-related antibodies (anti-Jk3) in coupled transcription-translation assays. Functional expression studies in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that HUT2-mediated urea transport was not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) which, however, inhibited the urea flux mediated by HUT11. These findings demonstrate that at least two distinct urea transporters are present in human tissues. By in situ hybridization, the gene encoding HUT2 has been assigned to chromosome 18q12.1-q21-1, as found previously for the Kidd\/urea transporter HUT11, suggesting that both genes evolved from duplication of a common ancestor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100028b7","doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00425-5","first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T20:20:28+00:00","issns":["0014-5793"],"journal":"Febs Letters","last_mentioned_on":1200371888,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793(96)00425-5","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8647271"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.febsletters.org\/article\/0014579396004255\/pdf","pmid":"8647271","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Molecular characterization of a new urea transporter in the human kidney.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/molecular-characterization-new-urea-transporter-human-kidney"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":817004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95226,"mean":8.1711252087164,"rank":24729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69411,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95226,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3393,"mean":2.6194451650943,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":875,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3393,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":1.3653846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
