Autoantibodies with restricted reactivity to cytoplasmic compartments and structures are an occasional incidental finding following routine examination of serum for antinuclear antibody reactivity. A prerequisite for rational exploitation of self-reactive antibodies, in either clinical or research settings, is the establishment of the molecular identity of the target autoantigen(s). Here we report on the identification of a novel autoantigen that co-localizes with a subset of cytoplasmic microbodies marked by ABCD3 (PMP-70) and\/or PXF (PEX19). Immunoscreening a HeLa cell cDNA expression library with a human autoimmune serum identified two clones that encode fragments of limkain b1 (LKAP). We demonstrate that mouse polyclonal antibodies raised against a bacterially expressed fragment of limkain b1 mark the same cytoplasmic structures as human serum, as does an EGFP:LKAPCT429 fusion protein expressed in HeLa cells. An immunoblot screen against a bacterially expressed MBP:LKAPCT429 fusion protein substrate, using a cohort of 16 additional human sera that display Hep 2 cell cytoplasmic staining patterns similar to the prototype serum, identified three additional sera reactive to limkain b1. This is the first report establishing the molecular identity of a peroxisomal autoantigen. Preliminary results suggest that limkain b1 may be a relatively common target of human autoantibodies reactive to cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002548","authors":["Dunster, K.","Lai, F.
