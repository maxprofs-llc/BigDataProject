The human ILBP amino acid sequence exhibited 78% identity to the rat ILBP sequence. Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of approx. 0.6 kb in small intestine, but no hybridization to liver, spleen, thymus, prostate, ovary, caecum, or colon. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids revealed that the human ILBP gene resides on chromosome 5 and is not linked to any other known fatty acid-binding protein family member.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["P Oelkers","P A Dawson"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-12T22:54:38+00:00","issns":["0006-3002"],"issue":"2","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)","last_mentioned_on":1198155058,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7619861"],"pmid":"7619861","pubdate":"1995-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning and chromosomal localization of the human ileal lipid-binding protein.","type":"article","volume":"1257","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-chromosomal-localization-human-ileal-lipidbinding-protein"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":816004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2293994,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95846,"mean":8.2188348061977,"rank":25013,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69733,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95846,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852,"mean":2.5373840560893,"rank":255,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":1372,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":0.90077669902913,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":102,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":98}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"FABP6","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=179171718#altmetric_citation_3","license":"public","citation_ids":[3558772,3558775],"posted_on":"2007-12-20T12:50:58+00:00","summary":"Fatty acid binding protein 6, ileal (gastrotropin), also known as FABP6, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FABP6 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14800883","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
