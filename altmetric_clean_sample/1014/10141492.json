Here, we present a case of a child with glioblastoma, who was treated postoperatively by a combination of temozolomide, irradiation, and bevacizumab. AT\/RT was diagnosed as a secondary tumor, 2.5 years following primary diagnosis. The child died 13 months after the diagnosis of AT\/RT. This case demonstrates that malignant gliomas may give rise to AT\/RT. It also emphasizes the diagnostic value of a repeated tumor biopsy in the recurrence setting.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Bozzai, Barbara","Hasselblatt, Martin","Tur\u00e1nyi, Eszter","Fr\u00fchwald, Michael C.","Siebert, Reiner","Bens, Susanne","Schneppenheim, Reinhard","Kool, Marcel","Stelczer, G\u00e1bor","Hortob\u00e1gyi, Tibor","Hauser, Peter","Fr\u00fchwald, Michael C"],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.26173","endpage":"99","first_seen_on":"2016-07-30T23:57:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1545-5017"],"issue":"1","journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1474574393,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/pbc.26173&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27472468Atypical"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.26173\/pdf","pmid":"27472468","pubdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"96","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor arising in a malignant glioma.","type":"article","volume":"64","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/atypical-teratoidrhabdoid-tumor-arising-malignant-glioma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4250241,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3951479,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260425,"mean":12.017456854975,"rank":130162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":119571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260425,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2195,"mean":2.5733609845032,"rank":894,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":1064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2195,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.2581081081081,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
