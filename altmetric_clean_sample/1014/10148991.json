In Germany legislature demands measures of quality management for in- and out-patient facilities and, in 2003, the Germany Working Group on the Diabetic Foot defined and developed a certification procedure for diabetic foot centers to be recognized as \"specialized\". This includes a description of management facilities, treatment procedures and outcomes, as well as the organization of mutual auditing visits between the centers. Outcome data is collected at baseline and 6- months on 30 consecutive patients. By 2014 almost 24.000 cases had been collected and analysed. Since 2005 Belgian multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinics could apply for recognition by health authorities. For continued recognition diabetic foot clinics need to treat at least 52 patients with a new foot problem (Wagner 2 or more or active Charcot foot) per annum. Baseline and 6-months outcome data of these patients are included in an audit-feedback initiative. Although originally fully independent of each other, the common goal of these two initiatives is quality improvement of national diabetic foot care and hence exchanges between systems has commenced. In future, the German and Belgian accreditation models might serve as templates for comparable initiatives in other countries. Just recently the IWGDF initiated a working group for further discussion of accreditation and auditing models (IWGDF AB(B)A Working Group).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005888","authors":["Morbach, Stephan","Kersken, Joachim","Lobmann, Ralf","Nobels, Frank","Doggen, Kris","Van Acker, Kristien"],"doi":"10.1002\/dmrr.2752","endpage":"325","first_seen_on":"2016-07-31T08:59:13+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1520-7560"],"issue":"S1","journal":"Diabetes\/Metabolism Research & Reviews","last_mentioned_on":1490165400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/dmrr.2752","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dmrr.2752\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/dmrr.2752\/pdf","pmid":"26455588","pubdate":"2016-01-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"318","subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"The German and Belgian accreditation models for diabetic foot services","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/german-belgian-accreditation-models-diabetic-foot-services"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8396916,"mean":7.0724322720827,"rank":4483096,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2337216,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8396916,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260027,"mean":12.024551698676,"rank":141770,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":93329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260027,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":3.3487873134328,"rank":292,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
