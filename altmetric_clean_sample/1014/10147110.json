Blood glucose monitoring system accuracy is essential for providing appropriate intensive insulin therapy and achieving tight glycemic control in critically ill patients. Unfortunately, few comparison studies have been performed to evaluate the clinical impact of accurate blood glucose monitoring system monitoring in the high-risk pediatric burn population.\nRetrospective analysis of an electronic health record system.\nPediatric burn ICU at an academic medical center.\nChildren (aged < 18 yr) with severe burns (\u2265 20% total body surface area) receiving intensive insulin therapy guided by either a noncorrecting (blood glucose monitoring system-1) or an autocorrecting blood glucose monitoring system (blood glucose monitoring system-2).\nPatient demographics, insulin rates, and blood glucose monitoring system measurements were collected. The frequency of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability was compared between the two blood glucose monitoring system groups. A total of 122 patient charts from 2001 to 2014 were reviewed. Sixty-three patients received intensive insulin therapy using blood glucose monitoring system-1 and 59 via blood glucose monitoring system-2. Patient demographics were similar between the two groups. Mean insulin infusion rates (5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8\u2009U\/hr; n = 535 paired measurements vs 2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009U\/hr; n = 511 paired measurements; p < 0.001), glycemic variability, and frequency of hypoglycemic events (90 vs 12; p < 0.001) were significantly higher in blood glucose monitoring system-1-treated patients. Compared with laboratory measurements, blood glucose monitoring system-2 yielded the most accurate results (mean \u00b1 SD bias: -1.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009mg\/dL [-0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 mmol\/L] vs 7.4\u2009\u00b1\u200913.5\u2009mg\/dL [0.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 mmol\/L]). Blood glucose monitoring system-2 patients achieve glycemic control more quickly (5.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3 vs 13.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009hr; p < 0.001) and stayed within the target glycemic control range longer compared with blood glucose monitoring system-1 patients (85.2% \u00b1 13.9% vs 57.9% \u00b1 29.1%; p < 0.001).\nAccurate autocorrecting blood glucose monitoring system optimizes intensive insulin therapy, improves tight glycemic control, and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability. The use of an autocorrecting blood glucose monitoring system for intensive insulin therapy may improve glycemic control in severely burned children.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008484","authors":["Tran, Nam K.","Godwin, Zachary R.","Steele, Amanda N.","Wolf, Steven E.","Palmieri, Tina L."],"doi":"10.1097\/pcc.0000000000000877","first_seen_on":"2016-07-31T06:57:59+00:00","funders":["niehs","nhlbi"],"issns":["1529-7535"],"journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1469948161,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Impact_of_Accurate_Point_of_Care_Glucose.98788.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Impact_of_Accurate_Point_of_Care_Glucose.98788.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/9000\/00000\/Clinical_Impact_of_Accurate_Point_of_Care_Glucose.98788.pdf","pmid":"27472251","pubdate":"2016-07-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare","pediatrics"],"title":"Clinical Impact of Accurate Point-of-Care Glucose Monitoring for Tight Glycemic Control in Severely Burned Children.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/pccmjournal\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Clinical_Impact_of_Accurate_Point_of_Care_Glucose.98788.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-impact-accurate-pointofcare-glucose-monitoring-tight-glycemic-control-severely-burned-child"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161363,"mean":6.8964925866473,"rank":5914490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":1957564,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161363,"percentile":23},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257480,"mean":11.991674800663,"rank":167436,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":74862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257480,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2106,"mean":2.4371391923991,"rank":1152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2106,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116,"mean":3.5395652173913,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
