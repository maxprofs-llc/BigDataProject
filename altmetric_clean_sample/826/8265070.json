The term \"overlap syndrome\" has been increasingly used to identify such patients and is useful in terms of clarifying prognosis and facilitating disease management. This article reviews overlap syndrome in autoimmune rheumatic disease, with particular emphasis on the associated serological markers.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d02","authors":["E Jury","D D'Cruz","W Morrow"],"doi":"10.1136\/jcp.54.5.340","endpage":"347","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T21:30:39+00:00","issns":["0021-9746","00219746"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Clinical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1464202540,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1731435\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1731435\/pdf\/v054p00340.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1731435","pmid":"11328831","pubdate":"2001-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"340","subjects":["pathology"],"title":"Autoantibodies and overlap syndromes in autoimmune rheumatic disease","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/autoantibodies-overlap-syndromes-autoimmune-rheumatic-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7757128,"mean":6.6329627680391,"rank":5869514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1045249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7757128,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268890,"mean":11.432890412028,"rank":187733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":44846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268890,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1702,"mean":4.3579788359788,"rank":1367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1702,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":2.6743902439024,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
