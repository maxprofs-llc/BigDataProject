As the results of studies on this issue are controversial, we conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis of eligible studies on this putative association.\nThe authors revised the relationship between NAT2 polymorphisms and the risk of developing PD using several databases, and performed a meta-analysis using the software Meta-Disc1.1.1. In addition heterogeneity between studies was analyzed. A description of studies regarding gene-gene interactions and gene-environmental interactions involving NAT2 polymorphisms is also made.\nDespite several recent meta-analyses showing an association between several polymorphisms in genes related with detoxification mechanisms such as cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), and glutathione transferases M1 and T1 (GSTM1, and GSTT1), data on NAT2 gene polymorphisms obtained from the current meta-analysis do not support a major association with PD risk, except in Asian populations. However, data from many studies are incomplete and therefore insufficient data exists to draw definitive conclusions. Several studies suggesting gene-gene and gene-environmental factors involving NAT2 gene in PD risk await confirmation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073c2","authors":["Jim\u00e9nez-Jim\u00e9nez, F\u00e9lix Javier","Alonso-Navarro, Hortensia","Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn, Elena","Ag\u00fandez, Jos\u00e9 A G","F\u00e9lix Javier Jim\u00e9nez-Jim\u00e9nez"],"doi":"10.1080\/17425255.2016.1192127","first_seen_on":"2016-05-25T21:03:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1744-7607","1742-5255"],"journal":"Expert Opinion on Drug Metabolism & Toxicology","last_mentioned_on":1465171348,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27216438?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/17425255.2016.1192127?ai=1lm3u&mi=ianpxd&af=R"],"pmid":"27216438","pubdate":"2016-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["metabolism"],"title":"\n              NAT2\n              polymorphisms and risk for Parkinson\u2019s disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inat2i-polymorphisms-risk-parkinsons-disease-systematic-review-metaanalysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":3892160,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3770211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269369,"mean":11.439102514032,"rank":133934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":124641,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269369,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":698,"mean":2.159962697274,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":698,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.6025217391304,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NeuroGen_papers\/statuses\/735537733297274880","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8261269],"posted_on":"2016-05-25T18:27:15+00:00","author":{"name":"NeuroGenetics papers","url":"http:\/\/neurogeneticslab.wordpress.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/508573077727223808\/P7-OnZSA_normal.png","description":"Twitterbot from @TheGBLab!
