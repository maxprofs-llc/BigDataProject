Two upstream kinases have been reported to activate AMPK in cell-free assays, i.e., the tumor suppressor LKB1 and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase. However, evidence that this is physiologically relevant currently only exists for LKB1. We now report that there is a significant basal activity and phosphorylation of AMPK in LKB1-deficient cells that can be stimulated by Ca2+ ionophores, and studies using the CaMKK inhibitor STO-609 and isoform-specific siRNAs show that CaMKKbeta is required for this effect. CaMKKbeta also activates AMPK much more rapidly than CaMKKalpha in cell-free assays. K(+)-induced depolarization in rat cerebrocortical slices, which increases intracellular Ca2+ without disturbing cellular adenine nucleotide levels, activates AMPK, and this is blocked by STO-609. Our results suggest a potential Ca(2+)-dependent neuroprotective pathway involving phosphorylation and activation of AMPK by CaMKKbeta.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067cf","doi":"10.1016\/j.cmet.2005.05.009","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:31:51+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Cell Metabolism (Science Direct)","last_mentioned_on":1198579474,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.cmet.2005.05.009","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16054095"],"pmid":"16054095","pubdate":"2005-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta is an alternative upstream kinase for AMP-activated protein kinase.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calmodulindependent-protein-kinase-kinase-alternative-upstream-kinase-ampactivated-protein-kinase"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633425,"mean":4.921826751301,"rank":815883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633425,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96038,"mean":8.2402194987351,"rank":25084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69850,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96038,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":896,"mean":13.440274860335,"rank":396,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":450,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":896,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":17.753588235294,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":8,"Researcher":30,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Student  > Ph.
