THW is composed of 193 aa, exhibits four putative transmembrane domains and does not reveal any homology to other proteins. Down-regulation of THW is correlated with metastatic capacity of melanoma cell lines. THW was down-regulated in mammary carcinoma cell lines compared with cell lines derived from non-malignant mammary epithelium, in pancreas cell lines derived from metastases compared with a cell line derived from a primary tumor and in several tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. The function of THW as a tumor suppressor is emphasized by the location of the THW gene on chromosome 6q. LOH for this region has been reported in malignant melanoma and prostate, pancreas, uterine and mammary carcinomas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a66","authors":["T Hildebrandt","J Preiherr","N Tarb\u00e9","S Klostermann","G N Van Muijen","U H Weidle"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T16:10:54+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0250-7005"],"issue":"5A","journal":"Anticancer Research: International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment","last_mentioned_on":1199595942,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11062687"],"pmid":"11062687","pubdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Identification of THW, a putative new tumor suppressor gene.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-thw-putative-new-tumor-suppressor-gene"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":817565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95022,"mean":8.127129560834,"rank":24648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95022,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":935,"mean":3.0713468950749,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":935,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84,"mean":1.2722891566265,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"PERP","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=182468570#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3508795],"posted_on":"2008-01-06T05:05:42+00:00","summary":"p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PERP gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15074903","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
