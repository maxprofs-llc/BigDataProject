It is detected at lower levels in certain stromal cell lines, but it is not detected in most other cell lines tested, indicating that it represents a differentially expressed function rather than a ubiquitous or housekeeping function. This mRNA was readily detected in samples derived from most human organs as might be expected for a gene expressed in the vascular wall. Sequencing of the 5 kb mRNA reveals its identity with 3.5 kb of previously published testis-derived cDNA sequence called testican (Alliel et al., 1993). Differential expression of this gene by endothelial cells contributes a new perspective on the potential function of testican.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c0e","authors":["H S Marr","M A Basalamah","C J Edgell"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:51:26+00:00","issns":["1062-3329"],"issue":"3","journal":"Endothelium","last_mentioned_on":1198571445,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9272383"],"pmid":"9272383","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Endothelial cell expression of testican mRNA.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endothelial-cell-expression-testican-mrna"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630112,"mean":4.9307700568987,"rank":816212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630112,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95578,"mean":8.1944880881386,"rank":24869,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95578,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":2.03125,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
