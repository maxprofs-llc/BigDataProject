We recovered four mutually exclusive 5'-untranslated exons (exon 1a to exon 1d) that map to a 1.8-kb region of genomic DNA located approximately 70 kb upstream of the first coding exon. The same 5'-untranslated exons are expressed in central, peripheral and sympathetic nervous system and in embryonic and adult brain. A 4.8-kb genomic fragment containing these 5' exons demonstrated promoter activity in transfected MN-1 cells. In transgenic mice, transcription of the 4.8-kb promoter was restricted to brain and spinal cord. The 4.8-kb promoter contains eight consensus Sp1-binding sites and two Inr sites. A potential NRSE\/RE-1 site is located nearby. Two active polyadenylation sites identified by 3'-RACE are conserved in human, mouse, and chicken SCN8A. Sequence comparison of human and mouse SCN8A identified 12 conserved noncoding elements whose effect on transcription was tested in transfected cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","doi":"10.1016\/j.ygeno.2004.09.002","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:35:59+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1199564477,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ygeno.2004.09.002","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15676283"],"pmid":"15676283","pubdate":"2005-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Multiple transcripts of sodium channel SCN8A (Na(V)1.6) with alternative 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions and initial characterization of the SCN8A promoter.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multiple-transcripts-sodium-channel-scn8a-nav16-alternative-5-3untranslated-regions-initial-characte"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9280690829525,"rank":815952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93834,"mean":7.282771626187,"rank":23840,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93834,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":2.7132646137787,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
