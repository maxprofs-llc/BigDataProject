They bind to a common ligand B71\/2 (CD80\/86), however with different avidities. Unlike CD28 which augments the T-cell response, CTLA-4 operates predominately as a negative regulator of T-cell proliferation. The mechanism by which CTLA-4 can generate these intracellular signals is unclear. Little is known regarding the identity of the protein-tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for CTLA-4 phosphorylation and thus creating conditions for the reported binding to PI 3-kinase and the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. In this study, we demonstrate that Rlk (resting lymphocyte kinase) is capable of phosphorylating CTLA-4 at the YVKM motif. Consistent with this finding, Rlk is capable of providing conditions for the binding of the SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase to the receptor. CTLA-4 is therefore the first known substrate for Rlk suggesting the possibility that this kinase may participate in CTLA-4 function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","authors":["Helga Schneider","Pamela L Schwartzberg","Christopher E Rudd","Schneider, H","Schwartzberg, P L","Rudd, C E"],"doi":"10.1006\/bbrc.1998.9559","endpage":"19","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:08:15+00:00","issns":["0006291X","0006-291X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1198554819,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1006\/bbrc.1998.9559","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9813138"],"pmid":"9813138","pubdate":"1998-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"14","title":"Resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk\/Txk) phosphorylates the YVKM motif and regulates PI 3-kinase binding to T-cell antigen CTLA-4.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0006291X98995596","volume":"252","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resting-lymphocyte-kinase-rlktxk-phosphorylates-yvkm-motif-regulates-pi-3kinase-binding-tcell-antige"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4681522,"mean":5.6990934027662,"rank":1130572,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2962293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4681522,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164697,"mean":9.0187932797398,"rank":49180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":113316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164697,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6682,"mean":2.506361921868,"rank":328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":2354,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6682,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200,"mean":2.1296281407035,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
