A recent genome-wide association study reported that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs5984894) in the gene encoding Pcdh11X was associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians. In order to assess the involvement of the PCDH11X polymorphism in the risk of developing AD in Chinese, we analyzed the genotype and allele distributions of the PCDH11X rs5984894 polymorphism in a Han Chinese population (355 LOAD cases and 399 healthy controls). Our results failed to find any significant association between the tested SNP and LOAD, indicating that PCDH11X gene polymorphism does not play a major role in the genetic predisposition to LOAD in this Han Chinese population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002427","doi":"10.1016\/j.brainres.2010.08.008","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:47:28+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Brain Research","last_mentioned_on":1368356422,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.brainres.2010.08.008","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20707987"],"pmid":"20707987","pubdate":"2010-08-17T23:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Neuroscience","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Lack of association between PCDH11X genetic variation and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a Han Chinese population.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lack-association-between-pcdh11x-genetic-variation-lateonset-alzheimers-disease-han-chinese-populati-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3633255,"mean":4.9221505741186,"rank":815881,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3633255,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96025,"mean":8.240843789053,"rank":25082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96025,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2096,"mean":2.8753212410501,"rank":297,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":1044,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2096,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.7329545454545,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"PCDH11X","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=554717261#altmetric_citation_18","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503649],"posted_on":"2013-05-12T11:00:22+00:00","summary":"Protocadherin 11 X-linked, also known as PCDH11X, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the PCDH11X gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14880376","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Biotechfra","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Biotechfra"}}]}}
