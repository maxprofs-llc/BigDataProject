Four different isoforms diverging in their carboxyl terminus were isolated, corresponding to proteins encompassing 560, 610, 626, and 745 amino acids. Sequences included a signal peptide of 32 amino acids, followed by a cytokine binding domain containing four conserved cysteines, a WSDWS motif, and a region consisting of three fibronectin type III domain repeats. No immunoglobulin-like module was identified in the GPL sequences. The intracellular part of longer isoforms contained a proline-rich region defining a box1 motif for interaction with the Janus kinases. The Gpl gene is organized in 15 exons and is located on 5q11.2 in tandem with the gp130 gene. Both genes were only separated by 24 kilobases, with opposite transcriptional orientations. The GPL receptor displayed a 28% identity with gp130. Specific GPL transcripts were observed in tissues involved in reproduction. Transcripts were also found in blood cells and in bone marrow, revealing expression of GPL in all of the myelomonocytic lineage, from hematopoietic stem cells to activated dendritic cells. In monocytes and dendritic cells, expression of GPL was strongly up-regulated by interferon-gamma, indicating a possible involvement of GPL in Th1-type immune responses. The molecular basis of cell signaling mediated by GPL was studied using chimeric receptors where external portions of alpha or beta interleukin-5 receptor subunits were fused to the internal portion of GPL or of related receptors. Results indicated that association of GPL to the intracellular portions of gp130, or LIF receptor, allowed the signaling cascade.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Caroline Diveu","Eric Leli\u00e8vre","David Perret","Anne-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Lagrue Lak-Hal","Josy Froger","Catherine Guillet","Sylvie Chevalier","Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau","Amy Wesa","Laurence Preisser","Marie Chabbert","Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gauchat","Anne Galy","Hugues Gascan","Alain Morel"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.m307286200","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T16:47:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"50","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1200168663,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.M307286200","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14504285"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/278\/50\/49850.full.pdf","pmid":"14504285","pubdate":"2003-12-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"GPL, a novel cytokine receptor related to GP130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor.","type":"article","volume":"278","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gpl-novel-cytokine-receptor-related-gp130-leukemia-inhibitory-factor-receptor-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629179,"mean":4.9362043867828,"rank":816618,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2289698,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629179,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95338,"mean":8.1724793102365,"rank":24769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95338,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6419912271317,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
