In this paper, we analyze a particular stretch of 69 kb centromeric to the HLA-J gene, in which we identify 21 different mRNAs mainly expressed in testis, and characterize five different transcription units, HZFw, HZFc, HCGV, HTEX6, and HTEX4. These tightly linked genes form a cluster conserved between human and mouse and displaying a high gene density of about one every 14 kb. Alternative splicing processes are observed for all the genes, together with an alternative polyadenylation event for gene HTEX4, sense\/antisense mRNA overlaps for HZFw and HZFc, for HZFw and HCGV at their 3' end, and for HTEX6 and HTEX4 at their 5' end. This complex genomic structure suggests a mechanism of coregulation by cis-interaction in gene expression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037b5","authors":["O Coriton","M Lepourcelet","A Hampe","F Galibert","J Mosser"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:51:56+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0938-8990"],"issue":"12","journal":"Mammalian Genome","last_mentioned_on":1322468746,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11130983"],"pmid":"11130983","pubdate":"2000-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Transcriptional analysis of the 69-kb sequence centromeric to HLA-J: a dense and complex structure of five genes.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptional-analysis-69kb-sequence-centromeric-hlaj-dense-complex-structure-five-genes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.9206251576887,"rank":816734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96455,"mean":8.2526789972423,"rank":25266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96455,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":630,"mean":2.6338759936407,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":133,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":630,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Computer Science":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"MY":1,"AU":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ZNRD1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180098603#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503762,3503765],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T12:26:59+00:00","summary":"DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA12 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ZNRD1 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14880440","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}},{"title":"RNF39","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=204604109#altmetric_citation_4","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503762,3503765],"posted_on":"2008-04-10T02:24:33+00:00","summary":"RING finger protein 39 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RNF39 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=16856595","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}},{"title":"ZNRD1-AS1","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=462867375#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503762,3503765],"posted_on":"2011-11-28T08:25:46+00:00","summary":"In molecular biology, ZNRD1 antisense RNA 1 (non-protein coding), also known as ZNRD1-AS1 or HTEX4, is a long non-coding RNA.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=33891607","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"RE73","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:RE73"}}]}}
