This effect is believed to be one of earliest morphological changes of heart and renal failure. However, the precise molecular mechanism involved in angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy is poorly understood. In the present study we report the isolation of a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein. It encodes a 531-amino acid protein. Its mRNA is detected in all human tissues examined but highly expressed in the human kidney, pancreas, heart, and human embryonic kidney cells as well as rat vascular smooth muscle and renal proximal tubular cells. Protein synthesis and relative cell size analyzed by flow cytometry studies indicate that overexpression of the novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein induces cellular hypertrophy in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle and renal proximal tubular cells. In contrast, the hypertrophic effects was reversed in renal proximal tubular cell lines expressing the novel gene in the antisense orientation and its dominant negative mutant, which lacks the last 101 amino acids in its carboxyl-terminal tail. The hypertrophic effects are at least in part mediated via protein kinase B activation or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27(kip1) protein expression level in vascular smooth muscle, and renal proximal tubular cells. Moreover, angiotensin II could not stimulate cellular hypertrophy in renal proximal tubular cells expressing the novel gene in the antisense orientation and its mutant. These findings may provide new molecular mechanisms to understand hypertrophic agents such as angiotensin II-induced cellular hypertrophy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Deng-Fu Guo","Valerie Tardif","Karin Ghelima","John S.
