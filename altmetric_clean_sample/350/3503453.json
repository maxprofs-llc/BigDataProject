Currently, tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging provides the most accurate prognostic parameter for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the overall survival of patients with resectable tumors varies significantly, indicating the need for additional prognostic factors to better predict the outcome of the disease, particularly within a given TNM subset.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334b","authors":["Romulo M Brena","Carl Morrison","Sandya Liyanarachchi","David Jarjoura","Ramana V Davuluri","Gregory A Otterson","David Reisman","Selina Glaros","Laura J Rush","Christoph Plass","Naftali Kaminski"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040108","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:39:29+00:00","issns":["1549-1676"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1198581379,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040108","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17388669","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1831740","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosmedicine\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040108"],"pmcid":"PMC1831740","pmid":"17388669","pubdate":"2007-03-29T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Aberrant DNA Methylation of OLIG1, a Novel Prognostic Factor in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pmed.0040108","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/aberrant-dna-methylation-olig1-novel-prognostic-factor-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8314163,"mean":7.0060718583457,"rank":2125668,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5054616,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8314163,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244831,"mean":8.3908865580198,"rank":70987,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":167997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244831,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2443,"mean":51.326991809992,"rank":2036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2443,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":84.937371428571,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":13}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
