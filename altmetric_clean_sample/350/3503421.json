We recently cloned a novel SRF cofactor, termed zipzap\/p200, which is a zinc finger protein yet to be characterized. We determined that zipzap\/p200 is a 200-kDa protein with two classic C2H2 zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus where the nucleotide sequence was highly conserved among human, mouse, and rat. The zipzap gene was expressed in multiple tissues and at multiple ages, including the fetal and adult heart. The zipzap protein interacted with SRF in vivo and was found in protein complexes containing SRF and other SRF cofactors, including p49\/strap and Nkx2.5. Zipzap\/p200 activated the promoter of cardiac genes and potentiated the effect of myocardin on ANF promoter activity. Therefore, zipzap may serve as a transcription co-activator for the regulation of cardiac gene expression. Our data support the notion that a number of SRF cofactors may participate in gene regulation and thereby contribute to the delicate control of gene expression in complex biological processes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2006.05.211","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:38:01+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1198582757,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2006.05.211","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16782067"],"pmid":"16782067","pubdate":"2006-06-20T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Zipzap\/p200 is a novel zinc finger protein contributing to cardiac gene regulation.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zipzapp200-novel-zinc-finger-protein-contributing-cardiac-gene-regulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634360,"mean":4.9196455088828,"rank":815909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2296191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634360,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96239,"mean":8.2468710280764,"rank":25175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96239,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6528,"mean":2.5102644400184,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":1960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6528,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":142,"mean":1.1639432624113,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":142,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"ARID2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180095299#altmetric_citation_13","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503421],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T11:39:17+00:00","summary":"AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 2 (ARID2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ARID2 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14880024","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
