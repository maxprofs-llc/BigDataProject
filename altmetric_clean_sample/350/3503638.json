The library was screened by two synthetic oligonucleotides, one specific for IFN-alpha and one complementary to both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Rescreening the library with two full-length cDNAs encoding IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, respectively, revealed that the frequency of the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta clones reflected the activities of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta obtained by functional assays. On the cDNA level, the dominating species was identical with the type of IFN-alpha A or IFN-alpha 2; however, one new type of cDNA also was found that was similar to the previously described IFN-alpha C. Only one type of cDNA was found encoding IFN-beta, although several IFN-beta proteins have been detected in the analyzed cell line.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000ce7a","authors":["B Lund","A von Gabain","T Edlund","T Ny","E Lundgren"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:46:54+00:00","issns":["0197-8357"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of interferon research","last_mentioned_on":1198584832,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/4008999"],"pmid":"4008999","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["molecularbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Differential expression of interferon genes in a substrain of Namalwa cells.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differential-expression-interferon-genes-substrain-namalwa-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":817275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95154,"mean":8.1607395247655,"rank":24701,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69367,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95154,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.9047619047619,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"IFNA17","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180097710#altmetric_citation_6","license":"public","citation_ids":[3503637,3503638],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T12:13:52+00:00","summary":"Interferon alpha-17 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IFNA17 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14880334","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
