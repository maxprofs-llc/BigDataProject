In mammals two types of adenylyl cyclase synthesize cAMP; a ubiquitous family of transmembrane isoforms regulated by G proteins in response to extracellular signals, and a recently isolated soluble enzyme insensitive to heterotrimeric G protein modulation. Using the very sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) expression is detectable in almost all tissues examined; however, Northern analysis and in situ hybridization indicate that high levels of sAC message are unique to male germ cells. Elevated levels of sAC mRNA are first observed in pachytene spermatocytes and expression increases through spermiogenesis. The accumulation of high levels of message in round spermatids suggests sAC protein plays an important role in the generation of cAMP in spermatozoa, implying possible roles in sperm maturation through the epididymis, capacitation, hypermotility, and\/or the acrosome reaction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f6100081e9","authors":["M L Sinclair","X Y Wang","M Mattia","M Conti","J Buck","D J Wolgemuth","L R Levin"],"doi":"10.1002\/(sici)1098-2795(200005)56:1<6::aid-mrd2>3.0.co;2-m","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:46:39+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1040-452X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Reproduction and Development","last_mentioned_on":1269066086,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10737962"],"pmid":"10737962","pubdate":"2000-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Specific expression of soluble adenylyl cyclase in male germ cells.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/specific-expression-soluble-adenylyl-cyclase-male-germ-cells-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3989887,"mean":5.0352317582571,"rank":917125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2528377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3989887,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126974,"mean":9.12164314405,"rank":38633,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":86639,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126974,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":351,"mean":1.6786,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":351,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
