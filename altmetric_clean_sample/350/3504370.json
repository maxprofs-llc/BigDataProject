Sural nerve pathology revealed peculiar findings characterized by extensive minifascicular formation and with a decreased density of myelinated fibers. We found in the patient, a homozygous missense mutation at the initiating codon in exon 1 of the desert hedgehog (DHH) gene, which predicts a failure of translation of the gene. These data demonstrate that DHH is a key molecule in both male gonadal differentiation and perineurial formation in peripheral nerves.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9193cf058f61000d2b2","authors":["Fujio Umehara","Genshu Tate","Kayoko Itoh","Mitsuhiro Osame"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T13:16:03+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0145-5680"],"issue":"2","journal":"Cellular and molecular biology","last_mentioned_on":1198567723,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11990454"],"pmid":"11990454","pubdate":"2002-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Minifascicular neuropathy: a new concept of the human disease caused by desert hedgehog gene mutation.","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/minifascicular-neuropathy-new-concept-human-disease-caused-desert-hedgehog-gene-mutation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636226,"mean":4.9206251576887,"rank":816733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295940,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636226,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96455,"mean":8.2526789972423,"rank":25266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96455,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76,"mean":1.97112,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor":1,"Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Desert hedgehog protein","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180079268#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3504370],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T07:28:43+00:00","summary":"Desert hedgehog protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DHH gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14877981","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
