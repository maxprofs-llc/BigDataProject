The authors report that molecular genetic studies in seven affected family members identified a novel F318C substitution that alters a highly conserved residue in a predicted repeat domain of unknown function. This report suggests that this domain may participate in the development of the ADPEAF phenotype.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Evan Fertig","Anne Lincoln","Andrea Martinuzzi","Richard H.
