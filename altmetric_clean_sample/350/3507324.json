From those 37 (74%) revealed the wildtype sequence, 6 samples (12%) contained independent single base pair changes including 4 silent and 2 with amino acid changes. Furthermore, a triple-base pair polymorphism was found in 7 samples (14%, 4x heterozygous, 3x homozygous) leading to the following changes: F(217)S, H(248)Y, and I(250)T. Furthermore, a novel alternative splice variant concerning intron 10 was identified in 6 samples (12%). Notably, this novel isoform was only found in samples of gastric mucosa lymphocytes, whereas peripheral NK cells expressed cathepsin W wildtype only. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the fist time that a genetic variant and a novel isoform of cathepsin W are present in about 14% and 12%, respectively, within the Caucasian population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023be","doi":"10.1016\/j.bbrc.2004.07.056","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:06:04+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications","last_mentioned_on":1199396832,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bbrc.2004.07.056","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15358123"],"pmid":"15358123","pubdate":"2004-09-11T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Identification of a novel isoform predominantly expressed in gastric tissue and a triple-base pair polymorphism of the cathepsin W gene.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-novel-isoform-predominantly-expressed-gastric-tissue-triplebase-pair-polymorphism-cat"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":817647,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94968,"mean":8.121456990323,"rank":24627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94968,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6517,"mean":2.5141746470227,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6517,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":1.1375251798561,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Cathepsin W","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=181962425#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3507324],"posted_on":"2008-01-03T21:47:12+00:00","summary":"Cathepsin W is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CTSW gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=15030359","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
