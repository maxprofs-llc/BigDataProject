The 5' region is 77% identical to the 5' end of the coding region of rat POM121 and appears to represent a partial duplication of a gene encoding a human homologue of this rodent gene. The 3' end of the POM-ZP3 transcript is 99% identical to ZP3 and appears to have arisen from a duplication of the last four exons (exons 5-8) of ZP3. Using Northern blots and RT-PCR, POM-ZP3 transcripts were detected in human ovaries, testes, spleen, thymus, lymphocytes, prostate, and intestines. The longest open reading frame encodes a conceptual protein of 210 amino acids, the first 76 of which are 83% identical to residues 241-315 of rat POM121. The next 125 amino acids are 98% identical to residues 239-363 of the 424-amino-acid human ZP3 protein. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, genomic fragments of ZP3 and a human homologue of POM121 were localized to chromosome 7q11.23. Taken together, these data suggest that partial duplications of human ZP3 and a POM121-like gene have resulted in a fusion transcript, POM-ZP3, that is expressed in multiple human tissues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["S Kipersztok","G A Osawa","L F Liang","W S Modi","J Dean"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:13:22+00:00","issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"2","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1198577212,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7789967"],"pmid":"7789967","pubdate":"1995-01-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"POM-ZP3, a bipartite transcript derived from human ZP3 and a POM121 homologue.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pomzp3-bipartite-transcript-derived-human-zp3-pom121-homologue"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":815887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96244,"mean":8.2473377180679,"rank":25182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69956,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96244,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3834,"mean":2.7122942864597,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3834,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":6,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"POM121","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=180088997#altmetric_citation_2","license":"public","citation_ids":[3502803,3502806],"posted_on":"2007-12-25T10:06:52+00:00","summary":"Nuclear envelope pore membrane protein POM 121 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the POM121 gene.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=14879237","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"ProteinBoxBot","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:ProteinBoxBot"}}]}}
