The roles of 2P domain K+ channels in general anesthesia and neuroprotection have been proposed recently. We have investigated the ability of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (an active metabolite of the general anesthetic chloral hydrate (CH)) to modulate the activity of hTREK-1 and hTRAAK channels expressed heterologously in Chinese hamster ovary cells by using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Trichloroethanol potentiated hTREK-1 and hTRAAK channel activity in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. The parent compound CH also augmented the activity of both the channels reversibly. CH activation of hTREK-1 was transient followed by a rapid inhibition, whereas hTRAAK activation was not followed by inhibition. Deletions of the carboxy terminal domain (Delta89, Delta100 and Delta119) of hTREK-1 did not abolish sensitivity to TCE (20 mM) suggesting that C-terminal tail is not essential for the activation of hTREK-1 by TCE. The hTREK-1 currents consisted of an instantaneous and a time-dependent component. The time-dependent current was reduced by trichloroethanol (20 mM). Our findings identify TREK-1 and TRAAK channels as molecular targets for trichloroethanol and suggest that activation of these channels might contribute to the CNS depressant effects of CH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a0","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2003.11.023","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:03:07+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Neuropharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1198550039,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neuropharm.2003.11.023","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14996553"],"pmid":"14996553","pubdate":"2004-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology","pharmacology"],"title":"Trichloroethanol enhances the activity of recombinant human TREK-1 and TRAAK channels.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/trichloroethanol-enhances-activity-recombinant-human-trek1-traak-channels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628597,"mean":4.9402458135364,"rank":816949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288682,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628597,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95258,"mean":8.168931648068,"rank":24743,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69429,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95258,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1174,"mean":3.0566427962489,"rank":155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1174,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":3.1071176470588,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
