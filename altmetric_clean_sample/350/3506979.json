The transmembrane CD16 receptor forms a heteromeric structure with the Fc epsilon RI (gamma) and\/or CD3 (zeta) subunits on the surface of activated monocytes\/macrophages, NK cells, and a subset of T cells. The expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD16 isoform encoded by the Fc gamma RIII-B gene is restricted to polymorphonuclear leukocytes and can be induced by Me2SO differentiation of HL60 cells. We have isolated and sequenced genomic clones of the human Fc gamma RIII-A and Fc gamma RIII-B genes, located their transcription initiation sites, identified a different organization of their 5' regions, and demonstrated four distinct classes of Fc gamma RIII-A transcripts (a1-a4) compared with a single class of Fc gamma RIII-Bb1 transcripts. Both CD16 promoters (positions -198 to -10) lack the classical \"TATA\" positioning consensus sequence but confer transcriptional activity when coupled to the human lysozyme enhancer. Both promoters also display different tissue-specific transcriptional activities reflecting the expected gene expression of Fc gamma RIII-A and Fc gamma RIII-B in NK cells versus polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Within the -198\/-10 fragments, the sequences of the two CD16 genes have been identified to differ in 10 positions. It is suggested that these nucleotide differences might contribute to cell type-specific transcription of Fc gamma RIII genes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J.
