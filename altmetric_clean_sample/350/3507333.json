This fragment was used to isolate a full length, 4.2 kb cDNA that encodes a 663 amino acid protein which we call MEF (myeloid elf-1-like factor). MEF contains a central ETS domain and is expressed in a variety of myeloid leukemia cell lines and in normal adult hematopoietic tissue such as spleen, thymus and peripheral blood, as well as non-hematopoietic tissue such as ovary, placenta and colon. Using an oligonucleotide binding selection assay, and bacterially expressed MEF, we demonstrated that MEF recognizes a consensus DNA binding sequence nearly identical to elf-1 (..WGGA..) and then showed that MEF specifically bound to known elf-1 binding sites in the human GM-CSF and IL-3 promoters. To characterize the functional effect of MEF on transcription, we performed co-transfection experiments in myeloid cells, and T cells, and demonstrated transactivation of both promoters by MEF, but not by elf-1. MEF is a new member of the elf-1\/E74 family of ETS proteins, that has DNA binding properties similar to elf-1 but distinct transcriptional activating effects in several hematopoietic cell lineages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003240","authors":["Y Miyazaki","X Sun","H Uchida","J Zhang","S Nimer"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:06:22+00:00","issns":["0950-9232"],"issue":"8","journal":"Oncogene","last_mentioned_on":1199397102,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8895518"],"pmid":"8895518","pubdate":"1996-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","neoplasms"],"title":"MEF, a novel transcription factor with an Elf-1 like DNA binding domain but distinct transcriptional activating properties.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/mef-novel-transcription-factor-elf1-like-dna-binding-domain-distinct-transcriptional-activating-prop"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627649,"mean":4.9475528391989,"rank":817576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286815,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627649,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95022,"mean":8.1270664168974,"rank":24648,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69286,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95022,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3240,"mean":2.6836585365854,"rank":263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3240,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.9825757575758,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
