Earlier we showed that the secretory TSG6 protein is a member of a family of hyaluronan-binding proteins that includes cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core protein, and the adhesion receptor CD44. In the present study we have used Southern blot analysis to demonstrate that TSG6 is a single-copy gene in the human and murine species. With the aid of a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel, TSG6 was assigned to human chromosome 2. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed that TNF produced a rapid, primary transcriptional activation of the TSG6 gene in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts. In order to learn more about the regulation of TSG6 gene expression, we cloned the TSG6 gene from a genomic library of human white blood cells. Sequencing of a 1.3-kilobase fragment of the 5'-flanking region of the TSG6 gene identified TATA-like and CAAT sequences near the transcription start site. In addition, potential binding sites for NF-IL-6, AP-1, interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-1 and -2, and glucocorticoid response elements were identified in the 5'-flanking region. A single transcription start site was identified by primer extension. Deletion analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the TSG6 DNA linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene revealed that a construct containing TSG6 DNA from positions -165 to +78 could be transcriptionally activated by interleukin(IL)-1, and to a lesser extent by TNF, upon transfection into FS-4 fibroblasts. The region that imparts inducibility by IL-1 or TNF (positions -165 to -58) contains potential binding sites for IRF-1 and -2, AP-1, and NF-IL-6. A region mediating transcriptional silencing was localized further upstream (between positions -332 and -165). The results suggest that TSG6 gene expression is regulated by an interplay of positively and negatively acting transactivating factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["T H Lee","L Klampfer","T B Shows","J Vilcek"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:19:36+00:00","issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1278226399,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8454591"],"pmid":"8454591","pubdate":"1993-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Transcriptional regulation of TSG6, a tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1-inducible primary response gene coding for a secreted hyaluronan-binding protein.","type":"article","volume":"268","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transcriptional-regulation-tsg6-tumor-necrosis-factor-interleukin1inducible-primary-response-gene-co"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629816,"mean":4.9321920670937,"rank":816263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290857,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629816,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95470,"mean":8.1896260356767,"rank":24823,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69556,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95470,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28042,"mean":2.6409424770871,"rank":1753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9997,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28042,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4327851239669,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
