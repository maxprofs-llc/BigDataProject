It is inherited in either an autosomal dominant (AD) or autosomal recessive (AR) manner. The AD form of CHED has been mapped to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 20. Another endothelial dystrophy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy (PPM), has been linked to a larger but overlapping region on chromosome 20. A large, Irish, consanguineous family with AR CHED was investigated to determine if there was linkage to this region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244f","authors":["M\u00e1ire Callaghan","Collette K Hand","Susan M Kennedy","J Susan FitzSimon","Louis M T Collum","Nollaig A Parfrey"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjo.83.1.115","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:28:59+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-2079","0007-1161"],"issue":"1","journal":"British Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1198555741,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bjo.83.1.115","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10209448","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1722772"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/83\/1\/115.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1722772","pmid":"10209448","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis demonstrate that autosomal recessive congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and autosomal dominant CHED are genetically distinct","type":"article","volume":"83","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/homozygosity-mapping-linkage-analysis-demonstrate-autosomal-recessive-congenital-hereditary-endothel"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627879,"mean":4.9457436126612,"rank":817463,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2287170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627879,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95055,"mean":8.1273422686053,"rank":24657,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95055,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1383,"mean":2.3066150506512,"rank":215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":982,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1383,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":1.9018292682927,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
