The alpha 5 gene encodes a protein of 48,800 daltons (424 amino acids) which exhibits significant overall amino acid sequence identity with the previously cloned rat nAChR subunits alpha 1 (49%), alpha 2 (55%), alpha 3 (52%), and alpha 4 (49%). Features characteristic of other nAChR alpha-subunits are present such as conserved cysteine residues at positions 127, 141, 191, and 192, and four strongly hydrophobic domains. A second addition to the nAChR-related gene family, designated beta 4, is encoded in overlapping rat genomic clones lambda DD15 and lambda RG518A. The beta 4 gene, encoding a mature protein of 53,300 daltons (475 amino acids), consists of 6 exons and has a transcription unit length of approximately 18 kilobase pairs. The beta 4 gene encoded protein shows considerable amino acid sequence identity with nAChR beta 1 (43%), beta 2 (64%), and beta 3 (44%) subunits. Northern blots showed that, along with alpha 3 and beta 2, transcripts for both the alpha 5 and beta 4 genes are present in the PC12 cell line, while in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated expression of the alpha 5 and beta 4 genes in a small number of nuclei in the central nervous system. Finally, the genes that encode the beta 4, alpha 3, and alpha 5 proteins are transcribed with convergent polarities and form a tightly linked gene cluster spanning approximately 60 kilobase pairs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["J Boulter","A O'Shea-Greenfield","R M Duvoisin","J G Connolly","E Wada","A Jensen","P D Gardner","M Ballivet","E S Deneris","D McKinnon"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T10:31:40+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0021-9258"],"issue":"8","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1197967347,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/1689727"],"pmid":"1689727","pubdate":"1990-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Alpha 3, alpha 5, and beta 4: three members of the rat neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related gene family form a gene cluster.","type":"article","volume":"265","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/3-5-4-three-members-rat-neuronal-nicotinic-acetylcholine-receptorrelated-gene-family-form-gene-clust"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":816557,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2294987,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96323,"mean":8.2421959884555,"rank":25209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":70006,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96323,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28045,"mean":2.6410731707317,"rank":1751,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":9971,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28045,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243,"mean":2.4358842975207,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
