A recent study revealed that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs175174, which has potential effects on splicing, in intron 4 of the ZDHHC8 gene is associated with susceptibility to patients with schizophrenia in US and South Africa. We examined three SNPs of the ZDHHC8 gene, including rs175174, by case-control association in Japanese patients with BPD (N=172) and controls (N=298) or patients with schizophrenia (N=407) and controls (N=497). No significant association with BPD or schizophrenia was observed. After stratification by subcategories, bipolar I and II of BPD, and paranoid and disorganized types of schizophrenia, no significant association was found, nor was a significant association with either disorder found after dividing by gender. These data suggest that the ZDHHC8 gene may not be associated with susceptibility to BPD or schizophrenia, at least in a Japanese population.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2005.08.019","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T16:39:30+00:00","issns":[],"journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1199586303,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.neulet.2005.08.019","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16150541"],"pmid":"16150541","pubdate":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The ZDHHC8 gene did not associate with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zdhhc8-gene-not-associate-bipolar-disorder-schizophrenia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628496,"mean":4.94108381299,"rank":817060,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2288427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628496,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95232,"mean":8.1665639970179,"rank":24733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69413,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95232,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1759,"mean":2.6187656427759,"rank":207,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":990,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1759,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67,"mean":1.1439393939394,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
