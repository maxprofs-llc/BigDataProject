Certain PH domains drive signal-dependent membrane recruitment of their host proteins by binding strongly and specifically to lipid second messengers produced by agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-Ks). We describe X-ray crystal structures of two different PH domains bound to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, the head group of the major PI 3-K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. One of these PH domains (from Grp1) is PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 specific, while the other (from DAPP1\/PHISH) binds strongly to both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and its 5'-dephosphorylation product, PtdIns(3,4)P2. Comparison of the two structures provides an explanation for the distinct phosphoinositide specificities of the two PH domains and allows us to predict the 3-phosphoinositide selectivity of uncharacterized PH domains.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037ba","authors":["Ferguson, K M","Kavran, J M","Sankaran, V G","Fournier, E","Isakoff, S J","Skolnik, E Y","Lemmon, M A"],"doi":"10.1016\/s1097-2765(00)00037-x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T11:39:23+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1097-2765"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular Cell","last_mentioned_on":1198565333,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S1097-2765(00)00037-X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10983984"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.cell.com\/article\/S109727650000037X\/pdf","pmid":"10983984","pubdate":"2000-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology"],"title":"Structural basis for discrimination of 3-phosphoinositides by pleckstrin homology domains.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-basis-discrimination-3phosphoinositides-pleckstrin-homology-domains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627324,"mean":4.9493148749129,"rank":817691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2286276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627324,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94935,"mean":8.1222156866877,"rank":24616,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94935,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3051,"mean":4.0840793442623,"rank":755,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":1695,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3051,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":4.182,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
