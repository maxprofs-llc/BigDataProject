Samples of these tissues were collected from 26 patients with superficial (SBC) or invasive bladder cancer (IBC) and used to evaluate enzyme activity and gene expression by northern blot analysis. In keeping with the electrophoretic pattern and the expression level of the respective genes, GI activity significantly increased in SBC samples, while it remained unchanged in IBC samples compared with the normal mucosa. In contrast, GII showed a higher activity in the tumour (either SBC or IBC samples) versus normal tissues. These results confirm the role of the glyoxalases in detoxifying cytotoxic methylglyoxal (MG) in bladder cancer. The differing levels of GI activity level and gene expression of GI between the SBC and IBC samples could help in their differential diagnosis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","authors":["E Mearini","R Romani","L Mearini","C Antognelli","A Zucchi","T Baroni","M Porena","V N Talesa"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T14:18:35+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0959-8049"],"issue":"14","journal":"European Journal of Cancer (1965)","last_mentioned_on":1198011987,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12204678"],"pmid":"12204678","pubdate":"2002-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Differing expression of enzymes of the glyoxalase system in superficial and invasive bladder carcinomas.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/differing-expression-enzymes-glyoxalase-system-superficial-invasive-bladder-carcinomas"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627150,"mean":4.9502167410311,"rank":817764,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627150,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94869,"mean":8.1113533541343,"rank":24587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94869,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":986,"mean":2.687283248731,"rank":158,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":986,"percentile":70},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.8092631578947,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
