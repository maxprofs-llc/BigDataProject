The deduced amino acid sequence of human TN-R (1358 amino acids) showed a homology to chicken and rat TN-R of 75 and 93%, respectively. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction we have studied the existence of TN-R isoforms generated by pre-mRNA alternative splicing in various human astrocytomas and meningiomas. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a human isoform in which one fibronectin-like repeat is omitted. Northern blot analysis of the poly(A)-rich RNA from different tissues showed two mRNAs having sizes of about 10 and 11 kilobases. Using DNA from a panel of human-hamster and human-mouse somatic cell hybrids and by fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have assigned the gene for human TN-R to the region 1q23-q24. The mouse mutation loop-tail (Lp), which has been proposed as a model for human neural tube defects, maps to region of mouse chromosome 1 syntenic with human 1q23-q24.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Barbara Carnemolla","Alessandra Leprini","Laura Borsi","Germano Querz\u00e9","Stefania Urbini","Luciano Zardi","Carnemolla, B","Leprini, A","Borsi, L","Querz\u00e9, G","Urbini, S","Zardi, L"],"doi":"10.1074\/jbc.271.14.8157","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T13:37:26+00:00","issns":["1083-351X","0021-9258"],"issue":"14","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1486863719,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1074\/jbc.271.14.8157","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8626505","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8626505"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jbc.org\/content\/271\/14\/8157.full.pdf","pmid":"8626505","pubdate":"2015-05-22T14:27:05+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Human tenascin-R.
