Associations with extrarenal symptoms have been reported, mainly with Leber amaurosis (termed Senior-L\u00f8ken syndrome). By means of linkage analysis a gene NPH1 for the purely renal form of NPH has been localized to chromosome 2. Genetic heterogeneity has been shown between NPH and Senior-L\u00f8ken syndrome and also within the group of isolated NPH cases. Further characterization of the NPH1 region led to the isolation of large homozygous deletions in approximately 70% of patients with NPH. The detection of these deletions by PCR represents a simple noninvasive method for precise diagnosis in the majority of patients suspected of having NPH.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e63","authors":["M Konrad","S Saunier","J Calado","M C Gubler","M Broyer","C Antignac"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T10:36:29+00:00","issns":["0946-2716"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1197963733,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9587065"],"pmid":"9587065","pubdate":"1998-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Familial juvenile nephronophthisis.","type":"article","volume":"76","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/familial-juvenile-nephronopahisis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":817795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285791,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94851,"mean":8.1086428044281,"rank":24578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69183,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94851,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"mean":3.2587096774194,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":342,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":3.975,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Ph.
