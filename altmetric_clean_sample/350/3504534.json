The product, which consists of 785 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 88.2 kDa, possesses His and Cys domains that are highly conserved in all members of the ubiquitin-specific processing (UBP) family of proteases. Recombinant USP1 protein showed genuine UBP activity, correctly cleaving Ub-beta-galactosidase to produce ubiquitin and beta-galactosidase. Chromosomal mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid analyses localized the USP1 gene to the p31.3-p32.1 band of chromosome 1. As losses of heterozygosity or amplifications have been observed in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 1 in some neuroblastomas, breast cancers, and pancreatic adenocarcinomas, the USP1 gene may be a candidate for either the tumor-suppressive or the oncogenic activities associated with that chromosomal region.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002945","authors":["T Fujiwara","A Saito","M Suzuki","H Shinomiya","T Suzuki","E Takahashi","A Tanigami","A Ichiyama","C H Chung","Y Nakamura","K Tanaka"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T13:23:02+00:00","issns":["0888-7543"],"issue":"1","journal":"Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1198593356,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9806842"],"pmid":"9806842","pubdate":"1998-11-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Identification and chromosomal assignment of USP1, a novel gene encoding a human ubiquitin-specific protease.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-chromosomal-assignment-usp1-novel-gene-encoding-human-ubiquitinspecific-protease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9287830669226,"rank":815430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278699,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93377,"mean":7.221985306717,"rank":23683,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93377,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3833,"mean":2.7132646137787,"rank":95,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":553,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3833,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.8321176470588,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
