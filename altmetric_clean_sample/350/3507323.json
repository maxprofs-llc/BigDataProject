The ORF in the cDNA clone for human AK2B predicted a protein comprising 232 amino acids (25.6 kDa). The features of AK2A and AK2B sequences in human were the same as those in the bovine system. Each of the recombinant proteins, AK2A and AK2B, was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the purified recombinant proteins were enzymatically active. The distribution of AK2 transcripts in various human tissues was examined by Northern analysis. Unlike in the bovine system, it was found that the AK2A transcript was the major form of AK2 mRNA species in all human tissues. The transcripts of AK2 isozymes were relatively abundant in heart, liver, and also in skeletal muscle, where the expression level of AK2 was known to be low. Western blot analysis of AK isozymes in human heart and skeletal muscle revealed that AK2 protein was found only in heart, whereas AK1 was detected in both tissues. These tissue-specific expressions of the AK isozymes in human might suggest the presence of organ-specific regulation of the AK2 gene including a post-transcriptional control in skeletal muscle.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52a3cf058f610003f81","authors":["Younghee Lee","Jae Wha Kim","Sang Min Lee","Hyo Joon Kim","Kwang Soo Lee","Chankyu Park","In Seong Choe"],"doi":"10.1093\/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021915","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:06:00+00:00","issns":["0021-924X"],"journal":"Journal of Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1199396624,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021915","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9504408"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jb.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/123\/1\/47.full.pdf","pmid":"9504408","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Cloning and expression of human adenylate kinase 2 isozymes: differential expression of adenylate kinase 1 and 2 in human muscle tissues.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cloning-expression-human-adenylate-kinase-2-isozymes-differential-expression-adenylate-kinase-1-2-hu"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3624912,"mean":4.9388872667219,"rank":817352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2285029,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3624912,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94556,"mean":7.7923187562795,"rank":24253,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":69211,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94556,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":649,"mean":2.4431604938272,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":173,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":649,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":0.88636363636364,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"AK2","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=181961492#altmetric_citation_7","license":"public","citation_ids":[3507323],"posted_on":"2008-01-03T21:43:44+00:00","summary":"Adenylate kinase 2 is an enzyme is encoded in humans by the AK2 gene.
