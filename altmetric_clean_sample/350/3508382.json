After deproteinization, cross-linked RNAs were resolved by gel electrophoresis and identified as anomalously migrating species by Northern blotting. In addition to the U4\/U6 snRNA cross-link, we detected an intermolecular U2\/U6 cross-link, as well as several apparently intramolecular U1, U2, and U5 cross-links. Photoreversal of the U2\/U6 cross-link with 254 nm irradiation released stoichiometric amounts of U2 and U6 snRNA. To localize the U2\/U6 cross-link, the 3' end of U2 in the purified U2\/U6 complex was labeled selectively using a novel oligonucleotide \"splint\" technique. The labeled U2\/U6 complex was then subjected to rapid enzymatic RNA sequencing or to targeted digestion of the U2 and U6 components of the complex by RNase H and a panel of complementary oligonucleotides. The U2\/U6 cross-link is located upstream of nucleotide 15 in U2 and downstream of nucleotide 85 in U6, suggesting that the phylogenetically conserved base-pairing between these regions (6 consecutive base pairs in human, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans, 7 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Trypanasoma brucei, 8 in Pisum sativum, 11 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is significant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f61000293c","authors":["T P Hausner","L M Giglio","A M Weiner"],"doi":"10.1101\/gad.4.12a.2146","first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T15:53:12+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1549-5477","0890-9369"],"issue":"12A","journal":"Genes & Development","last_mentioned_on":1199595129,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1101\/gad.4.12a.2146","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2176635"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/genesdev.cshlp.org\/content\/4\/12a\/2146.full.pdf","pmid":"2176635","pubdate":"1990-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Evidence for base-pairing between mammalian U2 and U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles.","type":"article","volume":"4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-basepairing-between-mammalian-u2-u6-small-nuclear-ribonucleoprotein-particles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632901,"mean":4.9227823810231,"rank":815879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2295050,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632901,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95993,"mean":8.240116405534,"rank":25063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69827,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95993,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2543,"mean":3.0114185680566,"rank":459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2543,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":5.0839285714286,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
