Using an experimental system, called the elimination test, we previously identified a 1 Mb segment, the common eliminated region 1 (C3CER1). C3CER1 was also covered by a PAC contig. Using the sequence of two overlapping PACs from C3CER1, we localized the human KIAA0028 cDNA, encoding the precursor of mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase. We also characterized a novel human LIM domain-containing gene (LIMD1) and its mouse ortholog (Limd1). LIM domains consist of a cysteine-rich consensus sequence containing two distinct zinc-binding subdomains, which mediate protein-protein interactions. The predicted protein sequences of the human and mouse genes reveal three LIM domains located at the C-terminal end, which indicates that they belong to the group 3 of the gene family encoding LIM motifs. We characterized the genomic structure of the human LIMD1 gene and assigned the mouse Limd1 gene to the chromosome 9F subtelomeric region. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed at the mRNA level. The LIM motif has been previously identified in many developmentally important factors from various eukaryotes. These factors have been shown to play a role in intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation and cellular differentiation during development. The human C3CER1-located LIMD1 gene should therefore be further studied for its possible role in tumor suppression.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002a0d","authors":["H Kiss","D Kedra","Y Yang","M Kost-Alimova","C Kiss","K P O'Brien","I Fransson","G Klein","S Imreh","J P Dumanski"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-11T12:40:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0340-6717"],"issue":"6","journal":"Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1200375227,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10647888"],"pmid":"10647888","pubdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"A novel gene containing LIM domains (LIMD1) is located within the common eliminated region 1 (C3CER1) in 3p21.3.","type":"article","volume":"105","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-gene-containing-lim-domains-limd1-located-within-common-eliminated-region-1-c3cer1-3p213"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":816184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2292377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95731,"mean":8.2100435600128,"rank":24953,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95731,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1753,"mean":3.3475947488584,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1753,"percentile":22},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.0928571428571,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
