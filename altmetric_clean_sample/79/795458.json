Large-scale first-generation technology sequencing projects have expedited molecular epidemiology studies at an unprecedented scale for two pathogenic RNA viruses chosen as models: influenza A virus and dengue. Next-generation sequencing approaches are now leading to a more in-depth analysis of virus genetic diversity, which is greater for RNA than DNA viruses because of high replication rates and the absence of proofreading activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In the field of virus discovery, technological advancements and metagenomic approaches are expanding the catalogs of novel viruses by facilitating our probing into the RNA virus world.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e5","authors":["Vivien G Dugan","Kazima Saira","Elodie Ghedin"],"doi":"10.2217\/fvl.12.45","endpage":"573","first_seen_on":"2012-06-16T13:47:50+00:00","funders":["niaid","phs"],"issns":["1746-0794","1746-0808"],"issue":"6","journal":"Future Virology","last_mentioned_on":1369151910,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/fvl.12.45"],"pmid":"23682295","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"563","title":"Large-scale sequencing and the natural history of model human RNA viruses","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/largescale-sequencing-natural-history-model-human-rna-viruses-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419631,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69818,"mean":5.1730912528467,"rank":26114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":41557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69818,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":1.4389285714286,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.45,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
