Stable isotope data are presented here from a case where for the first time stable isotope based intelligence aided victim identification by DNA analysis and subsequent apprehension of the perpetrators thus demonstrating that it is possible in principal for stable isotope data of present-day people to be useful for human provenancing, i.e. to yield valuable information about a person's life history and geographic origin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5f53cf058f610005ead","authors":["Meier-Augenstein, Wolfram","Fraser, Isla"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.scijus.2007.10.010","endpage":"159","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T19:18:50+00:00","issns":["1355-0306","13550306"],"issue":"3","journal":"Science & Justice","last_mentioned_on":1468932157,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18953804","http:\/\/www.scienceandjusticejournal.com\/article\/S1355-0306(07)00114-1\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.scijus.2007.10.010"],"pmid":"18953804","pubdate":"2008-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"153","subjects":["jurisprudence"],"title":"Forensic isotope analysis leads to identification of a mutilated murder victim","type":"article","volume":"48","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/forensic-isotope-analysis-leads-identification-mutilated-murder-victim"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8088896,"mean":6.8703833603893,"rank":1574523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6479489,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8088896,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95841,"mean":5.6592151919867,"rank":17632,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":77792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95841,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":281,"mean":4.1965428571429,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":281,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.425,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
