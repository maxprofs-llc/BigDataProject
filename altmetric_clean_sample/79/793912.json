The efficacy of fotemustine (FTM) has been demonstrated in phase II clinical trials; however, these papers report a wide range of progression-free-survival (PFS-6 m) rates, ranging from 21% to 52%. We investigated whether FTM could have a different response pattern in respect to time to adjuvant temozolomide failure, or whether specific independent risk factors could be responsible for the wide range of response rates observed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000865","authors":["Alessandro Paccapelo","Alessandro Paccapelo","Ivan Lolli","Maria Grazia Fabrini","Giovanni Silvano","Beatrice Detti","Franco Perrone","Giuseppina Savio","Matteo Santoni","Erminio Bonizzoni","Tania Perrone","Silvia Scoccianti"],"doi":"10.1186\/1479-5876-10-90","first_seen_on":"2012-06-15T13:43:41+00:00","issns":["","1479-5876"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1339767000,"links":["http:\/\/www.translational-medicine.com\/content\/10\/1\/90\/abstract"],"pmid":"22583678","pubdate":"2012-05-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"90","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A retrospective pooled analysis of response patterns and risk factors in recurrent malignant glioma patients receiving a nitrosourea-based chemotherapy","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-pooled-analysis-response-patterns-risk-factors-recurrent-malignant-glioma-patients-rec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2742399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":729520,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73405,"mean":4.5703038798975,"rank":48196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":19828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73405,"percentile":27},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1024,"mean":2.644211143695,"rank":525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1024,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.1541935483871,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
