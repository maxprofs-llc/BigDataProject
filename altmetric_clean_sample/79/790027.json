They are the medium through which we do a lot of communicating with the outside world: our ideas, of course, and also our emotions and our personality. The voice is the very emblem of the speaker, indelibly woven into the fabric of speech. In this sense, each of our utterances of spoken language carries not only its own message but also, through accent, tone of voice and habitual voice quality it is at the same time an audible declaration of our membership of particular social regional groups, of our individual physical and psychological identity, and of our momentary mood. Voices are also one of the media through which we (successfully, most of the time) recognize other humans who are important to us-members of our family, media personalities, our friends, and enemies. Although evidence from DNA analysis is potentially vastly more eloquent in its power than evidence from voices, DNA cannot talk. It cannot be recorded planning, carrying out or confessing to a crime. It cannot be so apparently directly incriminating. As will quickly become evident, voices are extremely complex things, and some of the inherent limitations of the forensic-phonetic method are in part a consequence of the interaction between their complexity and the real world in which they are used. It is one of the aims of this article to explain how this comes about. This subject have unsolved questions, but there is no direct way to present the information that is necessary to understand how voices can be related, or not, to their owners.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8203cf058f61000bc50","doi":"10.4103\/0976-9668.95933","first_seen_on":"2012-06-13T11:16:23+00:00","issns":["2229-7707"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Natural Science, Biology, and Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1339586179,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22690044?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22690044","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Voice - How humans communicate?","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/voice-humans-communicate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3108489,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":987025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76540,"mean":4.8644041338402,"rank":49344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":18376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76540,"percentile":24},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106,"mean":3.2812380952381,"rank":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":44,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":4.9625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
