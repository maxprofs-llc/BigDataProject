We describe a unique phenotype: acute onset of myoclonus and ataxia, associated with abnormal opsoclonus-like eye movements; improvement of clinical symptoms under steroid treatment; and appearance of epileptic activity on EEG 2 years later without overt seizures. After excluding possible genetic causes, whole-genome exome sequencing was performed in order to identify the causative gene. One heterozygous missense mutation (R84W) was detected by exome sequencing and a large heterozygous deletion of exons 3 and 4 by MLPA analysis. The father is heterozygous for the R84W mutation and the mother is heterozygous for the exon 3+4 deletion. The mutation affects a highly conserved segment of the predicted protein, changing a basic amino acid into neutral. The large deletion probably results in a truncated protein. The different phenotype broadens the spectrum of KCTD7-related diseases. Therefore, patients diagnosed as having opsoclonus-myoclonus with an atypical course should be evaluated for KCTD7 mutations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e77","authors":["Blumkin L","Kivity S","Lev D","Cohen S","Shomrat R","Lerman-Sagie T","Leshinsky-Silver E"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00415-012-6545-z","first_seen_on":"2012-06-15T17:57:37+00:00","issns":["0340-5354"],"issue":"","journal":"Journal of Neurology","last_mentioned_on":1345641226,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22638565"],"pmid":"22638565","pubdate":"2012-05-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"A compound heterozygous missense mutation and a large deletion in the KCTD7 gene presenting as an opsoclonus-myoclonus ataxia-like syndrome.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/compound-heterozygous-missense-mutation-large-deletion-kctd7-gene-presenting-opsoclonusmyoclonus-ata"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":923184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":3568190,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76321,"mean":4.8936004716981,"rank":15202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":60765,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76321,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1169,"mean":2.548323630137,"rank":193,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1169,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.6779411764706,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
