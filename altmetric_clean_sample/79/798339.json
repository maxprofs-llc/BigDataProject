The aim of the study is to review the effects of \u03c9-3 PUFA supplemented as fish oil or blue fish in blood pressure. The analysis of different studies suggests that high doses \u03c9-3 PUFA ( \u2265 3 g\/day) produces a small but significant decrease in blood pressure, especially systolic blood pressure, in older and hypertensive subjects; however, the evidence is not consistent among different studies. \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids consumption might have a place in the control of patients with mild hypertension before starting drug treatment and of those who prefer changes of lifestyles like diet.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000579a","authors":["Cabo J","Alonso R","Mata P","Jorge Cabo","Rodrigo Alonso","Pedro Mata"],"doi":"10.1017\/s0007114512001584","first_seen_on":"2012-06-19T02:07:24+00:00","issns":["1475-2662","0007-1145"],"issue":"","journal":"British Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1493591863,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22591893?dopt=Citation","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/S0007114512001584","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22591893","https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/british-journal-of-nutrition\/article\/omega3-fatty-acids-and-blood-pressure\/C5B80492D2B8028AD8F95FFAAF5F44DF"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/services\/aop-cambridge-core\/content\/view\/C5B80492D2B8028AD8F95FFAAF5F44DF\/S0007114512001584a.pdf\/div-class-title-omega-3-fatty-acids-and-blood-pressure-div.pdf","pmid":"22591893","pubdate":"2012-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Omega-3 fatty acids and blood pressure.","type":"article","volume":"107 Suppl 2","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/omega3-fatty-acids-blood-pressure"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8154803,"mean":6.8922645386048,"rank":3850704,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4123149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8154803,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94240,"mean":5.7960088922845,"rank":38789,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":52719,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94240,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3553,"mean":12.270218468468,"rank":2451,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1045,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3553,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":16.589342105263,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
