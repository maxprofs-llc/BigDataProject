Home care is a complex interactive process involving the patient, family, HC assistants as well as professional care providers. Previous studies exploring patient perspectives on home care have been based mainly on patient interviews. In contrast, the present study took a broad perspective on patients' experiences and thoughts by combining field observations on care situations with patient and HC assistant interviews. The aim of the study presented in this article was to promote a new and broadened understanding of patients receiving 24-hour home care by constructing a theoretical model to illuminate their main concern.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ce","authors":["Lena Swedberg","Lena Swedberg","Eva Hammar Chiriac","Lena T\u00f6rnkvist","Ingrid Hylander"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6955-11-9","first_seen_on":"2012-06-15T14:37:40+00:00","issns":["","1472-6955"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Nursing","last_mentioned_on":1339714352,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6955\/11\/9\/abstract"],"pmid":"22697419","pubdate":"2012-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"9","title":"Patients in 24-hour home care striving for control and safety","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patients-24hour-home-care-striving-control-safety"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630978,"mean":4.9279868812221,"rank":2898960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630978,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73411,"mean":4.5629382917858,"rank":53497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":389,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73411,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":133,"mean":3.1661212121212,"rank":118,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":133,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":1.175,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"SE":1,"BR":1,"GB":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Patients in 24-hour home care striving for control and safety","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=188271744635560&id=284207211627261","citation_ids":[794044],"posted_on":"2012-06-14T22:52:32+00:00","summary":"Home care is a complex interactive process involving the patient, family, HC assistants as well as professional care providers.\nConclusions\n\nThe results accentuate the importance to patients of participating in their own care, especially in the selection o","author":{"name":"Grupo de Interesse em Fisioterapia Cardio-Respirat\u00f3ria","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/284207211627261","facebook_wall_name":"Grupo de Interesse em Fisioterapia Cardio-Respirat\u00f3ria","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/284207211627261\/picture","id_on_source":"284207211627261"}}]}}
