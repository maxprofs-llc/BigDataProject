This was achieved by a two-step magnetic enrichment which allowed the mass collection of environmental magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) virtually free of nonmagnetic contaminants. Four fosmid libraries were constructed and screened by end sequencing and hybridization analysis using heterologous magnetosome gene probes. A total of 14 fosmids were fully sequenced. We identified and characterized two fosmids, most likely originating from two different alphaproteobacterial strains of MTB that contain several putative operons with homology to the magnetosome island (MAI) of cultivated MTB. This is the first evidence that uncultivated MTB exhibit similar yet differing organizations of the MAI, which may account for the diversity in biomineralization and magnetotaxis observed in MTB from various environments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100022c6","authors":["Jogler C","Lin W","Meyerdierks A","Kube M","Katzmann E","Flies C","Pan Y","Amann R","Reinhardt R","Sch\u00fcler D"],"doi":"10.1128\/aem.02701-08","first_seen_on":"2012-06-16T05:25:40+00:00","issns":["0099-2240"],"issue":"12","journal":"Applied & Environmental Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1339824333,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19395570"],"pmcid":"PMC2698345","pmid":"19395570","pubdate":"2009-04-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Toward cloning of the magnetotactic metagenome: identification of magnetosome island gene clusters in uncultivated magnetotactic bacteria from different aquatic sediments.","type":"article","volume":"75","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toward-cloning-magnetotactic-metagenome-identification-magnetosome-island-gene-clusters-uncultivated"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627970,"mean":4.9447382433571,"rank":2017799,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627970,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":67067,"mean":4.7965761488682,"rank":31196,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":24370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":67067,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3357,"mean":3.6993152562574,"rank":1863,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3357,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":3.5417142857143,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
