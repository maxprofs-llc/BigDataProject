The sequencing of the kangaroo genome provides an opportunity to use comparative analyses to compare the HOX clusters of a mammal with a distinct body plan to those of other mammals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Hongshi Yu","James Lindsay","Zhi-Ping Feng","Stephen Frankenberg","Yanqiu Hu","Dawn Carone","Geoff Shaw","Andrew J Pask","Rachel O\u2019Neill","Anthony T Papenfuss","Marilyn B Renfree","Yu H","Lindsay J","Feng ZP","Frankenberg S","Hu Y","Carone D","Shaw G","Pask AJ","O'Neill R","Papenfuss AT","Renfree MB"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-251","first_seen_on":"2012-06-18T09:50:49+00:00","issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1340012948,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/251\/abstract"],"pmid":"22708672","pubdate":"2012-06-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"251","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Evolution of coding and non-coding genes in HOX clusters of a marsupial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2164-13-251","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evolution-coding-noncoding-genes-hox-clusters-marsupial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628014,"mean":4.9445414826282,"rank":2904816,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75156,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628014,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72314,"mean":4.6692973324298,"rank":53077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72314,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3347,"mean":3.3201811117753,"rank":2682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3347,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":3.2193098591549,"rank":100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
