This review discusses recent findings regarding what factors influence physicians and patients or their surrogates in these decisions and considers whether futility arguments regarding life-sustaining treatments should be abandoned.\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation is one paradigm in the literature for studying end-of-life decision-making. Outcomes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation are poor, and physicians tend to over-rely on tacit versus evidence-based knowledge for resuscitation decisions. Physician decisions are often inherently biased regarding elderly and intellectually impaired patients. Patient decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments are poorly understood by physicians, and also include inherent bias against the elderly and intellectually impaired. Although patients and their decision-makers frequently incorporate religious or spiritual beliefs in their decisions, physicians rarely discuss these factors with them. Defining 'futility' is problematic, and futility arguments have limited utility in clinical end-of-life treatment discussions.\nFurther research is needed about factors that affect both physicians and patients with regard to forgoing life-sustaining interventions. Physicians need more information regarding religious\/spiritual preferences of patients and decision-makers. 'Futility' arguments in end-of-life decision-making are flawed and should probably be abandoned.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000585c","authors":["Van Norman, Gail A."],"doi":"10.1097\/aco.0000000000000436","first_seen_on":"2017-03-18T11:02:15+00:00","issns":["0952-7907"],"issue":"2","journal":"Current opinion in anaesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1489834843,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-anesthesiology\/Abstract\/2017\/04000\/Decisions_regarding_forgoing_life_sustaining.9.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/co-anesthesiology\/2017\/04000\/Decisions_regarding_forgoing_life_sustaining.9.pdf","pmid":"27906720","pubdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"211","subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Decisions regarding forgoing life-sustaining treatments","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/co-anesthesiology\/Fulltext\/2017\/04000\/Decisions_regarding_forgoing_life_sustaining.9.aspx","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decisions-regarding-forgoing-lifesustaining-treatments"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":7244341,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266874,"mean":13.133961247484,"rank":220776,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266874,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":855,"mean":2.3000140515222,"rank":806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":855,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.6645,"rank":26,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
