Its induced expression in several cancer types correlates with poor prognosis. Apart from the functional and transcriptional regulatory aspects of S100A4, its post-transcriptional regulation is not yet clearly elucidated. In this study, we show that microRNAs (miR) miR-505-5p and miR-520c-3p target the 3'-UTR of S100A4 and inhibits its expression and its mediated migration and invasion. 5-Aza treatment significantly increased miR-520c-3p expression and reduced the S100A4 protein amounts. The upstream promoter region of miR-520c is hypermethylated irrespective of the metastasis status of colorectal cancer (CRC) patient tissues and in all analyzed CRC cell lines. Moreover, in a cohort of CRC patient specimen (n = 59), miR-520c-3p was significantly downregulated. miR-520c-3p stably expressing HCT116 cells showed a reduced metastasis formation in livers after implanting in mice spleen. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that S100A4 is post-transcriptionally regulated by tumor suppressor miRs, miR-505c-5p and miR-520c-3p, and particularly miR-520c-3p expression is epigenetically silenced in CRC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Giridhar Mudduluru","Katharina Ilm","Steffen Fuchs","Ulrike Stein"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.15499","first_seen_on":"2017-03-18T16:01:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"13","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1492799229,"links":["http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=view&path[]=15499","http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=15499","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28423501?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=download&path%5B%5D=15499&path%5B%5D=49513","pmid":"28423501","pubdate":"2017-02-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Impact Journals","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Epigenetic silencing of miR-520c leads to induced S100A4 expression and its mediated colorectal cancer progression","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.oncotarget.com\/abstract\/15499","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-silencing-mir520c-leads-induced-s100a4-expression-mediated-colorectal-cancer-progression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085159,"mean":6.8783507387159,"rank":3798940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4106331,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085159,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":254956,"mean":13.174368943539,"rank":123102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":124571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":254956,"percentile":48},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8508,"mean":3.0989594451628,"rank":1750,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":6376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8508,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":918,"mean":3.8840632497274,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":686,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":918,"percentile":74}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
