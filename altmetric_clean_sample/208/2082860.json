Specific hosts are certain mammals. After penetrating the human organism, these parasites never mature to adult worms but can produce a lot of various symptoms which are dependent on the kind of manifestation. Perilous illnesses are described. The incidence is undoubtedly more than is realized. A new microprecipitation test has proved to be highly specific for the diagnosis. An effective nontoxic treatment in human medicine--exept for mebendazole--was not known until now. We report about the illness of a patient with all typical laboratory findings and clinical signs. The application of Fenbendazole for the first time in humans showed to be highly effective against this ubiquitous illness.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9143cf058f61000cdfe","authors":["C Wolff"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-29T15:49:14+00:00","issns":["0340-1162"],"issue":"3","journal":"Immunit\u00e4t und Infektion","last_mentioned_on":1391010405,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7095820"],"pmid":"7095820","pubdate":"1982-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["communicablediseases","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"[Visceral larva migrans.
