The lifetime dose was estimated for controls interviewed in person (N\u200a=\u200a2811, 37.5% women) of the population-based representative Northern Germany Leukemia and Lymphoma Study. Data were assessed in standardized computer-assisted personal interviews. The calculation of doses is based on a comprehensive quantification model including calendar year, sex, kind of examination, and technical development. In multivariate regression models the annual red bone marrow dose was analyzed depending on age, sex and calendar year to consider simultaneously temporal changes in radiologic practice and individual risk factors. While the number of examinations continuously rises over time, the dose shows two peaks around 1950 and after 1980. Men are exposed to higher doses than woman. Until 1970 traditional examinations like conventional and mass screening examinations caused the main dose. They were then replaced by technically advanced examinations mainly computed tomography and cardiac catheter. The distribution of the red bone marrow dose over lifetime depends highly on the technical standards and radiation protection survey. To a lesser extent it is influenced by age and sex of the subjects. Thus epidemiological studies concerning the assessment of radiation exposure should consider the calendar year in which the examination was conducted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Wolfgang Hoffmann","Merle Friederike Meiboom","Kerstin Weitmann","Claudia Tersch\u00fcren","Heiner von Boetticher"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0078027","first_seen_on":"2014-01-29T06:30:55+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"11","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1390992032,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078027"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0078027.pdf","pmid":"24244286","pubdate":"2013-11-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e78027","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Influence of Age, Sex and Calendar Year on Lifetime Accumulated Red Bone Marrow Dose from Diagnostic Radiation Exposure","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/influence-age-sex-calendar-year-lifetime-accumulated-red-bone-marrow-dose-diagnostic-radiation-expos"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6231511,"mean":5.9633357285814,"rank":2549996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":3543319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6231511,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150561,"mean":7.8638089532414,"rank":61614,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":84266,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150561,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98167,"mean":9.7553661756617,"rank":46257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":47944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98167,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8132,"mean":9.4696669536342,"rank":3352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4458,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8132,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":4,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Physics and Astronomy":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Mathematics":1,"Unspecified":1,"Environmental Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sjukhusfysik\/status\/428414771227271168","license":"public","citation_ids":[2081579],"posted_on":"2014-01-29T06:30:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Sjukhusfysiker","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000692690003\/7b77d3017e60352c6c0e3b02f0be1785_normal.jpeg","description":"En Sjukhusfysikers bild av v\u00e4rlden\/A Medical Physicist view of the world","id_on_source":"Sjukhusfysik","tweeter_id":"1890082844","followers":46},"tweet_id":"428414771227271168"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Itembu\/status\/428432995348135936","license":"public","rt":["Sjukhusfysik"],"citation_ids":[2081579],"posted_on":"2014-01-29T07:42:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Itembu Lannes","url":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/itembulannes","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1509375893\/Itembu_Cropped_normal.jpg","description":"Medical Physicist - with a background in astronomy and social work currently employed by Karolinska University Hospital.","id_on_source":"Itembu","tweeter_id":"82619416","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":91},"tweet_id":"428432995348135936"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sjukhusfysik\/status\/428477755270131712","license":"public","citation_ids":[2081579],"posted_on":"2014-01-29T10:40:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Sjukhusfysiker","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000692690003\/7b77d3017e60352c6c0e3b02f0be1785_normal.jpeg","description":"En Sjukhusfysikers bild av v\u00e4rlden\/A Medical Physicist view of the world","id_on_source":"Sjukhusfysik","tweeter_id":"1890082844","followers":46},"tweet_id":"428477755270131712"}]}}
