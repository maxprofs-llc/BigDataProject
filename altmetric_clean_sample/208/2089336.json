The relative contribution of increased airways resistance and increased parenchymal compliance to hyperinflation of each absolute lung volume is poorly understood. We hypothesized that increased residual volume (RV) and RV\/total lung capacity (TLC) would be associated with reduced airway lumen dimensions, whereas increased functional residual capacity (FRC), TLC, and reduced inspiratory capacity (IC)\/TLC would be associated with emphysema on CT scan. We examined whether clinical characteristics differed accordingly.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024fa","authors":["Benjamin M. Smith","Eric A. Hoffman","Robert C.
