Toxic coma is usually transient and disappears after elimination of xenobiotic, and possibly its active metabolites, from the body. Authors present the etiological factors, clinical features and principles of diagnosis and management of toxic coma. Additionally, mechanisms of altered consciousness induced iatrogenically by general anesthetics as well as a brief description of their toxicity are presented.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90d3cf058f61000cb33","authors":["Krzysztof Ciszowski","Aneta Mietka-Ciszowska"],"first_seen_on":"2014-01-29T11:24:23+00:00","issns":["0033-2240"],"issue":"8","journal":"Przegla\u0327d lekarski","last_mentioned_on":1390993992,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24466700?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24466700","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Toxicant-induced and drug-induced coma neurotoxicological issues of general anesthesia].","type":"article","volume":"70"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3620975,"mean":4.929685029501,"rank":2904421,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":72094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3620975,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109937,"mean":6.8842332629895,"rank":86138,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109937,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.4629122807018,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0611111111111,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AnestesiaF\/status\/428485978735386624","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2082167],"posted_on":"2014-01-29T11:13:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Anestesia-Fabumed","url":"http:\/\/www.fabumed.net\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513933046764957696\/2ZhExTfY_normal.png","description":"Anestesia.
