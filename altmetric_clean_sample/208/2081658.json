Primary symptoms of the pathology include seizures, ataxia, myoclonus, and progressive development of severe dementia. Lafora disease can be caused by defects in the EPM2A gene, which encodes the laforin protein phosphatase, or in the NHLRC1 gene (also called EPM2B) codifying the malin E3 ubiquitin ligase. Studies on cellular models showed that laforin and malin interact and operate as a functional complex apparently regulating cellular functions such as glycogen metabolism, cellular stress response, and the proteolytic processes. However, the pathogenesis and the molecular mechanism of the disease, which imply either laforin or malin are poorly understood. Thus, the aim of our study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the pathology by characterizing cerebral cortex neurodegeneration in the well accepted murine model of Lafora disease EPM2A-\/- mouse.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000872","authors":["Ortolano S","Vieitez I","Agis-Balboa RC","Spuch C","Saida Ortolano","Irene Vieitez","Roberto Carlos Agis-Balboa","Carlos Spuch"],"doi":"10.1186\/1756-6606-7-7","first_seen_on":"2014-01-29T07:50:19+00:00","issns":["1756-6606",""],"issue":"1","journal":"Molecular Brain","last_mentioned_on":1455006237,"links":["http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/7\/1\/7\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24472629","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3917365","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1756-6606-7-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.molecularbrain.com\/content\/pdf\/1756-6606-7-7.pdf","pmid":"24472629","pubdate":"2014-01-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"7","subjects":["molecularbiology","brain"],"title":"Loss of GABAergic cortical neurons underlies the neuropathology of Lafora disease","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/loss-gabaergic-cortical-neurons-underlies-neuropathology-lafora-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7156405,"mean":6.3086437613049,"rank":1444867,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":5665804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7156405,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":186371,"mean":7.1123632988144,"rank":40171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":145406,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":186371,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":408,"mean":3.8768943488943,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":324,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":408,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":2.8857142857143,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
