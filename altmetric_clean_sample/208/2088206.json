Insight in their relative importance to progression of OA may assist the development of treatment strategies for early OA. To support interpretation of experimental data, a numerical model is proposed that can predict damage progression in cartilage over time, as a consequence of excessive mechanical loading. The objective is to assess the interaction between ground substance softening and collagen fiber damage using this model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008411","authors":["Hosseini, S.M.","Wilson, W.","Ito, K.","van Donkelaar, C.C."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.joca.2013.10.010","first_seen_on":"2014-01-31T15:01:23+00:00","issns":["1063-4584"],"journal":"Osteoarthritis and Cartilage","last_mentioned_on":1391449960,"links":["http:\/\/www.oarsijournal.com\/article\/S1063-4584(13)00983-7\/abstract?rss=yes&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffere62ec&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.oarsijournal.com\/article\/S1063-4584(13)00983-7\/pdf","pmid":"24185112","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["rheumatology","orthopedics"],"title":"A numerical model to study mechanically induced initiation and progression of damage in articular cartilage","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/numerical-model-study-mechanically-induced-initiation-progression-damage-articular-cartilage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2087834,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":2382360,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123625,"mean":7.6523755419663,"rank":51856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":70338,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123625,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":663,"mean":3.655332326284,"rank":329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":663,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":7.0575,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
