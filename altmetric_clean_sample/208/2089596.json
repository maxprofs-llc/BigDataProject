Three polyomaviruses have captured attention with regard to their potential role in the development of human brain tumors: JC virus (JCV), BK virus (BKV), and simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40). JCV is a neurotropic polyomavirus that is the etiologic agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system occurring mainly in AIDS patients. BKV is the causative agent of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVN) which occurs after renal transplantation when BKV reactivates from a latent state during immunosuppressive therapy to cause allograft failure. SV40, originating in rhesus monkeys, gained notoriety when it entered the human population via contaminated polio vaccines. All three viruses are highly oncogenic when injected into the brain of experimental animals. Reports indicate that these viruses, especially JCV, are associated with brain tumors and other cancers in humans as evidenced from the analysis of clinical samples for the presence of viral DNA sequences and expression of viral proteins. Human polyomaviruses encode three non-capsid regulatory proteins: large T-antigen, small t-antigen, and agnoprotein. These proteins interact with a number of cellular target proteins to exert effects that dysregulate pathways involved in the control of various host cell functions including the cell cycle, DNA repair, and others. In this review, we describe the three polyomaviruses, their abilities to cause brain and other tumors in experimental animals, the evidence for an association with human brain tumors, and the latest findings on the molecular mechanisms of their actions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9233cf058f61000da5b","authors":["White MK","Gordon J","Reiss K","Del Valle L","Croul S","Giordano A","Darbinyan A","Khalili K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.brainresrev.2005.04.007","first_seen_on":"2014-02-01T06:30:50+00:00","issns":[""],"issue":"1","journal":"Brain research.
