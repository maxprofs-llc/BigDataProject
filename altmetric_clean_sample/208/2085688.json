According to common knowledge, it does not heal spontaneously, although some claim the opposite. Regeneration therapy by Khalifa was developed for injuries of the musculoskeletal system by using specific pressure to the skin. This randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre study was performed to validate this assumption. Thirty patients with complete ACL rupture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) verified, were included. Study examinations (e.g., international knee documentation committee (IKDC) score) were performed at inclusion (t 0). Patients were randomized to receive either standardised physiotherapy (ST) or additionally 1 hour of Khalifa therapy at the first session (STK). Twenty-four hours later, study examinations were performed again (t 1). Three months later control MRI and follow-up examinations were performed (t 2). Initial status was comparable between both groups. There was a highly significant difference of mean IKDC score results at t 1 and t 2. After 3 months, 47% of the STK patients, but no ST patient, demonstrated an end-to-end homogeneous ACL in MRI. Clinical and physical examinations were significantly different in t 1 and t 2. ACL healing can be improved with manual therapy. Physical activity can be performed without pain and nearly normal range of motion after one treatment of specific pressure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Ofner, Michael"],"doi":"10.1155\/2014\/462840","first_seen_on":"2014-01-30T16:50:02+00:00","issns":["1741-427X","1741-4288"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1465214688,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/462840\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24600477?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24600477?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24600477"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2014\/462840.pdf","pmid":"24600477","pubdate":"2014-01-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Manual khalifa therapy improves functional and morphological outcome of patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture in the knee: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"2014","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manual-khalifa-therapy-improves-functional-morphological-outcome-patients-anterior-cruciate-ligament"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.996,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.996},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7861897,"mean":6.6582651640212,"rank":644579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":7217275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7861897,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191155,"mean":7.2178654906517,"rank":18224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":172930,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191155,"percentile":90},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3878,"mean":4.5437353623936,"rank":313,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":3565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3878,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":5.4863272727273,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":96,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":86}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Student  > Ph.
