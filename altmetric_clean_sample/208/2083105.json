To date, the disease has no effective therapies. The identification of new drugs that provide benefit in arresting the decline seen in PD patients is the focus of much recent study. However, the lengthy time frame for the progression of neurodegeneration in PD increases both the time and cost of examining potential therapeutic compounds in mammalian models. An alternative is to first evaluate the efficacy of compounds in Caenorhabditis elegans models, which reduces examination time from months to days. n-Butylidenephthalide is the naturally-occurring component derived from the chloroform extract of Angelica sinensis. It has been shown to have anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties, but no reports have yet described the effects of n-butylidenephthalide on PD. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for n-butylidenephthalide to improve PD in C. elegans models.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ru-Huei Fu","Horng-Jyh Harn","Shih-Ping Liu","Chang-Shi Chen","Wen-Lin Chang","Yue-Mi Chen","Jing-En Huang","Rong-Jhu Li","Sung-Yu Tsai","Huey-Shan Hung","Woei-Cherng Shyu","Shinn-Zong Lin","Yu-Chi Wang","Anne C.
