In the present study, the amino acid enantiomers were determined by two-dimensional HPLC techniques after pre-column fluorescence derivatization with 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole. In the first dimension, the amino acid enantiomers are separated as their d plus l mixtures by the reversed-phase mode, then the d-amino acids and their l-counterparts are separately determined in the second dimension by the enantioselective columns. As a result, large amounts of d-Ala (800-4000nmol\/mL), d-Asp (200-400nmol\/mL) and d-Glu (150-500nmol\/mL) were observed in some of the traditionally produced Kurozu vinegars. Relatively large or small amounts of d-Ser (50-100nmol\/mL), d-Leu (10-50nmol\/mL) and d-allo-Ile (less than 20nmol\/mL) were also present in these samples. Developmental changes in the d-amino acid amounts during the fermentation and aging processes have also been investigated.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cf7","doi":"10.1016\/j.jchromb.2014.01.034","first_seen_on":"2014-01-31T09:04:54+00:00","issns":["15700232"],"journal":"Journal of Chromatography B: Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical & Life Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1391156712,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1570023214000464"],"pmid":"24582151","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Chiral amino acid analysis of Japanese traditional Kurozu and the developmental changes during earthenware jar fermentation processes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/chiral-amino-acid-analysis-japanese-traditional-kurozu-developmental-changes-during-earthenware-jar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6230816,"mean":5.9681228064084,"rank":2927340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1858866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6230816,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150497,"mean":7.8941361497982,"rank":74238,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":55980,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150497,"percentile":37},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":740,"mean":2.0597645466847,"rank":231,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":740,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":6.6278947368421,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
