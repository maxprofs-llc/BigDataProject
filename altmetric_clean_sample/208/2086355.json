The factors that affect progression of renal disease are unknown, especially in children and adolescents. Alterations in blood pressure, including hypertension and lack of the normal nocturnal dip in blood pressure, are important determinants of diabetic nephropathy and other renal diseases and may play a role in sickle cell nephropathy. Our primary hypothesis was that children with SCA who have microalbuminuria will demonstrate less nocturnal dipping of blood pressure compared to patients without microalbuminuria. We also investigated other potential factors associated with microalbuminuria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008482","authors":["Becker, Amy M.","Goldberg, Jordan H.","Henson, Michael","Ahn, Chul","Tong, Liyue","Baum, Michel","Buchanan, George R."],"doi":"10.1002\/pbc.24843","endpage":"522","first_seen_on":"2014-01-30T21:34:39+00:00","funders":["nhlbi"],"issns":["1545-5017","1545-5009"],"issue":"3","journal":"Pediatric Blood and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1391099740,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.24843\/abstract;jsessionid=1F53688EF6A34F8318F616D3AE596BBD.f01t04"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/pbc.24843\/pdf","pmid":"24424792","pubdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"518","subjects":["neoplasms","hematology","pediatrics"],"title":"Blood pressure abnormalities in children with sickle cell anemia","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/blood-pressure-abnormalities-children-sickle-cell-anemia-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6647401,"mean":6.157074757346,"rank":5672195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6647401,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":182471,"mean":7.087943256426,"rank":147380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":182471,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1649,"mean":2.1869417475728,"rank":1261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1649,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":1.9167532467532,"rank":56,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Computer Science":1,"Environmental Science":2}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"KE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ASPNeph\/status\/428929518166740992","license":"public","citation_ids":[2086355],"posted_on":"2014-01-30T16:35:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Am Soc Ped Neph","url":"http:\/\/www.aspneph.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/585457273931075584\/Fsll3LT0_normal.jpg","description":"Promoting optimal care for children with kidney disease through advocacy, education & research; and disseminating advances in clinical practice & investigation","id_on_source":"ASPNeph","tweeter_id":"1392927266","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2084},"tweet_id":"428929518166740992"}]}}
