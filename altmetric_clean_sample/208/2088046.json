There is evidence indicating that these mean performance measures may not sufficiently reflect the response characteristics of cognitive fatigue. We hypothesized that changes in intraindividual variability over time would be a more sensitive and ecologically meaningful metric for investigations of fatigability of cognitive performance. To test the hypothesis fifteen young adults were recruited. Trait fatigue perceptions in various domains were assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Index (MFI). Behavioral data were then recorded during performance of a three-hour continuous cued Stroop task. Results showed that intraindividual variability, as quantified by the coefficient of variation of RT, increased linearly over the course of three hours and demonstrated a significantly greater effect size than mean RT or accuracy. Change in intraindividual RT variability over time was significantly correlated with relevant subscores of the MFI including reduced activity, reduced motivation and mental fatigue. While change in mean RT over time was also correlated with reduced motivation and mental fatigue, these correlations were significantly smaller than those associated with intraindividual RT variability. RT distribution analysis using an ex-Gaussian model further revealed that change in intraindividual variability over time reflects an increase in the exponential component of variance and may reflect attentional lapses or other breakdowns in cognitive control. These results suggest that intraindividual variability and its change over time provide important metrics for measuring cognitive fatigability and may prove useful for inferring the underlying neuronal mechanisms of both perceptions of fatigue and objective changes in performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002424","doi":"10.1016\/j.bandc.2014.01.004","first_seen_on":"2014-01-31T13:28:04+00:00","issns":["02782626"],"journal":"Brain & Cognition","last_mentioned_on":1393916905,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0278262614000062"],"pmid":"24486386","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Change in intraindividual variability over time as a key metric for defining performance-based cognitive fatigability","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/change-intraindividual-variability-time-key-metric-defining-performancebased-cognitive-fatigability"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229412,"mean":5.9660401858233,"rank":2044944,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4158454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229412,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150498,"mean":7.8892666033211,"rank":44958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":104632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150498,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":593,"mean":5.8025067567568,"rank":262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":329,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":593,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.8136363636364,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
