Our primary hypothesis was that mitral valve E-point septal separation measurements would correlate with contemporaneous fractional shortening measurements of LV systolic function when performed by emergency physicians. Our secondary hypothesis was that E-point septal separation as a continuous variable would predict fractional shortening using a linear regression model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62b3cf058f610007f0e","authors":["Anthony J.
