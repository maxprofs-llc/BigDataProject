The objective of our study was to examine the inter-relationship among infection sites, systemic antibiotic use and risk of CRC among patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. From a diabetic cohort from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance claims database, we identified 3,593 incident colon cancer cases, 1,979 rectal cancer cases and 22,288 controls and conducted a nested case-control study to examine the association between antibiotic use and CRC incidence. Logistic regression models were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between infection sites, antibiotic use and CRC incidence. Patients with intra-abdominal infection were significantly associated with increased risk for colon cancer (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.73-2.35) and rectal cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.26-2.00). Any antianaerobic antibiotic use was associated with a higher risk of colon cancer (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.12-2.52) and rectal cancer (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.50-1.90) but without an obvious dose-response relationship for cumulative use. Antianaerobic antibiotics also increased the risks for those with nonintra-abdominal infection. No association was found between antiaerobic agent use and the CRC risk. The results suggest intra-abdominal infections and antianaerobic antibiotic use may be a marker for precancerous lesions or early CRC, although the possibility of antianaerobic antibiotics playing an additional role cannot be excluded. Further research examining the relationship between intra-abdominal infection, antianaerobic antibiotics use and possible change of microbiota leading to colorectal carcinogenesis is warranted.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007841","authors":["Wang JL","Chang CH","Lin JW","Wu LC","Chuang LM","Lai MS"],"doi":"10.1002\/ijc.28738","first_seen_on":"2014-01-31T18:50:52+00:00","issns":["0020-7136"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1408414602,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24470385?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"24470385","pubdate":"2014-01-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Infection, antibiotic therapy and risk of colorectal cancer-A nationwide nested case-control study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infection-antibiotic-therapy-risk-colorectal-cancer-nationwide-nested-casecontrol-study-patients-typ"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":1243401,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3197620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":138314,"mean":7.8884592482272,"rank":37825,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":97770,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":138314,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2984,"mean":4.4404753603755,"rank":615,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1735,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2984,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":5.8578387096774,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Computer Science":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IN":1},"mendeley":{"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Symbiosispapers\/status\/499499760873529344","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2088641],"posted_on":"2014-08-13T10:16:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Symbiosis papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471619200876687360\/8YeaykyW_normal.jpeg","description":"RSS feed of new symbiosis- and microbiome-related papers in PubMed.
