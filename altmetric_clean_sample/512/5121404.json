She was positive for the T14484C mutation in the mitochondrial genome, one of three common mutations causing Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In addition, MRI identified areas of demyelination within the periventricular white matter of the brain and within the spinal cord. The coexistence of multiple sclerosis and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (Harding's syndrome) is known to occur more often than would be expected by chance; therefore, screening for the Leber's mutations in multiple sclerosis patients with severe visual loss should be considered because this has important prognostic and genetic implications.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037a5","authors":["Parry-Jones, A R","Mitchell, J D","Gunarwardena, W J","Shaunak, S","A R Parry-Jones","J D Mitchell","W J Gunarwardena","S Shaunak"],"doi":"10.1136\/jnnp.2007.139360","endpage":"121","first_seen_on":"2016-02-09T16:29:25+00:00","issns":["1474-7766","1474-7758"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1407275762,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=18344382"],"pmid":"18344382","pubdate":"2008-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"118","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy associated with multiple sclerosis: Harding's syndrome.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/pn.bmj.com\/cgi\/doi\/10.1136\/jnnp.2007.139360","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lebers-hereditary-optic-neuropathy-associated-multiple-sclerosis-hardings-syndrome-specialist-regist"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4743694,"mean":5.7029253313863,"rank":644274,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":4067800,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4743694,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105218,"mean":8.3240035925754,"rank":15591,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":88433,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105218,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3305,"mean":4.80225968523,"rank":529,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2761,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3305,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":5.01232,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Neuroscience":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"NL":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"MRI Detects Early MS-Like Changes in Rare Eye Disease","url":"http:\/\/www.msdiscovery.org\/news\/new_findings\/12829-mri-detects-early-ms-changes-rare-eye-disease","license":"public","citation_ids":[5121404,2535408,2574258,2574259,2574260,1646673,2574261,131932,5242218,5309053],"posted_on":"2014-08-05T21:56:02+00:00","summary":"The association between a rare mitochondrial eye disease and MS grows curiouser and curiouser.
