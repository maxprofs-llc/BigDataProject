We have constructed and characterized, in cell culture, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, infectious cDNA clones of CHIKV using a recent isolate from La R\u00e9union Island. Comparison of the growth kinetics and infection rates of the viral isolate CHIKV strain LR2006 OPY1 (CHIKV-LR) and a full-length infectious clone (CHIKV-LR ic) indicate that the infectious clone has retained the viral phenotypes of the original isolate. Infectious clones that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) were also produced and characterized in cell culture and in Aedes mosquitoes. The CHIKV-LR 5'GFP infected Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes at a similar rate to the original virus and to the full length infectious clone. The CHIKV-LR 3'GFP only infected Ae. albopictus mosquitoes at similar rates. The development of these authentic infectious clones will enable targeted studies of the molecular determinants of infection, pathogenesis and transmission competence by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036f2","authors":["Tsetsarkin, Konstantin","Higgs, Stephen","McGee, Charles E","De Lamballerie, Xavier","Charrel, Remi N","Vanlandingham, Dana L"],"doi":"10.1089\/vbz.2006.6.325","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T05:13:08+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1530-3667"],"issue":"4","journal":"Vector Borne & Zoonotic Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1369246064,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17187566"],"pmid":"17187566","pubdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["epidemiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Infectious clones of Chikungunya virus (La R\u00e9union isolate) for vector competence studies.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/infectious-clones-chikungunya-virus-la-r%C3%A9union-isolate-vector-competence-studies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3858310,"mean":5.0335338185764,"rank":737408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3095126,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3858310,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52385,"mean":4.7322620647526,"rank":10116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":41927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52385,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":425,"mean":2.3073962264151,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":425,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":0.76190476190476,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":21,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
