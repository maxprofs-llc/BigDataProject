The current study (n=129; median age, 52 years; 69 males) reveals, on multivariable analysis, that an absolute monocyte count of > or =1 x 10(9)L(-1) carries an independent predictive value (p=0.02), for an inferior survival, in addition to that provided by hemoglobin level (p=0.002), platelet count (0.02), and leukocyte count (p=0.16). The inclusion of the monocyte count as a fourth risk factor enabled the construction of a new and improved Mayo PSS; median survival was 173, 61, and 26 months in the absence of all four (low-risk), three (intermediate-risk), or two or less (high-risk) adverse features, respectively (p<0.0001). The independent prognostic value of monocytosis was validated in a separate database of 97 patients with PMF from another institution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["M.A. Elliott","S.
