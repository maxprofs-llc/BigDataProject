Their dysregulation has been implicated in a number of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the serum of patients with psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and conversion disorder (CD). In human patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, there is an increase in both BDNF mRNA and protein levels in surgically resected hippocampi compared to controls. One study of children with epilepsy has found normal to increased serum BDNF levels compared to controls. Plasma [corrected] BDNF levels have not been investigated in adult patients with epileptic seizures (ES). We hypothesized that BDNF would differentiate between ES and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["W.C.
