For some individuals, however, core beliefs may also explicitly involve spiritual themes. In this article, we propose a cognitive model of worry, in which positive\/negative beliefs about the Divine affect symptoms through the mechanism of intolerance of uncertainty. Using mediation analyses, we found support for our model across two studies, in particular, with regards to negative spiritual beliefs. These findings highlight the importance of assessing for spiritual alongside secular convictions when creating cognitive-behavioral case formulations in the treatment of religious individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d07","authors":["Rosmarin, David H.","Pirutinsky, Steven","Auerbach, Randy P.","Bj\u00f6rgvinsson, Thr\u00f6stur","Bigda\u2010Peyton, Joseph","Andersson, Gerhard","Pargament, Kenneth I.","Krumrei, Elizabeth J."],"doi":"10.1002\/jclp.20798","endpage":"700","first_seen_on":"2011-08-18T16:35:38+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1097-4679","0021-9762"],"issue":"7","journal":"Journal of Clinical Psychology","last_mentioned_on":1319551200,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jclp.20798\/full","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/jclp.20798","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jclp.20798\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/jclp.20798\/pdf","pmid":"21480226","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"691","subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Incorporating spiritual beliefs into a cognitive model of worry","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incorporating-spiritual-beliefs-cognitive-model-worry"},"altmetric_score":{"score":21.456,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":21.456},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6701265,"mean":6.1631257476184,"rank":293558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":6408172,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6701265,"percentile":95},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69685,"mean":5.5189241145744,"rank":3224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":66461,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69685,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":815,"mean":4.8095724815725,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":784,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":815,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.9318181818182,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":10,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
