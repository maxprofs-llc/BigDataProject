We developed a capture method that uses biotinylated RNA 'baits' to fish targets out of a 'pond' of DNA fragments. The RNA is transcribed from PCR-amplified oligodeoxynucleotides originally synthesized on a microarray, generating sufficient bait for multiple captures at concentrations high enough to drive the hybridization. We tested this method with 170-mer baits that target >15,000 coding exons (2.5 Mb) and four regions (1.7 Mb total) using Illumina sequencing as read-out. About 90% of uniquely aligning bases fell on or near bait sequence; up to 50% lay on exons proper. The uniformity was such that approximately 60% of target bases in the exonic 'catch', and approximately 80% in the regional catch, had at least half the mean coverage. One lane of Illumina sequence was sufficient to call high-confidence genotypes for 89% of the targeted exon space.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003162","authors":["Andreas Gnirke","Alexandre Melnikov","Jared Maguire","Peter Rogov","Emily M LeProust","William Brockman","Timothy Fennell","Georgia Giannoukos","Sheila Fisher","Carsten Russ","Stacey Gabriel","David B Jaffe","Eric S Lander","Chad Nusbaum"],"doi":"10.1038\/nbt.1523","endpage":"189","first_seen_on":"2011-08-17T15:26:13+00:00","issns":["1087-0156","1546-1696"],"journal":"Nature Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1478636514,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/nbt.1523.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nbt\/journal\/v27\/n2\/full\/nbt.1523.html"],"pmid":"19182786","pubdate":"2009-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"182","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Solution hybrid selection with ultra-long oligonucleotides for massively parallel targeted sequencing","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/solution-hybrid-selection-ultralong-oligonucleotides-massively-parallel-targeted-sequencing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.748,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.748},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7662843,"mean":6.5825569912527,"rank":446522,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7216332,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7662843,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73502,"mean":5.7067112828397,"rank":4552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":68949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73502,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3857,"mean":23.296512448133,"rank":965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":2892,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3857,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":12.093282051282,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":56,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":9,"Professor > Associate Professor":53,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":331,"Student  > Doctoral Student":45,"Student  > Ph.
