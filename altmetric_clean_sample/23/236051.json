Internalising problems affect 1 in 7 school aged children, impacting on peer relations, school engagement, and later mental health, relationships and employment. The development of early childhood prevention for internalising problems is in its infancy. The current study follows two successful 'efficacy' trials of a parenting group intervention to reduce internalising disorders in temperamentally inhibited preschool children. Cool Little Kids is a population-level randomised trial to determine the impacts of systematically screening preschoolers for inhibition then offering a parenting group intervention, on child internalising problems and economic costs at school entry.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Bayer JK","Rapee RM","Hiscock H","Ukoumunne OC","Mihalopoulos C","Clifford S","Wake M","Jordana K Bayer","Ronald M Rapee","Harriet Hiscock","Obioha C Ukoumunne","Cathrine Mihalopoulos","Susan Clifford","Melissa Wake"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-11-11","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T07:36:00+00:00","handle":"11343\/29076","handles":["11343\/29076"],"issns":["1471-2458",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1310342400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21208451","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2458-11-11"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2458-11-11?site=bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com","pmcid":"PMC3027133","pmid":"21208451","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"11","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"The Cool Little Kids randomised controlled trial: population-level early prevention for anxiety disorders.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-11-11","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cool-little-kids-randomised-controlled-trial-populationlevel-early-prevention-anxiety-disorders"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632750,"mean":4.9231796234803,"rank":2015194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":945884,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632750,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51743,"mean":4.6708228131885,"rank":21979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":22228,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51743,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4382,"mean":5.4443524309518,"rank":3109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4382,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209,"mean":4.0572596153846,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":48,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Researcher":22,"Student  > Ph.
