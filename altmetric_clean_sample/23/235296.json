IPV was associated with greater involvement by men in pregnancies ending in abortion and greater conflict regarding decisions to seek abortion. IPV should be considered within family planning and abortion services; policies requiring women to notify or obtain consent of partners before seeking an abortion should be reconsidered; they may facilitate endangerment and coercion regarding such decisions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000221a","authors":["Jay G.
