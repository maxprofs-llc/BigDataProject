A questionnaire was sent to 120 consultant pediatricians. Among the 88 respondents, 18% would carry out a repeat chest radiograph on follow-up of all their patients admitted with pneumonia, whereas 78% would perform the investigation selectively. Among the criteria for selection, persistence of symptoms and collapse or effusion were cited, although a considerable number would repeat a chest radiograph in children with lobar pneumonia. The mean timing of a repeat chest radiograph was 5.5 weeks after presentation (range 2-12 weeks). Only 23% of the respondents worked in units with written guidelines for the follow-up of children with pneumonia. Written guidelines, specifying the categories of children who would benefit from follow-up chest radiographs, should be present and implemented in all pediatric departments.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002570","authors":["Mahmood, Dhia","Vartzelis, George","McQueen, Paula","Perkin, Michael R"],"doi":"10.1177\/0009922806290055","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T05:27:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0009-9228"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Pediatrics","last_mentioned_on":1176681600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17325090"],"pmid":"17325090","pubdate":"2007-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Radiological follow-up of pediatric pneumonia: principle and practice.","type":"article","volume":"46","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/radiological-followup-pediatric-pneumonia-principle-practice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626012,"mean":4.9497445252532,"rank":2018531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930185,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626012,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51703,"mean":4.7355313914355,"rank":22226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":21493,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51703,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":467,"mean":4.7367167381974,"rank":252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":467,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.0376,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1078749","license":"public","citation_ids":[231553],"posted_on":"2007-04-16T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["new_finding"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
