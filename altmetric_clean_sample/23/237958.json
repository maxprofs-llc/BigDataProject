This study examined the effect of Red Bull\u2122 on repeated sprint performance in women athletes. Fifteen collegiate soccer players participated, with mean age, height, and body mass equal to 19.5\u00b11.1 year, 168.4\u00b15.8 cm, and 63.4\u00b16.1 kg, respectively. After performing a familiarization trial, subjects performed three sets of eight bouts of the modified t test after ingestion of 255 mL of placebo or Red Bull 1 h pre-exercise in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design. Throughout testing, sprint time, heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were continuously obtained. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine differences in variables between drink conditions. Across athletes, t test time ranged from 10.4 to 12.7 s. Mean sprint time was similar (p>0.05) between Red Bull (11.31\u00b10.61 s) and placebo (11.35\u00b10.61 s). HR and RPE increased (p<0.05) during the bouts, but there was no effect (p>0.05) of Red Bull on either variable versus placebo. Findings indicate that 255 mL of Red Bull containing 1.3 mg\/kg of caffeine and 1 g of taurine does not alter repeated sprint performance, RPE, or HR in women athletes versus placebo. One serving of this energy drink provides no ergogenic benefit for women athletes engaging in sprint-based exercise.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000223e","doi":"10.1007\/s00726-011-0900-8","first_seen_on":"2011-08-17T06:50:15+00:00","issns":["1438-2199"],"journal":"Amino Acids","last_mentioned_on":1445445001,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21461905","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00726-011-0900-8","http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00726-011-0900-8?utm_content=buffer740b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmid":"21461905","pubdate":"2011-04-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Effects of red bull energy drink on repeated sprint performance in women athletes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-red-bull-energy-drink-repeated-sprint-performance-women-athletes-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":15.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":15.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6356958,"mean":5.9827593932131,"rank":372490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":5983825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6356958,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64910,"mean":5.6118105963734,"rank":4435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":60465,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64910,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":584,"mean":5.2491012006861,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":539,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":584,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":3.342,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":90}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":12,"researcher":3,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":13,"Scientists":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
