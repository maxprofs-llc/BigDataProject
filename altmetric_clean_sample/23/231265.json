This device could potentially be used to assess primary hemostasis prior to regional anesthesia. In this prospective, observational study we sought to establish 95% reference intervals for PFA-100 and Thromboelastograph (TEG) values for our normal pregnant population, before comparing the PFA and TEG in measuring platelet function in preeclamptic and healthy pregnant women at term, using confidence interval analysis and analysis of variance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000571e","doi":"10.1213\/01.ane.0000253510.00213.05","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T05:19:16+00:00","issns":["1526-7598"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anesthesia and analgesia","last_mentioned_on":1172793600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17242101"],"pmid":"17242101","pubdate":"2007-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Hemostatic function in healthy pregnant and preeclamptic women: an assessment using the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) and thromboelastograph.","type":"article","volume":"104","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hemostatic-function-healthy-pregnant-preeclamptic-women-assessment-using-platelet-function-analyzer-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627074,"mean":4.9506160212417,"rank":2018593,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":931625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627074,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51713,"mean":4.7301314201733,"rank":22215,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":21548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51713,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2352,"mean":2.7086831135687,"rank":1070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2352,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":0.96976744186047,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
