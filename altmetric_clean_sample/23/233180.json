This hypothesis was based on evidence that acute inflammatory processes induce cytokine expression in the brain and affect neuronal activity. We also studied whether depletion of hypothalamic noradrenaline can affect peripheral joint disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000231f","authors":["del Rey, Adriana","Wolff, Christine","Wildmann, Johannes","Randolf, Anke","Hahnel, Anja","Besedovsky, Hugo O","Straub, Rainer H"],"doi":"10.1002\/art.23869","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T06:12:09+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0004-3591"],"issue":"10","journal":"Arthritis & Rheumatism","last_mentioned_on":1235952000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18821705"],"pmid":"18821705","pubdate":"2008-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"Disrupted brain-immune system-joint communication during experimental arthritis.","type":"article","volume":"58","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/disrupted-brainimmune-systemjoint-communication-during-experimental-arthritis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628651,"mean":4.9397870194191,"rank":2016853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628651,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51724,"mean":4.7050045821008,"rank":22122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51724,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1666,"mean":3.5934570570571,"rank":882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1666,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":1.2244444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
