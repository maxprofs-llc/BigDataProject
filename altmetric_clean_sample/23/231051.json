Of 121 patients with chronic urticaria, 50 (41%) tested positive to contact allergens. In all patients, avoidance measures led to a complete remission within 1 month. We suggest that testing for contact sensitization can be helpful in the management of chronic urticaria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e8d","doi":"10.1016\/j.jaad.2006.07.023","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T05:13:23+00:00","issns":["1097-6787"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1174435200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17190624"],"pmid":"17190624","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dermatology"],"title":"Role of contact sensitization in chronic urticaria.","type":"article","volume":"56","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-contact-sensitization-chronic-urticaria"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631865,"mean":4.925550910502,"rank":2015246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":944401,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631865,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51736,"mean":4.6762722334976,"rank":22007,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":22154,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51736,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1828,"mean":2.6969293924466,"rank":968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":421,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1828,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":33,"mean":2.37575,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":33,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":2,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/1060792","license":"public","citation_ids":[231051],"posted_on":"2007-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["controversial"],"f1000_score":"1"}]}}
