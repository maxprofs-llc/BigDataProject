Diagnosis is difficult without selenium homocholic acid taurine (SeHCAT) testing. The diarrhea results from excess colonic bile acids, but the pathogenesis is unclear. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), produced in the ileum in response to bile acid absorption, regulates hepatic bile acid synthesis. We proposed that FGF19 is involved in bile acid diarrhea and measured its levels in patients with BAM.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006eff","doi":"10.1016\/j.cgh.2009.04.024","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T06:31:26+00:00","issns":["1542-7714"],"issue":"11","journal":"Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology","last_mentioned_on":1389313295,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19426836"],"pmid":"19426836","pubdate":"2009-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"A new mechanism for bile acid diarrhea: defective feedback inhibition of bile acid biosynthesis.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-mechanism-bile-acid-diarrhea-defective-feedback-inhibition-bile-acid-biosynthesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3930654,"mean":5.018001926844,"rank":748434,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":3152709,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3930654,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52665,"mean":4.7251782024008,"rank":10152,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":42168,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52665,"percentile":80},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1022,"mean":6.5180156709109,"rank":268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":744,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1022,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.7533333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
