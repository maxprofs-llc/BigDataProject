The field emission process follows the standard Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling of cold electron emission. The emission mechanism is found to be a combination of low electron affinity, internal nanostructure and large field enhancement at the low-dimensional emitter tips of the nanoparticles. The field emission properties are comparable to the conventional carbon-based field emitters, and thus can become alternative candidate for field emission devices for low-power panel applications.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Nanot..22J5705N","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5093cf058f610003146","doi":"10.1088\/0957-4484\/22\/36\/365705","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T10:21:47+00:00","issns":["1361-6528"],"issue":"36","journal":"Nanotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1313488864,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21841217?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21841217","pubdate":"2011-08-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"IOP PUBLISHING LTD","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Low-macroscopic field emission properties of wide bandgap copper aluminium oxide nanoparticles for low-power panel applications.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lowmacroscopic-field-emission-properties-wide-bandgap-copper-aluminium-oxide-nanoparticles-lowpower"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4504824,"mean":5.0923717479595,"rank":3182846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":1033451,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4504824,"percentile":22},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54432,"mean":4.9557240175635,"rank":32941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":17080,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54432,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":995,"mean":5.2573561368209,"rank":644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":275,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":995,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":2.6002368421053,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
