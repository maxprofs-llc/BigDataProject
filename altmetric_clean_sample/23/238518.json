In recent years,researches have increasingly showed that epigenetic modifications usually occur at the early stage of diseases, and make greater contributions to the occurrence and development of diseases compared to genetic abnormalities. Thus, researches on epigenetic effects of air pollution would serve for better understanding the interaction between air pollutants and genome in the pathogenesis of disease. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the exposure to air pollution and diminish the adverse effects related, further studies are needed to identify epigenetic biomarkers of air pollution so that we can take timely and effective measures in disease prevention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd25","first_seen_on":"2011-08-17T15:40:43+00:00","issns":["1008-9292"],"issue":"4","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao Yi xue ban Journal of Zhejiang University Medical sciences","last_mentioned_on":1313592384,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21845763?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"21845763","pubdate":"2011-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Current progress in research on epigenetic effects of air pollution].","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/current-progress-research-epigenetic-effects-air-pollution"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5041086,"mean":5.964734720803,"rank":3563398,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":828577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5041086,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62577,"mean":5.2838638775249,"rank":42788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":8688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62577,"percentile":13},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":0.93577464788732,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/EpiExperts\/status\/103840104946212864","citation_ids":[238518],"posted_on":"2011-08-17T14:46:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Epigenetics Experts","url":"https:\/\/www.neb.com\/applications\/epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1272756784\/E3logo_twt2_normal.jpg","description":"New England Biolabs brings you EpiExperts, engaging epigenetics experts.
