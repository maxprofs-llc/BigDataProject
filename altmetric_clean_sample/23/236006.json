We have used confocal microscopy and Ca(2+) sensitive dyes to directly measure the action potential-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) in the boutons of Schaffer collaterals. This reveals that the trial-by-trial amplitude of the evoked Ca(2+) transient is bimodally distributed. We demonstrate that \"large\" Ca(2+) transients occur when presynaptic NMDA receptors are activated following transmitter release. Presynaptic NMDA receptor activation proves critical in producing facilitation of transmission at theta frequencies. Because large Ca(2+) transients \"report\" transmitter release, their frequency on a trial-by-trial basis can be used to estimate the probability of release, p(r). We use this novel estimator to show that p(r) increases following the induction of long-term potentiation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f61000319c","doi":"10.1016\/j.neuron.2010.11.023","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T07:34:49+00:00","issns":["1097-4199"],"issue":"6","journal":"Neuron","last_mentioned_on":1299456000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21172613"],"pmid":"21172613","pubdate":"2010-12-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Presynaptic NMDARs in the hippocampus facilitate transmitter release at theta frequency.","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/presynaptic-nmdars-hippocampus-facilitate-transmitter-release-theta-frequency"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627924,"mean":4.9449041432285,"rank":2017817,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":934204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627924,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51718,"mean":4.7185808534911,"rank":22176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":21685,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51718,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3775,"mean":10.094987281399,"rank":2369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":638,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3775,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":5.4846557377049,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":9}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":12,"Researcher":65,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
