Gender differences in CHD incidence and mortality are often explained in relation to biological (hormonal) and behavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking), but psychological factors and broader social constructions of gender are rarely considered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b49","authors":["Hunt K","Lewars H","Emslie C","Batty GD","K.
