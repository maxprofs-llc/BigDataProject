However, we found an absence of prospective studies comparing high-frequency percussive ventilation with contemporary low-tidal volume ventilation strategies. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the two ventilator modalities in a burn intensive care unit setting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000263f","doi":"10.1097\/ccm.0b013e3181eb9d0b","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T07:17:14+00:00","issns":["1530-0293"],"issue":"10","journal":"Critical Care Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1295481600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20639746"],"pmid":"20639746","pubdate":"2010-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["criticalcare"],"title":"High-frequency percussive ventilation and low tidal volume ventilation in burns: a randomized controlled trial.","type":"article","volume":"38","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/highfrequency-percussive-ventilation-low-tidal-volume-ventilation-burns-randomized-controlled-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628563,"mean":4.9406420973419,"rank":2017141,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":936395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628563,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51724,"mean":4.7071897221739,"rank":22131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":21792,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51724,"percentile":42},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2870,"mean":5.2558313001046,"rank":2008,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":291,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2870,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":2.95,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":7,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Ph.
