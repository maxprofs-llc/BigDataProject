This occurs by the combined action of the gastric intrinsic factor (IF) and the ileal endocytic cubam receptor formed by the 460-kilodalton (kDa) protein cubilin and the 45-kDa transmembrane protein amnionless. Loss of function of any of these proteins ultimately leads to Cbl deficiency in man. Here we present the crystal structure of the complex between IF-Cbl and the cubilin IF-Cbl-binding-region (CUB(5-8)) determined at 3.3 A resolution. The structure provides insight into how several CUB (for 'complement C1r\/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1') domains collectively function as modular ligand-binding regions, and how two distant CUB domains embrace the Cbl molecule by binding the two IF domains in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This dual-point model provides a probable explanation of how Cbl indirectly induces ligand-receptor coupling. Finally, the comparison of Ca(2+)-binding CUB domains and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-type A modules suggests that the electrostatic pairing of a basic ligand arginine\/lysine residue with Ca(2+)-coordinating acidic aspartates\/glutamates is a common theme of Ca(2+)-dependent ligand-receptor interactions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2010Natur.464..445A","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","doi":"10.1038\/nature08874","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T07:04:37+00:00","issns":["1476-4687"],"issue":"7287","journal":"Nature","last_mentioned_on":1277337600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20237569"],"pmid":"20237569","pubdate":"2010-03-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","scopus_subjects":["General"],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Structural basis for receptor recognition of vitamin-B(12)-intrinsic factor complexes.","type":"article","volume":"464","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-basis-receptor-recognition-vitaminb12intrinsic-factor-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4864355,"mean":5.7917704295413,"rank":2581012,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1624842,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4864355,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55573,"mean":5.4815647448355,"rank":26525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":19141,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55573,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38740,"mean":58.237983117788,"rank":34306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":1590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38740,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":860,"mean":46.755944121071,"rank":785,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":860,"percentile":3}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":17,"Student  > Ph.
