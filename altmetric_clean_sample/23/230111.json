The assessment and optimization of purification schemes for specific cellular subtypes such as CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells is a critical consideration in developing cell-based therapies in the clinical setting. In the following studies, different strategies for magnetic isolation are compared and the parameters which affect the overall potency of purified human CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells are discussed. The data demonstrate that large-scale magnetic isolation can be used to efficiently and reproducibly purify human CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells capable of modulating alloreactive T cell responses. The ability to rapidly purify the desired cells from peripheral blood suggests that magnetic isolation may be a suitable alternative to cell sorting for clinical settings, where large numbers of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells may be necessary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002df0","doi":"10.1016\/j.jim.2006.06.014","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T04:47:54+00:00","issns":["0022-1759"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","last_mentioned_on":1163980800,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16887141"],"pmid":"16887141","pubdate":"2006-08-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Efficient and reproducible large-scale isolation of human CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells with potent suppressor activity.","type":"article","volume":"315","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficient-reproducible-largescale-isolation-human-cd4-cd25-regulatory-t-cells-potent-suppressor-acti-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627694,"mean":4.9472740289804,"rank":2018122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":933298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627694,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51716,"mean":4.7235288020884,"rank":22190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":21628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51716,"percentile":41},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":338,"mean":1.9634065281899,"rank":171,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":100,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":338,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.5,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
