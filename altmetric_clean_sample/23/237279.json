A mutation in Patched, Smoothened or Gli1, which regulate the Hh signaling pathway, might lead to the onset of glioblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Recently, Hh signaling has been reported to be activated in a ligand-dependent manner, contributing to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Hedgehog signaling is reactivated in various types of cancer, and this contributes to cancer progression by facilitating proliferation, invasion and cell survival. Moreover, Hh signaling is associated with several other signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression. These observations indicate that controlling Hh signaling might become a target for novel molecular targeting therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dd7","authors":["Onishi, Hideya","Katano, Mitsuo"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2011.02010.x","endpage":"1760","first_seen_on":"2011-08-16T16:46:17+00:00","issns":["1349-7006"],"issue":"10","journal":"Cancer Science","last_mentioned_on":1313505328,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2011.02010.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1349-7006.2011.02010.x\/pdf","pmid":"21679342","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1756","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Hedgehog signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in various types of cancer","type":"article","volume":"102","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hedgehog-signaling-pathway-therapeutic-target-various-types-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3063579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":943260,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54437,"mean":5.2789262987728,"rank":35992,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":8984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54437,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":641,"mean":2.1471625,"rank":384,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":162,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":641,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":0.65,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
