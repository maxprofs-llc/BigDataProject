Although trust in doctors and health empowerment are widely studied, no previous research has examined their measurement invariance. The Short Wake Forest Physician Trust scale and the Health Empowerment scale were administered online. Participants were 217 German-speaking women ( M\u2009=\u200939.07, standard deviation\u2009=\u20095.71) and 217 French-speaking women ( M\u2009=\u200939.11, standard deviation\u2009=\u20095.82). Demonstration of partial scalar invariance was met and reasons for non-invariant items are discussed. The study was evaluated applying COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments checklist.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dd2","authors":["Serena Petrocchi","Nanon H.M.
