Severity ranges from asymptomatic to acute decompensated heart failure. Our patient suffered a stab wound to the chest and was initially taken to the operating room for repair of a lacerated right ventricle. Subsequent postoperative hemodynamic deterioration prompted a bedside transthoracic echocardiogram, which failed to identify causal factors. A transesophageal echocardiogram performed immediately after ventral septal defect was demonstrated. This case serves to highlight the gaps in current standard practice and encourages the use of transesophageal echocardiogram as a screening tool in patients after penetrating cardiac injuries.","altmetric_jid":"5523eeb62a83ee005f8b4577","authors":["Faloye, Abimbola O.","Gershon, Raphael Y."],"doi":"10.1213\/xaa.0000000000000528","first_seen_on":"2017-08-14T18:49:46+00:00","issns":["2325-7237"],"issue":"3","journal":"A&A Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1504416256,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aacr\/Abstract\/2017\/08010\/Traumatic_Ventricular_Septal_Defect_After_Stab.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/aacr\/2017\/08010\/Traumatic_Ventricular_Septal_Defect_After_Stab.1.pdf","pmid":"28445175","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","startpage":"65","title":"Traumatic Ventricular Septal Defect After Stab Wound to the Chest Missed by Transthoracic Echocardiography","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/aacr\/Fulltext\/2017\/08010\/Traumatic_Ventricular_Septal_Defect_After_Stab.1.aspx","volume":"9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":2.35,"1m":2.35,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355417,"mean":7.0462862311029,"rank":3477977,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4832017,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355417,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171727,"mean":12.323003866625,"rank":62497,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":107670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171727,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":1.3790662650602,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.3571428571429,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"EG":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IARS_Journals\/statuses\/897168327512031232","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23807355],"posted_on":"2017-08-14T18:49:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Anesthesia&Analgesia","url":"http:\/\/Anesthesia-Analgesia.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/770006900603781120\/OO99SIcu_normal.jpg","description":"ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA is the official journal of the IARS.
