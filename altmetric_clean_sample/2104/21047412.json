Both inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity have crucial implications for clinical practices. Here, we review computational methods that use somatic alterations measured through next-generation DNA sequencing technologies for characterizing tumor heterogeneity and its association with clinical variables. We first review computational methods for studying inter-tumor heterogeneity, focusing on methods that attempt to summarize cancer heterogeneity by discovering pathways that are commonly mutated across different patients of the same cancer type. We then review computational methods for characterizing intra-tumor heterogeneity using information from bulk sequencing data or from single cell sequencing data. Finally, we present some of the recent computational methodologies that have been proposed to identify and assess the association between inter- or intra-tumor heterogeneity with clinical variables.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0d","authors":["Vandin, Fabio","Fabio Vandin"],"doi":"10.3389\/fgene.2017.00083","first_seen_on":"2017-06-14T05:05:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1664-8021"],"journal":"Frontiers in Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1501122998,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fgene.2017.00083\/full","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fgene.2017.00083\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FGENE_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28659971?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/fgene.2017.00083"],"pmcid":"PMC5469877","pmid":"28659971","pubdate":"2017-06-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Computational Methods for Characterizing Cancer Mutational Heterogeneity","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/computational-methods-characterizing-cancer-mutational-heterogeneity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.35,"score_history":{"1y":3.35,"6m":2.35,"3m":2.35,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":2010955,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6251210,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237452,"mean":11.960755903323,"rank":73578,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":162793,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237452,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1728,"mean":5.1040938042849,"rank":510,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":1208,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1728,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":9.3910952380952,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
