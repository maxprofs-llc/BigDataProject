We tested intelligibility when shadowing was used as a response measure (Experiment 1), when recall was used as a response measure (Experiment 2), and when time-compression was used to vary the speech rate of the presented materials (Experiment 3). In spite of claims that older adults are generally slower in switching attention, younger and older adults did not differ in the critical alternation rates producing minimal intelligibility. We suggest that the point of minimal intelligibility in alternated speech reflects an interaction between (1) the rate of disruption induced by breaking the speech stream between two sound sources, (2) the amount of contextual information per ear, and (3) the size of the silent gaps separating the speech elements that must be perceptually bridged.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032bf","authors":["Raj Stewart","Ethan Yetton","Arthur Wingfield"],"doi":"10.3758\/pp.70.2.337","first_seen_on":"2017-06-14T01:17:57+00:00","issns":["0031-5117","1532-5962"],"issue":"2","journal":"Perception & Psychophysics","last_mentioned_on":1497406926,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2637455\/"],"pmcid":"PMC2637455","pmid":"18372754","pubdate":"2008-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"NIH Public Access","startpage":"337","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychology"],"title":"Perception of alternated speech operates similarly in young and older adults with age-normal hearing","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/perception-alternated-speech-operates-similarly-young-older-adults-agenormal-hearing"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8366012,"mean":7.0543497525808,"rank":6348598,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1134049,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8366012,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241976,"mean":12.633998355202,"rank":171413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":44335,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241976,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":3.9121342281879,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
