Material collected in Java at the beginning of the 19(th) century by Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour and used to describe these taxa has not been found, despite extensive searches in European herbaria. We here stabilise use of these names by comparing herbarium specimens and drawings of original material made by the artist Toussaint Fran\u00e7ois Node-V\u00e9ran. Detailed descriptions with synonymy, preliminary conservation assessments and specimen citations are provided for both species. Lectotypes are designated for all names (including synonyms) and epitypes designated for Solanum poka and Solanum graciliflorum to stabilise usage.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc72","authors":["Xavier Aubriot"," Caroline Loup"," Sandra Knapp"],"doi":"10.3897\/phytokeys.70.9758","endpage":"110","first_seen_on":"2016-10-11T10:42:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1314-2003","1314-2011"],"issue":"70","journal":"PhytoKeys","last_mentioned_on":1489753253,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/phytokeys.70.9758","http:\/\/phytokeys.pensoft.net\/articles.php?id=9758"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/phytokeys.pensoft.net\/lib\/ajax_srv\/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_pdf&item_id=9758","pmcid":"PMC5088705","pmid":"27829800","pubdate":"2016-04-10T23:25:14+00:00","publisher":"Pensoft Publishers","startpage":"97","title":"Confirming the identity of two enigmatic \u201cspiny solanums\u201d (Solanum subgenus Leptostemonum, Solanaceae) collected by Jean-Baptiste Leschenault in Java","type":"article","volume":"70","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/confirming-identity-two-enigmatic-spiny-solanums-solanum-subgenus-leptostemonum-solanaceae-collected"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.95,"score_history":{"1y":3.95,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":1906021,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":6456924,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":77},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251399,"mean":12.690557116604,"rank":76078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":174804,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251399,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":364,"mean":14.535393939394,"rank":180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":364,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":7.90575,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Professor":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BG":1,"ES":2,"GB":1},"mendeley":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PhytoKeys\/statuses\/783953374525919232","license":"public","citation_ids":[12560300],"posted_on":"2016-10-06T08:53:44+00:00","author":{"name":"PhytoKeys","url":"http:\/\/phytokeys.pensoft.net","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1157939210\/PhytoKeysLogo_normal.jpg","description":"The next generation journal in systematic botany","id_on_source":"PhytoKeys","tweeter_id":"206816200","geo":{"lt":42.69751,"ln":23.32415,"country":"BG"},"followers":777},"tweet_id":"783953374525919232"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fossilplants\/statuses\/783956672779804673","license":"public","citation_ids":[12560300],"posted_on":"2016-10-06T09:06:50+00:00","author":{"name":"RobbieBlackhallMiles","url":"http:\/\/www.fossilplants.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/903585772619616258\/ZaVppCby_normal.jpg","description":"Plantsman, conservationist, blogger, author, FLS, botanical explorer, chair of @GondwanaPlants, grow #Proteaceae & restoring @Eincaerddol","id_on_source":"fossilplants","tweeter_id":"458283329","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":6461},"tweet_id":"783956672779804673"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CarmenAcedo\/statuses\/784023263399862273","license":"public","rt":["PhytoKeys"],"citation_ids":[12560300],"posted_on":"2016-10-06T13:31:27+00:00","author":{"name":"Carmen Acedo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/899329592204382209\/ETVBtnu__normal.jpg","description":"Botany professor @unileon studying #plant #taxonomy and #evolution, focused in #grasses; #iamabotanist friend of grasses;-) interesting in plant conservation","id_on_source":"CarmenAcedo","tweeter_id":"351261732","geo":{"lt":41.66667,"ln":-4.25,"country":"ES"},"followers":249},"tweet_id":"784023263399862273"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NHM_Science\/statuses\/842712120768774145","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12560300],"posted_on":"2017-03-17T12:20:01+00:00","author":{"name":"NHM Science","url":"http:\/\/www.nhm.ac.uk\/our-science.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3677114697\/12447f8b80711abec4b848bb3a6eca89_normal.jpeg","description":"Science from the Natural History Museum.
