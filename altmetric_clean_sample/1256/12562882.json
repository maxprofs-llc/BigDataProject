Secondary analyses were conducted on data from Waves 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study, which permitted the examination of neighborhood influences among a socioeconomically diverse sample of African American parents and adolescents (n\u00a0=\u00a0863; Mage \u00a0=\u00a012.29). Youth exposed to more neighborhood disadvantage in seventh grade reported more negative concurrent neighborhood perceptions, which, in turn, predicted greater expectations of racial discrimination in eighth grade; youth's expectations remained stable into adulthood. Thus, support was found for the mediating role of youth's subjective neighborhood perceptions in the longitudinal relation between neighborhood structure and expectations of racial discrimination.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000013c","authors":["Witherspoon, Dawn P.","Seaton, Eleanor K.","Rivas\u2010Drake, Deborah"],"doi":"10.1111\/cdev.12595","endpage":"1378","first_seen_on":"2016-10-11T13:26:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1467-8624"],"issue":"5","journal":"Child Development","last_mentioned_on":1476192355,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12595\/abstract?campaign=woletoc&elq_mid=12530&elq_cid=5857191"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cdev.12595\/pdf","pmid":"27684392","pubdate":"2016-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"1367","subjects":["pediatrics"],"title":"Neighborhood Characteristics and Expectations of Racially Discriminatory Experiences Among African American Adolescents","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/neighborhood-characteristics-expectations-racially-discriminatory-experiences-among-african-american"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":3437741,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3916598,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239022,"mean":12.448345082649,"rank":111265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":120852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239022,"percentile":50},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2399,"mean":11.537792326939,"rank":1960,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":400,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2399,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":16.112735294118,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":36}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
