This approach does not allow associating specific genes with transport reactions, which impairs the ability of the model to predict effects of gene deletions. Novel methods for systematic genome-wide transporter functional annotation and their integration into GSMMs are therefore necessary. In this work, an automatic system to detect and classify all potential membrane transport proteins for a given genome and integrate the related reactions into GSMMs is proposed, based on the identification and classification of genes that encode transmembrane proteins. The Transport Reactions Annotation and Generation (TRIAGE) tool identifies the metabolites transported by each transmembrane protein and its transporter family. The localization of the carriers is also predicted and, consequently, their action is confined to a given membrane. The integration of the data provided by TRIAGE with highly curated models allowed the identification of new transport reactions. TRIAGE is included in the new release of merlin, a software tool previously developed by the authors, which expedites the GSMM reconstruction processes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4c93cf058f61000002e","authors":["O.
