HfC was observed as the main competing phase. The lattice parameters of Hf2AlC and Hf3AlC2 were determined by Rietveld refinement based on the X-ray diffraction data. The atomic stacking sequence was revealed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mixtures of 211 and 312 stacking were observed within the same grain, including 523 layers. This transition in atomic structure is discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Thomas Lapauw"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01398","first_seen_on":"2016-10-11T18:14:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1476210672,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.6b01398"],"pmid":"27726350","pubdate":"2016-10-12T22:05:50+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis of MAX Phases in the Hf\u2013Al\u2013C System","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-max-phases-hf-al-c-system"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7523579,"mean":6.5040957411445,"rank":5430569,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1828341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7523579,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":239022,"mean":12.448282954217,"rank":154912,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":72475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":239022,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8661,"mean":1.1109150115473,"rank":3093,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":4905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8661,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":339,"mean":1.0031065088757,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":339,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
