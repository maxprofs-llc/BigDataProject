Among them one patient combined with congenital scoliosis, one with atlas neoplasm, one with atlantoaxial dislocation, and the rest one with atlantoaxial fracture-dislocation. The data of the diseased region was collected from computerized tomography scans for 3D digital reconstruction and rapid prototyping to prepare photosensitive resin models, which were applied in the treatment of these cases.\nThe use of 3D models reduced operating time and intraoperative blood loss as well as the risk of postoperative complications. Furthermore, no pedicle penetrations or screw misplacement occurred according to the postoperative planar radiographic images.\nThe tactile models from 3D printing allow direct observation and measurement, helping the orthopedists to have accurate morphometric information to provide personalized surgical planning and better communication with the patient and coworkers. Moreover, the photosensitive resin models can also guide the actual surgery with the drilling of pedicle screws and safe resection of tumor.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e9a","authors":["Wang, Yi-Tian","Yang, Xin-Jian","Yan, Bin","Zeng, Teng-Hui","Qiu, Yi-Yan","Chen, Si-Jin"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T12:59:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1008-1275"],"issue":"1","journal":"Chinese Journal of Traumatology","last_mentioned_on":1459772841,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27033270"],"pmid":"27033270","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Clinical application of three-dimensional printing in the personalized treatment of complex spinal disorders.","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-application-threedimensional-printing-personalized-treatment-complex-spinal-disorders-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7492829,"mean":6.4903949042968,"rank":6490038,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7492829,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272155,"mean":11.161236836497,"rank":230109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272155,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":3.64875,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.55,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NIHL3D\/statuses\/716965380095348736","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6465396],"posted_on":"2016-04-04T12:27:21+00:00","author":{"name":"NIHL 3D Printing","url":"http:\/\/nihlibrary.nih.gov","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/535844758770311168\/TEZkAxsL_normal.png","description":"National Institutes of Health Library","id_on_source":"NIHL3D","tweeter_id":"2887052859","geo":{"lt":38.98067,"ln":-77.10026,"country":"US"},"followers":749},"tweet_id":"716965380095348736"}]}}
