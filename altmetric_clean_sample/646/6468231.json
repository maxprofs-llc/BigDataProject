Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG, also known in US as carbidopa-levodopa enteral suspension, CLES) is continuously infused directly to the proximal small intestine via PEG-J in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) to overcome slow and erratic gastric emptying and treat motor fluctuations that are not adequately controlled by oral or other pharmacological therapy.\nAn independent adjudication committee of three experienced (>25 years each) gastroenterologists reviewed gastrointestinal procedure- and device-associated AEs reported for PD patients (total n=395) enrolled in phase 3 LCIG studies. The rate, clinical significance, and causality of the procedure\/device events were determined.\nThe patient median exposure to PEG-J at the data cutoff was 480 days. Procedure- and device-associated serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in 67 (17%) patients. A total of 42% of SAEs occurred during the first 4 weeks following PEG-J placement. SAEs of major clinical significance with the highest procedural incidence were peritonitis (1.5%), pneumonia (1.5%), and abdominal pain (1.3%). The most common non-serious procedure- and device-associated AEs were abdominal pain (31%), post-operative wound infection (20%), and procedural pain (23%). In all, 17 (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment owing to an AE.\nIn conclusion, incidences of PEG-J AEs with the LCIG delivery system and PEG-J longevity were compared favorably with ranges described in the PEG\/PEG-J literature. A low discontinuation rate in this study suggests acceptable procedural outcomes and AE rates in PD patients treated with this PEG-J drug delivery system.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8233cf058f61000be0e","authors":["Epstein, Michael","Johnson, David A","Hawes, Robert","Schmulewitz, Nathan","Vanagunas, Arvydas D","Gossen, E Roderich","Robieson, Weining Z","Eaton, Susan","Dubow, Jordan","Chatamra, Krai","Benesh, Janet"],"doi":"10.1038\/ctg.2016.19","first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T17:03:32+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2155-384X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology","last_mentioned_on":1459790440,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27030949"],"pmid":"27030949","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"e159","title":"Long-Term PEG-J Tube Safety in Patients With Advanced Parkinson\u2019s Disease","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/longterm-pegj-tube-safety-patients-advanced-parkinsons-disease-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7492829,"mean":6.4903949042968,"rank":3069640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4410247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7492829,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272155,"mean":11.161187783387,"rank":106343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":165158,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272155,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":107,"mean":6.2877735849057,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":107,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":4.0666666666667,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
