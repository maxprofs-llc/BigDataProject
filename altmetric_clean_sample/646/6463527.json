Here, we show that the ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(p-cymene)(bis(3,5-dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methane)Cl]Cl (UNICAM-1) exhibits potent in vivo antitumor effects. When administered as four-dose course, by repeating a single dose (52.4mg kg-1) every three days, UNICAM-1 significantly reduces the growth of A17 triple negative breast cancer cells transplanted into FVB syngeneic mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that UNICAM-1 is rapidly eliminated from kidney, liver and bloodstream thanks to its high hydrosolubility, exerting excellent therapeutic activity with minimal side effects. Immunohistological analysis revealed that the efficacy of UNICAM-1, mainly relies on its capacity to reverse tumor-associated immune suppression by significantly reducing the number of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells. Therefore, UNICAM-1 appears very promising for the treatment of TNBC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f6100032df","authors":["Montani, Maura","Pazmay, Gretta V Badillo","Hysi, Albana","Lupidi, Giulio","Pettinari, Riccardo","Gambini, Valentina","Tilio, Martina","Marchetti, Fabio","Pettinari, Claudio","Ferraro, Stefano","Iezzi, Manuela","Marchini, Cristina","Amici, Augusto"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.phrs.2016.03.032","first_seen_on":"2016-04-04T11:12:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-1186","10436618"],"journal":"Pharmacological Research","last_mentioned_on":1459764995,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27038531?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27038531","pubdate":"2016-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The Water Soluble Ruthenium(II) Organometallic Compound [Ru(p-cymene)(bis(3,5 dimethylpyrazol-1-yl)methane)Cl]Cl Suppresses Triple Negative Breast Cancer Growth by Inhibiting Tumor Infiltration of Regulatory T Cells","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/water-soluble-rutheniumii-organometallic-compound-rupcymenebis35-dimethylpyrazol1ylmethaneclcl-suppr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7492829,"mean":6.4903949042968,"rank":6490030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7492829,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":272154,"mean":11.161264068373,"rank":230103,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":272154,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":701,"mean":5.17008,"rank":555,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":701,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":3.8267777777778,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
