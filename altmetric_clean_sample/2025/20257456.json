Inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation might be a potential strategy for neurodegeneration. Matairesinol, a dibenzylbutyrolactone plant lignan, presents in a wide variety of foodstuffs. It has been found to possess anti-angiogenic, anti-oxidative, anti-cancer and anti-fungal activities. In the present study, we investigated the anti-neuroinflammation effects of matairesinol on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglia cells and the related molecular mechanisms. The results showed that matairesinol inhibited microglia activation by reducing the production of nitric oxide, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in a concentration-dependent manner (6.25, 12.5, 25\u00a0\u03bcM). In the molecular signaling pathway, LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) transcriptional activity and translocation into the nucleus were remarkably suppressed by matairesinol through the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1\/2 signal transduction pathways, but not p38 MAPK or c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Meanwhile, matairesinol also blocked LPS-mediated microglia migration and this was associated with inhibition of LPS-induced Src phosphorylation as well as Src expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that matairesinol inhibited inflammatory response and migration in LPS-induced BV2 microglia, and the mechanisms may be associated with the NF-\u03baB activation and modulation of Src pathway.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003191","authors":["Xu, Peng","Huang, Meng-Wei","Xiao, Chen-Xi","Long, Fen","Wang, Ying","Liu, Si-Yu","Jia, Wan-Wan","Wu, Wei-Jun","Yang, Di","Hu, Jin-Feng","Liu, Xin-Hua","Zhu, Yi-Zhun"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11064-017-2301-1","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T10:50:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0364-3190","1573-6903"],"journal":"Neurochemical Research","last_mentioned_on":1495104615,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28512713?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28512713","pubdate":"2017-05-18T22:04:31+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Matairesinol Suppresses Neuroinflammation and Migration Associated with Src and ERK1\/2-NF-\u03baB Pathway in Activating BV2 Microglia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/matairesinol-suppresses-neuroinflammation-migration-associated-src-erk12nf%CE%BAb-pathway-activating-bv2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116914,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234026,"mean":12.379355846597,"rank":190332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234026,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1078,"mean":2.8719721448468,"rank":734,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1078,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":2.2336734693878,"rank":31,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MltplSclppr\/statuses\/865157578711375872","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20257456],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T10:50:15+00:00","author":{"name":"MS Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/599614030790008833\/7IuEjHC7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"MltplSclppr","tweeter_id":"3262004991","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":211},"tweet_id":"865157578711375872"}]}}
