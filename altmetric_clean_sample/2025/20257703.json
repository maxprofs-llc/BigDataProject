Here we examined the role of the Ca(2+) signaling in the NO-induced CM differentiation of mouse ES cells. We found that NO induced intracellular Ca(2+) increases in ES cells in a dose-dependent manner, and application of IP3 pathway antagonists not only significantly inhibited this induced Ca(2+) increase but also abolished NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells. Subsequently, all 3 types of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) in mouse ES cells were individually or triply knocked down. Interestingly, only knockdown of type 3 IP3R (IP3R3) or triple-knockdown of three types of IP3Rs significantly inhibited the NO-induced Ca(2+) increases. Consistently, IP3R3 knockdown blocked the NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells. CMs derived from IP3R3 knockdown ES cells also showed both structural and functional defects. In summary, our results indicate that the IP3R3-Ca(2+) pathway is required for NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002890","authors":["Wenjie Wei","Wei Huang","Jianbo Yue"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.yexcr.2016.06.016","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T10:53:23+00:00","issns":["00144827"],"issue":"1","journal":"Experimental Cell Research","last_mentioned_on":1495104787,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27349290?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27349290","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Requirement of IP3 receptor 3 (IP3R3) in nitric oxide induced cardiomyocyte differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells","type":"article","volume":"346","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/requirement-ip3-receptor-3-ip3r3-nitric-oxide-induced-cardiomyocyte-differentiation-mouse-embryonic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":4373689,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2283025,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234027,"mean":12.379304017502,"rank":129640,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":82432,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234027,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1442,"mean":2.3796932685635,"rank":798,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":468,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1442,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":1.2230769230769,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
