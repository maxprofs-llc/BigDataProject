However, little is known about the role of miR\u2011375 in the regulation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis and invasion. The present study measured the expression levels of miR\u2011375 in Tca8113, UM2, UM1 and CAL\u201127 cell lines, using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrated that miR\u2011375 expression levels were significantly reduced in UM1 and CAL\u201127 (highly metastatic) compared with Tca8113 and UM2 (less aggressive) OSCC cell lines. Furthermore, it was revealed that overexpression of miR\u2011375 suppressed the migration and invasion of UM1 cells. Based on a luciferase reporter assay, platelet\u2011derived growth factor\u2011A (PDGF\u2011A) was identified as a direct target gene of miR\u2011375. Additionally, overexpression of PDGF\u2011A significantly reversed the effect of miR\u2011375 on cell migration and invasion in UM1 cells. These data demonstrated that miR\u2011375 suppressed OSCC cell migration and invasion by targeting PDGF\u2011A, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of OSCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c8","authors":["Zheng\u2011Hao Cao","Jing\u2011Liang Cheng","Yong Zhang","Chun\u2011Xiao Bo","Yan\u2011Liang Li"],"doi":"10.3892\/mmr.2016.6057","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T06:05:16+00:00","issns":["1791-2997","1791-3004"],"journal":"Molecular Medicine Reports","last_mentioned_on":1495087504,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28000902?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28000902","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"MicroRNA\u2011375 inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma cell migration and invasion by targeting platelet\u2011derived growth factor\u2011A","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/microrna375-inhibits-oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma-cell-migration-invasion-targeting-plateletderived"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7116907,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":234026,"mean":12.379467373144,"rank":190335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":234026,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2100,"mean":1.60242115293,"rank":1059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2100,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":3.3949367088608,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
