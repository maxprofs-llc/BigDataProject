However, there is limited research on the role of social support in amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use among FSWs in China. This study explored the present situation of ATS use among FSWs in Guangxi, China and examined the associations of different types of social support from different sources with ATS use.\nA sample of 1022 FSWs was recruited from 56 commercial sex venues in Guangxi Autonomous Region in China. Bivariate comparison was used to compare demographic characteristics and source of emotional or tangible social support across frequency of ATS use among FSWs. The relationship between social support and ATS use was examined using multiple ordinal logistic regression models controlling for the potential confounding effects of demographic variables.\nThe multiple ordinal logistic regression indicated that FSWs who were from younger age groups (aOR\u2009=\u200910.88 for age group <20; aOR\u2009=\u20092.80 for age group 20-23), and from all higher-income venues (aOR\u2009=\u20091.96 for venue level 1; aOR\u2009=\u20092.28 for venue level 2; aOR\u2009=\u20091.81 for venue level 3) tended to use ATS more frequently. They also tended to use ATS more frequently when they depended on their boyfriends (aOR\u2009=\u20091.08) for emotional support or on their co-workers for tangible support (aOR\u2009=\u20091.17).\nDifferent types of social support from different sources can be either positively or negatively associated with ATS use among FSWs, therefore, the future intervention efforts should differentiate and target different types and different sources of social support in response to the living and work conditions of FSWs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Qun Zhao","Yuchen Mao","Xiaoming Li","Yuejiao Zhou","Zhiyong Shen"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2017.1328101","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T10:56:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0954-0121","1360-0451"],"journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1497913239,"links":["http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/09540121.2017.1328101?ai=se&mi=79r7c4&af=R","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28514866"],"pmid":"28514866","pubdate":"2017-05-19T22:09:03+00:00","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Social support and amphetamine-type stimulant use among female sex workers in China","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/social-support-amphetaminetype-stimulant-among-female-sex-workers-china"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.83,"score_history":{"1y":8.83,"6m":8.83,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.83},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":1034835,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7356276,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244294,"mean":12.659885997552,"rank":44478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":199737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244294,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1675,"mean":3.9202234169654,"rank":143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1531,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1675,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":54,"mean":8.2996226415094,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":30,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":54,"percentile":55}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":5}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Social support and amphetamine-type stimulant use among female sex workers in China","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/social-support-and-amphetamine-type-stimulant-use-among-female-sex-workers-in-china\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[20257777],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T10:53:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nSource&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;\nSocial support and amphetamine-type stimulant use among female sex workers in China\nThe post Social support and amphetamine-type stimulant use among female sex workers in China was curated by information for practice.","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Sex_Worker_Hlth\/statuses\/868570027678736389","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20257777],"posted_on":"2017-05-27T20:50:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Sex_Worker_Hlth","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781973423\/ruth-palmer-deep-purple-mist_normal.jpg","description":"Commercial Sex Worker Health Information.
