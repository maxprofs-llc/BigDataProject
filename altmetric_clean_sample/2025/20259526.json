A convenience sampling method was used to recruit the required sample. Another 140 subjects were selected from the community as a control group (non-users of warfarin).\nThis study showed that more than three-quarter patients (82%) were at high risk of abnormal BMD. The warfarin users were two times more likely to have a higher osteoporosis risk compared to control group. Moreover, BMD has a negative correlation with age, but has a positive correlation with Body Mass Index (BMI). Patients showed a negative correlation with a higher dose of warfarin intake.\nThis study concluded that osteopenia and osteoporosis are serious problems between users and non-users warfarin in Penang. Therefore, it should be taken into consideration in the Malaysian Health Ministry's agenda.","authors":["Aseel Hadi Abdulameer"],"doi":"10.7860\/jcdr\/2017\/23829.9483","first_seen_on":"2017-05-18T11:22:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2249782X","2249-782X"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR","last_mentioned_on":1495106530,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28511429"],"pmcid":"PMC5427355","pmid":"28511429","pubdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"An Assessment of Osteoporotic Conditions among Users and Non-Users of Warfarin: A Case-Control Study","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessment-osteoporotic-conditions-among-users-nonusers-warfarin-casecontrol-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SteveWMorrissey\/statuses\/865165612313710594","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20259526],"posted_on":"2017-05-18T11:22:10+00:00","author":{"name":"Steve Morrissey","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/606567723183820801\/uGVmcRRh_normal.jpg","description":"MSc Medicinal Chemistry.
