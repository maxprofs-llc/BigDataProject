However, there were several goal themes that were not captured by items on standardised outcome measures. These seemed to be related to existential factors such as understanding, thinking about oneself and future planning.\nThis presents a powerful framework for how clinicians can use goals to help select a standardised outcome measure (where this is helpful) in addition to the use of a goal-based outcome measure and personalise choices. There may be areas not captured by standardised outcome measures that may be important for children and young people and which may only be currently captured in goal measurement. There is an indication that we may not be measuring what is important to children and young people. We may need to develop or look for new measures that capture these areas.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002553","authors":["Jacob, J"],"doi":"10.1177\/1359104515615642","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T14:50:47+00:00","issns":["1461-7021","1359-1045"],"journal":"Clinical Child Psychology & Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1469026228,"links":["http:\/\/discovery.ucl.ac.uk\/1476761\/"],"pmid":"26721283","pubdate":"2015-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry","psychology","pediatrics"],"title":"Measuring what matters to patients: Using goal content to inform measure choice and development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/measuring-matters-patients-using-goal-content-inform-measure-choice-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8085102,"mean":6.8782317593723,"rank":7000194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8085102,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257817,"mean":11.979461360039,"rank":217979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257817,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":347,"mean":3.3638786127168,"rank":296,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":347,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":3.88125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
