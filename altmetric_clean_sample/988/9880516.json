Overall, half of the women underwent caesarean section. A high incidence of postoperative complications (39%) was observed after caesarean section with no difference between the groups. Surgical difficulties at newborn extraction (22%) and postoperative complications (39%) occurred more often in women with anterior deep infiltrating endometriosis (respectively 63 versus 11%, P = 0.007 and 67% versus 26%, P = 0.046) independently of prior surgery for endometriosis. In the remaining half, vaginal delivery required an operative procedure in 28% of the women with a significant increase in postpartum complications compared with those who did not require a procedure (P = 0.001). Overall, the incidence of postpartum complications was lower after vaginal delivery (14%) than after caesarean section (39%) (P = 0.03).\nPregnant women with colorectal endometriosis, irrespective of prior surgery, should be informed of the high risk of delivery by caesarean section. Vaginal delivery is preferrable in this setting because of the lower incidence of postpartum complications.\nDue to the incidence of postpartum complications whatever the route of delivery, women should receive level III maternal care.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244e","authors":["Thomin, A","Belghiti, J","David, C","Marty, O","Bornes, M","Ballester, M","Roman, H","Dara\u00ef, E","A Thomin","J Belghiti","C David","O Marty","M Bornes","M Ballester","H Roman","E Dara\u00ef"],"doi":"10.1111\/1471-0528.14221","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T13:01:53+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-0528","14700328"],"journal":"British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology","last_mentioned_on":1493854426,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27428865","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.14221\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/1471-0528.14221","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27428865"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1471-0528.14221\/pdf","pmid":"27428865","pubdate":"2016-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with colorectal endometriosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maternal-neonatal-outcomes-women-colorectal-endometriosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8150286,"mean":6.9044882123689,"rank":1980330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6131543,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8150286,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":258282,"mean":12.02203191098,"rank":80671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":176412,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":258282,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3448,"mean":7.7676495503336,"rank":1397,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3448,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101,"mean":9.7056,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":3}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726544993#1","license":"public","citation_ids":[9880516],"posted_on":"2016-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["good_for_teaching","new_finding"],"f1000_score":"3"},{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726544993","license":"public","citation_ids":[9880516],"posted_on":"2016-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["good_for_teaching","new_finding"],"f1000_score":"3"}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EndoUpdateBlog\/statuses\/755749367332601856","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[9880516],"posted_on":"2016-07-20T13:01:04+00:00","author":{"name":"EndometriosisUpdate","url":"http:\/\/endo-update.blogspot.co.uk\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2101914801\/Endoupdate_twitter_normal.jpg","description":"The is the official Twitter account for the Endometriosis Update Blog.
