Similarly, results from research in human learning and behavior have facilitated the development of best practices in simulation-based training (SBT) and surgical education. Today, SBT is a common curriculum component in surgical education that can significantly complement clinical learning, performance, and patient care experiences. Beginning with important considerations for selecting appropriate forms of simulation, several relevant educational theories of learning are described.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005cff","authors":["Chauvin, Sheila W"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.suc.2015.04.006","endpage":"715","first_seen_on":"2016-07-20T14:45:19+00:00","issns":["1558-3171","0039-6109"],"issue":"4","journal":"Surgical Clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1435197787,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=8&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.surgical.theclinics.com%2Farticle%2FS0039-6109%252815%252900047-X%2Fabstract%3Frss%3Dyes&code=suc-site"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.surgical.theclinics.com\/article\/S003961091500047X\/pdf","pmid":"26210964","pubdate":"2015-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"695","subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"Applying Educational Theory to Simulation-Based Training and Assessment in Surgery","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/applying-educational-theory-simulationbased-training-assessment-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5378630,"mean":6.2855994696804,"rank":4475410,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5378630,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88851,"mean":10.564140911649,"rank":68056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88851,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":304,"mean":1.738501650165,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":304,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
