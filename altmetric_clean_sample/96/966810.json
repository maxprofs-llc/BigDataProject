Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with UTI. Cats of all ages were affected by UTI with no sex\/breed predisposition. Lower urinary tract signs were absent in 35.5% of cats with UTI. Pyuria and bacteriuria had sensitivities of 52.9% and 72.9%, and specificities of 85.5% and 67.7% for detection of UTI, respectively. Risk factors significantly associated with increased odds of UTI were urinary incontinence [odds ratio (OR)=10.78, P=0.0331], transurethral procedures (OR=8.37, P<0.0001), urogenital surgery (OR=6.03, P=0.0385), gastrointestinal disease (OR=2.62, P=0.0331), decreased body weight (OR=0.81, P=0.0259) and decreased urine specific gravity (OR=0.78, P=0.0055). Whilst not independently significant, renal disease and lower urinary tract anatomic abnormalities improved statistical model performance and contributed to UTI.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c7f","authors":["John B Kaneene","Ivan Martinez-Ruzafa","John M Kruger","RoseAnn Miller","Cheryl L Swenson","Carole A Bolin"],"doi":"10.1177\/1098612x12451372","endpage":"740","first_seen_on":"2012-09-26T13:12:58+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1532-2750","1098-612X"],"issue":"10","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1364307809,"links":["http:\/\/jfm.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/10\/729.abstract?etoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jfm.sagepub.com\/content\/14\/10\/729.full.pdf","pmid":"22710859","pubdate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Transportation Research Board, National Research Council","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"729","title":"Clinical features and risk factors for development of urinary tract infections in cats","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-features-risk-factors-development-urinary-tract-infections-cats"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2281325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":2197454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":48},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79662,"mean":5.453969872334,"rank":36793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42257,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79662,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":741,"mean":2.5734081081081,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":464,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":741,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.5111111111111,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
