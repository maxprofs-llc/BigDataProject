Here, by using formaldehyde crosslinking in mammalian cell extracts, we demonstrate that the WRN helicase\/exonuclease defective in the premature aging disorder Werner syndrome (WS) is recruited to DNA duplex containing an 8-oxo-G:A mispair in a manner dependent on DNA polymerase \u03bb (Pol\u03bb) that catalyzes accurate DNA synthesis over 8-oxo-G. Similarly, by immunofluorescence, we show that Pol\u03bb is required for accumulation of WRN at sites of 8-oxo-G lesions in human cells. Moreover, we show that nuclear focus formation of WRN and Pol\u03bb induced by oxidative stress is dependent on ongoing DNA replication and on the presence of MUTYH. Cell viability assays reveal that depletion of MUTYH suppresses the hypersensitivity of cells lacking WRN and\/or Pol\u03bb to oxidative stress. Biochemical studies demonstrate that WRN binds to the catalytic domain of Pol\u03bb and specifically stimulates DNA gap filling by Pol\u03bb over 8-oxo-G followed by strand displacement synthesis. Our results suggest that WRN promotes long-patch DNA repair synthesis by Pol\u03bb during MUTYH-initiated repair of 8-oxo-G:A mispairs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000832f","authors":["Pavel Janscak","Radhakrishnan Kanagaraj","Prasanna Parasuraman","Boris Mihaljevic","Barbara van Loon","Kamila Burdova","Christiane K\u00f6nig","Antonia Furrer","Vilhelm A.
