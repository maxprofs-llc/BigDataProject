Although Brown and Levinson's theory of politeness (1978, 1987) is often cited, it is primarily a linguistic theory and has been criticized for its lack of generalizability to all cultures. Consequently, there is a need for a more comprehensive approach to understand and explain politeness. We suggest applying a social signal framework that considers politeness as a communicative state. By doing so, we aim to unify and explain politeness and its corresponding research and identify further research needed in this area.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6123cf058f610006f39","authors":["Brunet PM","Cowie R","Donnan H","Douglas-Cowie E"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10339-011-0418-8","first_seen_on":"2012-09-26T06:18:47+00:00","issns":["1612-4782"],"issue":"","journal":"Cognitive Processing","last_mentioned_on":1348640322,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21984311"],"pmid":"21984311","pubdate":"2011-10-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Artificial Intelligence (incl.
