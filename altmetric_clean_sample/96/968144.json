Dominant mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the most common cause of familial PD (Parkinson's disease). Additionally, in genome-wide association studies, the LRRK2 locus has been linked to risk of PD, Crohn's disease and leprosy, and LRRK2 has also been linked with cancer. Despite its association with human disease, very little is known about its pathophysiology. Recent reports suggest a functional association between LRRK2 and autophagy. Implications of this set of data for our understanding of LRRK2's role in physiology and disease are discussed in the present paper.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023c4","authors":["Manzoni C"],"doi":"10.1042\/bst20120126","first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T06:17:22+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc"],"issns":["0300-5127"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biochemical Society Transactions","last_mentioned_on":1348726634,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22988880?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22988880","pubdate":"2012-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"LRRK2 and autophagy: a common pathway for disease.","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lrrk2-autophagy-common-pathway-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":2743377,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":734756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76321,"mean":5.1077257075471,"rank":50984,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":19895,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76321,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":622,"mean":2.258305958132,"rank":437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":169,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":622,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.95,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
