To investigate the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on atherogenesis, we studied 75 cholesterol-fed female rabbits for 19 wk. The rabbits were randomly assigned to five groups. Four groups underwent bilateral ovariectomy followed by treatment with either 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol plus norethisterone acetate, 17 beta-estradiol plus levonorgestrel, or placebo. The fifth group had a sham operation and received placebo. The hormone groups had only one-third of the aortic accumulation of cholesterol found in the placebo groups, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). No significant differences in aortic accumulation of cholesterol were found in the hormone groups. This indicates that estrogen attenuates atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits and that two commonly prescribed progestogens do not counteract the effect. The beneficial effect of estradiol could only partly be explained by its lowering effects on serum total cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol, which implies that estradiol possesses additional beneficial effects, possibly a direct action on the arterial wall.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["J Haarbo","P Leth-Espensen","S Stender","C Christiansen"],"doi":"10.1172\/jci115129","first_seen_on":"2012-09-24T18:14:25+00:00","issns":["0021-9738"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Clinical Investigation","last_mentioned_on":1348505089,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC295153\/"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC295153\/pdf\/jcinvest00058-0148.pdf","pmcid":"PMC295153","pmid":"1901319","pubdate":"1991-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Clinical Investigation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1274","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Estrogen monotherapy and combined estrogen-progestogen replacement therapy attenuate aortic accumulation of cholesterol in ovariectomized cholesterol-fed rabbits.","type":"article","volume":"87","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/estrogen-monotherapy-combined-estrogenprogestogen-replacement-therapy-attenuate-aortic-accumulation"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3081732,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":963945,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79542,"mean":5.4265214920607,"rank":51588,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79542,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691,"mean":9.1671931769723,"rank":3940,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":632,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":7.8599029126214,"rank":85,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
