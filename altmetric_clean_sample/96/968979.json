The overall increase in home births was driven mostly by a 36% increase for non-Hispanic white women. About 1 out of every 90 births to non-Hispanic white women are now home births. The percentage of home births for non-Hispanic white women was three to five times higher than for any other racial or ethnic group. Home births have a lower risk profile than hospital births, with fewer births to teenagers or unmarried women, and with fewer preterm, low birthweight, and multiple births. The lower risk profile of home compared with hospital births suggests that home birth attendants are selecting low-risk women as candidates for home birth. The increase in the percentage of home births from 2004 to 2009 was widespread and involved selected states from every region of the country. The large variations in the percentage of home births by state may be influenced by differences among states in laws pertaining to births are more prevalent among non-Hispanic white women (7). midwifery practice or out-of-hospital birth (8,9), as well as by differences in the racial and ethnic composition of state populations, as home Studies have suggested that most home births are intentional or planned home births, whereas others are unintentional or unplanned, because of an emergency situation (i.e., precipitous labor, labor complications, or unable to get to the hospital in time) (3,6). Although not representative of all U.S. births (see \"Data source and methods\"), 87% of home births in a 26-state reporting area (comprising 50% of U.S. births) were planned in 2009. For non-Hispanic white women, 93% of home births were planned (10). Women may prefer a home birth over a hospital birth for a variety of reasons, including a desire for a low-intervention birth in a familiar environment surrounded by family and friends, and cultural or religious concerns (9,11). Lack of transportation in rural areas and cost factors may also play a role, as home births cost about one-third as much as hospital births (9,11,12).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9133cf058f61000ccba","authors":["Macdorman MF","Mathews TJ","Declercq E"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T14:13:10+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"84","journal":"NCHS data brief","last_mentioned_on":1348839458,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22617638"],"pmid":"22617638","pubdate":"2012-05-25T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","statisticsastopic"],"title":"Home births in the United States, 1990-2009.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/home-births-united-states-19902009"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":2956862,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1412066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79712,"mean":5.4294303421108,"rank":49114,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":27944,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79712,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72,"mean":5.1453802816901,"rank":40,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.75,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
