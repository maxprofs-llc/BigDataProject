(2) In patients who have an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of \u03b2-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy? (3) In patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for ED management? Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed based on the strength of the available data in the medical literature. A literature search was also performed for a critical question from the 2003 clinical policy.(1) Is the administration of anti-D immunoglobulin indicated among Rh-negative women during the first trimester of pregnancy with threatened abortion, complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or minor abdominal trauma? Because no new, high-quality articles were found, the management recommendations from the previous policy are discussed in the introduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005724","authors":["Fesmire, Francis M.","Hahn SA","Lavonas EJ","Mace SE","Napoli AM","Fesmire FM"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.annemergmed.2012.04.021","first_seen_on":"2012-09-23T04:45:47+00:00","issns":["0196-0644","01960644"],"issue":"3","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1459861200,"links":["http:\/\/www.annemergmed.com\/article\/S0196-0644(12)00406-4\/fulltext","https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?rc=9&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.annemergmed.com%2Farticle%2FS0196-0644%252812%252900406-4%2Ffulltext&code=ymem-site","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22921048"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.annemergmed.com\/article\/S0196-0644(12)00406-4\/pdf","pmid":"22921048","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["emergencymedicine"],"title":"Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Initial Evaluation and Management of Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department in Early Pregnancy","type":"article","volume":"60","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-policy-critical-issues-initial-evaluation-management-patients-presenting-emergency-departme-14"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14.4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7499955,"mean":6.4950193838481,"rank":496470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":7002901,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7499955,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99113,"mean":5.7108834651707,"rank":6513,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":92593,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99113,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3149,"mean":13.140523506989,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2628,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3149,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":13.023928571429,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":79}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
