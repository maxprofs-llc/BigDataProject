The origin of the biceps femoris muscle attaches to the pelvis at the ischial tuberosity and to the sacrum via the sacrotuberous ligament. The biomechanics of the sacroiliac joint and hip, along with lumbar-pelvic stability, therefore play a significant role in hamstring function. Pelvic asymmetry and\/or excessive anterior tilt can lead to increased tension at the biceps origin and increase functional demands on the hamstring group by inhibiting its synergists. Joint proprioceptive mechanisms may play a significant role in re-establishing balance between agonists and antagonists. An appreciation of neuromuscular connections as well as overall lumbar-pelvic structural assessment is recommended in conjunction with lumbar-pelvic strengthening exercises to help resolve chronic hamstring strain.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f6100059fc","authors":["Panayi, Stephanie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jbmt.2009.08.004","first_seen_on":"2012-09-22T20:36:04+00:00","issns":["1360-8592","13608592"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Bodywork & Movement Therapies","last_mentioned_on":1440010771,"links":["http:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(09)00116-8\/abstract","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1360859209001168"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.bodyworkmovementtherapies.com\/article\/S1360-8592(09)00116-8\/pdf","pmid":"20538228","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["physicalandrehabilitationmedicine"],"title":"The need for lumbar\u2013pelvic assessment in the resolution of chronic hamstring strain ","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/need-lumbarpelvic-assessment-resolution-chronic-hamstring-strain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6242641,"mean":5.955027742431,"rank":2048440,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4167847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6242641,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85864,"mean":5.8720649639542,"rank":25056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":60378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85864,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":632,"mean":3.7427955625991,"rank":209,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":418,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":632,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":5.3166666666667,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
