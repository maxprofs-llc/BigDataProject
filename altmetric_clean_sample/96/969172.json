Much of this decline has been attributed to widespread use of cytology screening followed by treatment of precancerous lesions. Despite available technologies to prevent ICC and screening programs targeting high-risk women, certain populations in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of ICC (e.g., racial\/ethnic minorities and rural women). Limited access to and use of screening\/follow-up services underlie this disparity. The licensure of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006 introduced an additional method of ICC prevention. Unfortunately, dissemination of the vaccine to age-eligible females has been lower than expected (32% have received all 3 recommended doses). Decreasing the burden of HPV infection and HPV-related diseases in the United States will require greater dissemination of the HPV vaccine to adolescents and young adults, along with successful implementation of revised ICC screening guidelines that incorporate HPV and cytology cotesting. While a future without ICC is possible, we will need a comprehensive national health care program and innovative approaches to reduce ICC burden and disparities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006dcc","authors":["Anna R.
