Because tumor size is also prognostic and is associated with SUV(max), we sought to better characterize their relationship. We hypothesize that the ratio of SUV(max) to tumor size is a clinically useful measurement.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Stiles, Brendon M","Nasar, Abu","Mirza, Farooq","Paul, Subroto","Lee, Paul C","Port, Jeffrey L","McGraw, Timothy E","Altorki, Nasser K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2012.07.038","first_seen_on":"2012-09-25T20:58:04+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1552-6259"],"issue":"2","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1348602610,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23000262"],"pmid":"23000262","pubdate":"2012-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Ratio of Positron Emission Tomography Uptake to Tumor Size in Surgically Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","type":"article","volume":"95","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ratio-positron-emission-tomography-uptake-tumor-size-surgically-resected-nonsmall-cell-lung-cancer-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627387,"mean":4.9489064262842,"rank":2018369,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":932378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627387,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76272,"mean":5.143280067129,"rank":36495,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26974,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76272,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1681,"mean":1.6831047619048,"rank":542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":965,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1681,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89,"mean":0.75897727272727,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":76,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"googleplus":[{"url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/110191591883713665565\/posts\/NGvekRp2wfk","citation_ids":[965510],"posted_on":"2012-09-25T19:50:10+00:00","summary":"Ratio of Positron Emission Tomography Uptake to Tumor Size in Surgically Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23000262 Ann Thorac Surg. 2012 Sep 20. pii: S0003-4975(12)01650-5. doi: 10.1016\/j.athoracsur.2012.07.038.
