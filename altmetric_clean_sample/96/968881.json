TTP is associated with multisystem symptoms, such as thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, central nervous system involvement, and fever. TTP is idiopathic in about 37% of the cases and can be associated with autoimmune diseases in 13% of the cases. Autoimmune disease-associated TTP can be refractory to plasma exchange and requires immunosuppressive therapy. We report a case of a previously healthy 55-year-old African American female who presented with shortness of breath, hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of TTP was made, and plasmapheresis was initiated. However, recurrence happened 48 hours after plasmapheresis was stopped. Autoimmune workup for refractory TTP revealed positive antinuclear antibodies, Anti-SSA, and Anti-SSB. Lip biopsy revealed findings consistent with Sjogren syndrome. Treatment with Rituximab was started, and significant clinical and laboratory response was achieved. The patient remained asymptomatic thereafter. A high clinical suspicion of autoimmune diseases is important as TTP tends to be refractory to plasma exchange in these cases, and immunosuppressive therapy is a key.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005717","doi":"10.1097\/mjt.0b013e3182459aa0","first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T13:52:00+00:00","issns":["1075-2765"],"issue":"","journal":"American journal of therapeutics (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1351563309,"links":["http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/americantherapeutics\/9000\/00000\/Refractory_Thrombotic_Thrombocytopenic_Purpura.99481.pdf?utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=twitterfeed"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/americantherapeutics\/9000\/00000\/Refractory_Thrombotic_Thrombocytopenic_Purpura.99481.pdf","pmid":"23011161","pubdate":"2012-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"","title":"Refractory Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Associated With Primary Sjogren Syndrome Treated With Rituximab: A Case Report","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/refractory-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-associated-primary-sjogren-syndrome-treated-rituximab-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":2939240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1425490,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79712,"mean":5.4350130094968,"rank":48910,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28035,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79712,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":1.6482821576763,"rank":224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":0.78809523809524,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Refractory Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Associated Wi... : American Journal of Therapeutics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=407792405956690&id=232452153440171","citation_ids":[968881],"posted_on":"2012-10-30T02:15:09+00:00","summary":"Most Popular:","author":{"name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/232452153440171","facebook_wall_name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/232452153440171\/picture","id_on_source":"232452153440171"}},{"title":"Refractory Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Associated Wi... : American Journal of Therapeutics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=483720484984754&id=232452153440171","citation_ids":[968881],"posted_on":"2012-09-26T23:24:45+00:00","summary":"PAP:","author":{"name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/232452153440171","facebook_wall_name":"American Journal of Therapeutics","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/232452153440171\/picture","id_on_source":"232452153440171"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AmJThera\/statuses\/263101692889927681","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[968881],"posted_on":"2012-10-30T02:15:06+00:00","author":{"name":"AmJThera","url":"http:\/\/americantherapeutics.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1407996256\/XLargeThumb_00045391-201105000-00000_CV_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"AmJThera","tweeter_id":"288951596","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":19},"tweet_id":"263101692889927681"}]}}
