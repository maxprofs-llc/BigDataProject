What is little known and understood however is the history of the apparently safe and effective use of MDMA as a therapeutic tool for psychotherapy. In this paper the author explores this history and describes the recent re-emergence of scientific interest in MDMA and other psychedelic drugs. There are currently several new double-blind randomised controlled trials underway re-visiting the subject. By acknowledging the limitations of this new research and emphasising the importance of exercising appropriate but realistic caution, the author asks that the medical profession consider a dispassionate and open-minded debate to examine whether MDMA might have a legitimate place as an adjunct to psychotherapy in modern psychiatric practice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002eeb","authors":["Ben Sessa"],"doi":"10.1177\/0269881107069029","endpage":"224","first_seen_on":"2012-09-26T21:47:37+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1461-7285"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Psychopharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1348710998,"links":["http:\/\/jop.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/2\/220.short"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jop.sagepub.com\/content\/21\/2\/220.full.pdf","pmid":"17329304","pubdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["psychopharmacology"],"title":"Is there a case for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the UK?","type":"article","volume":"21","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-mdmaassisted-psychotherapy-uk"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.78,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.78},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":374129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":4662851,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82479,"mean":5.7333946264459,"rank":6374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":76104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82479,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":786,"mean":9.6033095541401,"rank":98,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":688,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":786,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":16.827285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Student  > Ph.
