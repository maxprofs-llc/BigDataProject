How to manage the primary tumour is an important part of palliation. A small proportion of these patients present with either obstructing or perforating cancers and require urgent surgical care. However, a majority are relatively asymptomatic from their primary cancer. Chemotherapy has been shown to prolong survival in this group of patients, and a majority of patients would be treated this way. Nonetheless, A recent meta-analysis (Stillwell 2010) suggests an improved overall survival and reduced requirement for emergency surgery in those patients who undergo primary tumour resection. This review was also able to quantify the mortality and morbidity associated with surgery to remove the primary.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cc8c","authors":["Cirocchi R","Trastulli S","Abraha I","Vettoretto N","Boselli C","Montedori A","Parisi A","Noya G","Platell C"],"doi":"10.1002\/14651858.cd008997.pub2","first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T20:16:37+00:00","issns":["1465-1858",""],"journal":"Cochrane database of systematic reviews","last_mentioned_on":1350981601,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD008997.pub2\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD008997.pub2\/pdf","pmid":"22895981","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Non\u00e2\u0080\u0090resection versus resection for an asymptomatic primary tumour in patients with unresectable Stage IV colorectal cancer","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonresection-versus-resection-asymptomatic-primary-tumour-patients-unresectable-stage-iv-colorectal-8"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2919918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1437582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79713,"mean":5.483551384986,"rank":47778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79713,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7249,"mean":10.798019039735,"rank":6230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":909,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7249,"percentile":12},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":8.9082028985507,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
