A folic acid-conjugated copolymer, folic acid-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lactide) (FA-PEG-PLA), with similar chemical structure was chosen for targeting. Multifunctional micelles were successfully prepared by a coassembling method. In vitro evaluation was performed by using SKOV-3 and MCF-7 cancer cells. In vivo blood clearance of platinum was studied, and the results show that micelles exhibit longer blood circulation after iv injection. Pt biodistribution was studied by measuring its levels in plasma, organs, and tumors, especially in tumor cell DNA, by atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Antitumor activity was assessed in mice bearing H22 liver cancers, and the results showed that the micelles with FA moieties exhibited greater antitumor efficacy than those without FA or oxaliplatin. Therefore, these novel multifunctional platinum micelles have great potential in future clinical application.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c9","authors":["Rui Wang"],"doi":"10.1021\/mp3002914","first_seen_on":"2012-09-22T13:59:09+00:00","issns":["1543-8384"],"journal":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1348322340,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/mp3002914"],"pmid":"22954154","pubdate":"2012-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pharmacology"],"title":"Biological Characterization of Folate-Decorated Biodegradable Polymer\u2013Platinum(II) Complex Micelles","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biological-characterization-folatedecorated-biodegradable-polymerplatinumii-complex-micelles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3081779,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":963959,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79092,"mean":5.4494247891669,"rank":51323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79092,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":651,"mean":2.3169261538462,"rank":325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":651,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46,"mean":0.76844444444444,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
