Recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and electroencephalography\/magnetoencephalography can be employed to explore the topological organization of human brain networks. However, little is known about whether functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a relatively new optical imaging technology, can be used to map functional connectome of the human brain and reveal meaningful and reproducible topological characteristics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Haijing Niu","Jinhui Wang","Tengda Zhao","Ni Shu","Yong He"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0045771","first_seen_on":"2012-09-24T21:31:14+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1348522260,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045771"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0045771.pdf","pmid":"23029235","pubdate":"2012-09-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e45771","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Revealing Topological Organization of Human Brain Functional Networks with Resting-State Functional near Infrared Spectroscopy","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/revealing-topological-organization-human-brain-functional-networks-restingstate-functional-near-infr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3081726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":963936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79541,"mean":5.4266004023133,"rank":51587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79541,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80036,"mean":8.2965760979572,"rank":55842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16347,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80036,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3716,"mean":6.4469275908479,"rank":2550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3716,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":10,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
