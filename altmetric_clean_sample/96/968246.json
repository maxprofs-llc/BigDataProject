The process has been made reversible, regenerating the initial library upon phase reunification. It represents the behavior of a dynamic covalent library upon reversible phase separation and its adaptation to a phase change, with up-regulation in each phase of the fittest constituents by component selection. Finally, the system exemplifies the splitting of a 2D (square) constitutional dynamic network into a 3D (cube) one.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Nema Hafezi"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja305379c","first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T08:24:26+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1348734258,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja305379c"],"pmid":"22783895","pubdate":"2012-07-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Adaptation of Dynamic Covalent Systems of Imine Constituents to Medium Change by Component Redistribution under Reversible Phase Separation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adaptation-dynamic-covalent-systems-imine-constituents-medium-change-component-redistribution-under"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3081638,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":963809,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79713,"mean":5.4349510989562,"rank":51677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18031,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79713,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1151220520773,"rank":11958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":464,"mean":3.9207257019438,"rank":346,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":78,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":464,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
