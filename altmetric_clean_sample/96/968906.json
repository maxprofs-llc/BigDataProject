Catatonic features are often difficult to apprise in this context. This can result in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) discontinuation, although it remains the most effective treatment of catatonia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c4f","doi":"10.1097\/yct.0b013e3181c18a8c","first_seen_on":"2012-09-27T14:03:36+00:00","issns":["1095-0680"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Journal of ECT","last_mentioned_on":1348594919,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/Abstract\/2010\/09000\/Electroconvulsive_Therapy_Responsive_Catatonia_in.15.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ectjournal\/2010\/09000\/Electroconvulsive_Therapy_Responsive_Catatonia_in.15.pdf","pmid":"19935089","pubdate":"2010-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"234","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Electroconvulsive Therapy-Responsive Catatonia in a Medically Complicated Patient","type":"article","volume":"26","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/electroconvulsive-therapyresponsive-catatonia-medically-complicated-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634284,"mean":4.9206846148246,"rank":2897651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":82668,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634284,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76316,"mean":5.1136854615737,"rank":56399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":521,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76316,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":711,"mean":1.5831014084507,"rank":624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":711,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.83695652173913,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
