The probed reactions are strictly limited to the partly-hydrogenated form of graphene in which most of the hydrogen atoms are located in activated benzylic\/allylic positions. This, in turn, clearly demonstrates the presence of hydrogen attached to the graphene lattice. Attachment of the benzyl group was also unequivocally exhibited by characteristic vibrations recorded in the surface-enhanced Raman spectra, and all reactions were shown to proceed solely on hydrogenated graphene as evidenced by the comparison with pristine CVD graphene.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","authors":["Drogowska, Karolina","Kovaricek, Petr","Kalbac, Martin","Kova\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, Petr","Kalb\u00e1\u010d, Martin"],"doi":"10.1002\/chem.201605385","first_seen_on":"2016-12-18T14:50:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-3765","09476539"],"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","last_mentioned_on":1494027816,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605385\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605385\/abstract;jsessionid=0591A6F7031C2B7BC0EBFC48F70AD66E.f03t01?systemMessage=WOL+Usage+report+download+page+will+be+unavailable+on+Friday+27th+January+2017+at+23%3A00+GMT%2F+18%3A00+EST%2F+07%3A00+SGT+%28Saturday+28th+Jan+for+SGT%29++for+up+to+2+hours+due+to+essential+server+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/chem.201605385"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201605385\/pdf","pmid":"27984666","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"FUNCTIONALIZATION OF HYDROGENATED CHEMICAL VAPOUR DEPOSITION-GROWN GRAPHENE: THE ON-SURFACE CHEMICAL REACTIONS.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/chem.201605385","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/functionalization-hydrogenated-chemical-vapour-depositiongrown-graphene-onsurface-chemical-reactions"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.1,"score_history":{"1y":11.1,"6m":9.85,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8161014,"mean":6.911576885363,"rank":741091,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7417918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8161014,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264136,"mean":12.295510220152,"rank":37298,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":226687,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264136,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6037,"mean":3.1096848906561,"rank":229,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":5805,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6037,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":672,"mean":3.2787213114754,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":672,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":2,"Physics and Astronomy":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CZ":1,"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NanocarbonGroup\/statuses\/810495747309367297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[14836374],"posted_on":"2016-12-18T14:43:39+00:00","author":{"name":"Nanocarbon Group","url":"http:\/\/www.nanocarbon.cz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669909550691037184\/8VUc98iF_normal.jpg","description":"The Nanocarbon Group at the Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry, ASCR Prague.
