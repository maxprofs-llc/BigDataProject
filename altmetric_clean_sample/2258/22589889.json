A secondary end point was to assess the toxicity of chronic IFN administration.\nOne hundred seventy-one of 215 eligible patients achieved an objective response and were eligible to receive rIFN alpha-2a (3 million units [MU]\/m2 subcutaneously three times per week escalated to 9 MU\/m2 as tolerated) or observation for 2 years.\nOne hundred thirty-two of 140 registered patients were eligible. Sixty-four patients were randomized to receive IFN and 68 to observation alone. The median time from randomization to progression was 9 months on the IFN arm and 10 months on the observation arm (P = .72). The overall median survival time was 16 months on the observation arm versus 13 months on the IFN arm (P = .77). Significant toxicities occurred in the rIFN alpha-2a arm. Grade 3 or higher toxicities included malaise, fatigue, and\/or lethargy (30%), leukopenia (14%), neutropenia (13%), dyspnea (13%), nausea (11%), and respiratory infection (6%). Forty-three patients discontinued treatment due to intolerable side effects.\nrIFN alpha-2a in the dose and schedule used in this study failed to prolong response duration or survival in patients with limited-stage SCLC who had previously responded to an induction chemoradiotherapy program. Failure may have been partly related to poor tolerance and inability to complete therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a18","authors":["K Kelly","J J Crowley","P A Bunn","M B Hazuka","K Beasley","C Upchurch","G R Weiss","W J Hicks","D R Gandara","S Rivkin","P A Bunn Jr"],"doi":"10.1200\/jco.1995.13.12.2924","first_seen_on":"2017-07-26T23:39:28+00:00","issns":["0732-183X","1527-7755"],"issue":"12","journal":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","last_mentioned_on":1388534400,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/8523056","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1200\/JCO.1995.13.12.2924"],"pmid":"8523056","pubdate":"1995-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Role of recombinant interferon alfa-2a maintenance in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer responding to concurrent chemoradiation: a Southwest Oncology Group study.","type":"article","volume":"13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8398082,"mean":7.0731310424293,"rank":2155909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5096724,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8398082,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217377,"mean":12.87917955064,"rank":71470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":143991,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217377,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8945,"mean":15.295963998211,"rank":4462,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":3053,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8945,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":140,"mean":71.282244604317,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":140,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"policy":[{"title":"Management of lung cancer","url":"http:\/\/www.sign.ac.uk\/pdf\/SIGN137.pdf","license":"public","citation_ids":[3232703,26305591,21737598,26305600,619079,26305605,26305606,22627085,22537837,26305610,6038157,16020633,20283198,26305621,14584799,26305624,20472035,800213,22837986,14986929,26305636,2412928,22945794,16866209,26305639,13243226,26305642,22978116,26305647,23003112,26305650,26305651,5739444,527932,22510271,22492753,22589889,26305666,26305671,22926232,26305676,26305683,22484510,26305690,4265555,20564349,3726300,22494596,7411673,26305698,4918067,3034412,22897904,22949406,3124425,5312222,3129802,574515,23055260,22773743,22852761,22730384,847527,22473539,26305727,5363605,1428802,26305733,777326,1707687,5881560,16032020,525563,4379129,26305743,2816226,2809173,26305746,16031935,4588491,22758649,22456778,180105,9727681,22735373,2654033,23083546,23073463,26305770,22715855,1391287,811189,22675953,1559242,22858086,22999187,20564874,26305785,26305787,3588662,22550555,4479259,22748471,5582497,3588666,22470682,22769664,22530431,22627696,2968317,26305820,5739680,26305826,20565146,22452710,26305834,26305838,3124205,26305839,16850782,3441640,22553900,22776498,22998540,26305855,26305859,26305863,26305867,14563044,20565213,5818625,22414440,26305876,26305879,18346640,26305884,22846628,5752438,26305890,26305891,26305895,26305896,26305904,26305905,26305907,3844462,22897433,26305914,26305915,26305920,26305921,22759996,22745493,26305926,7591197,23080984,22571944,22771118,26305941,390896,22890500,22796332,26305951,22839057,23073769,20564733,22741589,22841807,22778295,22695571,26305965,22836726,22636348,22879906,22781424,463362,22589854,26305974,22456126,1054395,374352,6588459,26306037,26306042,902069,902064,22625523,18346259,18346236,7829445,22652348,406117,22676191,186034,20564747,17927033,26306076,26306080,26306082,26306084,7591176,5759116,22608434,7591178,26306093,26306097,26306100,22981229,3568518,22751767,22521294,16712696,22476484,902074,20564420,16850372,20564407,14598559,6087144,16696002,109757],"posted_on":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","source":{"name":"Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network","description":"The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) develops evidence based clinical practice guidelines for the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.","geo":{"country":"GB"}},"page_url":"http:\/\/www.sign.ac.uk\/guidelines\/fulltext\/137\/index.html","collections":[],"author":{"image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/cache.altmetric.com\/policy\/thumbnails\/thumbnail-2e93ac07c85e9858cd69ccc7dc74ad7b43e7fe8a6117ba0a88c6a0b60b0a53c5.jpg"}}]}}
