Phylogenetic relationships among these Mustelidae subfamilies remain argumentative subjects in recent years. One of the main reasons is that the mustelids represent a typical example of rapid evolutionary radiation and recent speciation event. Prior investigation has been concentrated on the application of different mitochondrial (mt) sequence and nuclear protein-coding data, herein we employ 17 nuclear non-coding loci (>15 kb), in conjunction with mt complete genome data (>16 kb), to clarify these enigmatic problems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b5","authors":["Li Yu","Dan Peng","Jiang Liu","Pengtao Luan","Lu Liang","Hang Lee","Muyeong Lee","Oliver A Ryder","Yaping Zhang"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2148-11-92","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T14:18:26+00:00","issns":["1471-2148",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Evolutionary Biology","last_mentioned_on":1478501582,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1471-2148-11-92","http:\/\/bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2148-11-92"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2148-11-92.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3088541","pmid":"21477367","pubdate":"2011-04-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Systematics\/Taxonomy\/Biogeography","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Entomology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Genetics and Population Dynamics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["biology"],"title":"On the phylogeny of Mustelidae subfamilies: analysis of seventeen nuclear non-coding loci and mitochondrial complete genomes","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogeny-mustelidae-subfamilies-analysis-seventeen-nuclear-noncoding-loci-mitochondrial-complete-ge"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6.45,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8448309,"mean":7.1021451727296,"rank":1359525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":7085558,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8448309,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244426,"mean":8.2239072926256,"rank":46086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":198206,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244426,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2021,"mean":9.2907722772277,"rank":584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1436,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2021,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":51,"mean":12.66412,"rank":19,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":51,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":8,"Researcher":38,"Student  > Ph.
