In this article, a classification (database) of the etiologies of epilepsy is proposed. In this scheme, the etiology of epilepsy is divided into four categories: idiopathic, symptomatic, provoked, and cryptogenic. These are defined and subcategories are proposed. A commentary addressing the following points is included: problems associated with assigning causation, symptomatic versus idiopathic epilepsy, focal versus generalized epilepsy, acquired epilepsy, acute symptomatic epilepsy, risk factor analysis, provoked epilepsy genetic and developmental epilepsy, and epilepsy as a disease not a symptom.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f4","authors":["Shorvon, Simon D."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2011.03041.x","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T14:45:28+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["1528-1167"],"journal":"Epilepsia (Series 4)","last_mentioned_on":1412473627,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2011.03041.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1528-1167.2011.03041.x\/pdf","pmid":"21449936","pubdate":"2011-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["brain","neurology"],"title":"The etiologic classification of epilepsy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/etiologic-classification-epilepsy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4330402,"mean":4.9476368122239,"rank":986476,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2776829,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4330402,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":141974,"mean":8.0200013664572,"rank":40514,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":99625,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":141974,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1755,"mean":3.3367217787913,"rank":387,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":1043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1755,"percentile":59},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.8228181818182,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":53}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":21,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":41,"Student  > Doctoral Student":31,"Student  > Ph.
