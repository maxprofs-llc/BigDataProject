Preliminary clinical models suggest that pentosan polysulfate repairs damaged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layers lining the urothelium and in vitro data suggest it may provide an anti-inflammatory effect in patients with IC. Pentosan polysulfate shows beneficial effects in a proportion of patients with IC in terms of the improvement of a patient's overall condition and the relief of pain, and it is a generally well tolerated therapy. It is the only US FDA-approved oral treatment for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with IC, and data support its role as an important option in the treatment of patients with IC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002738","authors":["Anderson VR","Perry CM"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T11:50:56+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"6","journal":"Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1239325777,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16706553"],"pmid":"16706553","pubdate":"2006-05-19T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Pentosan polysulfate: a review of its use in the relief of bladder pain or discomfort in interstitial cystitis.","type":"article","volume":"66","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pentosan-polysulfate-review-relief-bladder-pain-discomfort-interstitial-cystitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3617832,"mean":4.9276880009076,"rank":815392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2278752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3617832,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92895,"mean":7.1958875277198,"rank":23698,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68110,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92895,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":922,"mean":2.7059826275787,"rank":124,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":373,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":922,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":1.7826086956522,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
