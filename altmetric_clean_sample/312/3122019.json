A biofunctional model was tested with the null hypotheses that (1) there are no significant differences between pressures during different oral functions and (2) between pressure measurements in different oral compartments in order to substantiate various postural conditions at rest by intra-oral pressure dynamics. Atmospheric pressure monitoring was simultaneously carried out with a digital manometer in the vestibular inter-occlusal space (IOS) and at the palatal vault (sub-palatal space, SPS). Twenty subjects with normal occlusion were evaluated during the open-mouth condition (OC), gently closed lips (semi-open compartment condition, SC), with closed compartments after the generation of a negative pressure (CCN) and swallowing (SW). Pressure curve characteristics were compared between the different measurement phases (OC, SC, CCN, SW) as well as between the two compartments (IOS, SPS) using analysis of variance and Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests adopting a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05. Both null hypotheses were rejected. Average pressures (IOS, SPS) in the experimental phases were 0.0, -0.08 (OC); -0.16, -1.0 (SC); -48.79, -81.86 (CCN); and -29.25, -62.51 (SW)\u2009mbar. CCN plateau and peak characteristics significantly differed between the two compartments SPS and IOS. These results indicate the formation of two different intra-oral functional anatomical compartments which provide a deeper understanding of orofacial biofunctions and explain previous observations of negative intra-oral pressures at rest.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000256c","authors":["Wilfried Engelke","Klaus Jung","Michael Kn\u00f6sel"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00784-009-0367-0","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T13:07:53+00:00","issns":["1432-6981"],"issue":"2","journal":"Clinical Oral Investigations","last_mentioned_on":1423484129,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3056003\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3056003","pmid":"20127264","pubdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"165","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Intra-oral compartment pressures: a biofunctional model and experimental measurements under different conditions of posture","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/intraoral-compartment-pressures-biofunctional-model-experimental-measurements-under-different-condit"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4733346,"mean":5.7024597421082,"rank":1146437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2997730,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4733346,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":165803,"mean":8.6287606422121,"rank":48347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":115268,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":165803,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":316,"mean":2.1298666666667,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":256,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":316,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.7095238095238,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
