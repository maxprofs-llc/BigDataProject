Such artifacts should be easily detected and avoided. Factitious hypoglycemia, on the other hand, results from deliberate subterfuge by the patient and may thus elude proper diagnosis for some time. The most common cause of factitious hypoglycemia is surreptitious injection of insulin, and this is best diagnosed by the triad of hypoglycemia, inappropriately high insulin levels, and low C-peptide levels. Persons with diabetes may also intentionally misuse blood glucose strips to create the impression of hypoglycemia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e73cf058f6100058be","authors":["D L Horwitz"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T10:41:16+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0889-8529"],"issue":"1","journal":"Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America (Print)","last_mentioned_on":1178416033,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2645127"],"pmid":"2645127","pubdate":"1989-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","endocrinology"],"title":"Factitious and artifactual hypoglycemia.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/factitious-artifactual-hypoglycemia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629479,"mean":4.9344089205159,"rank":816456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629479,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94859,"mean":8.0713255813956,"rank":24687,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":69079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94859,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126,"mean":2.122352,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":70,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Hypoglycemia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=128548175#altmetric_citation_5","license":"public","citation_ids":[3120604],"posted_on":"2007-05-06T01:47:13+00:00","summary":"Hypoglycemia (also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglyc\u00e6mia, not to be confused with hyperglycemia) is a medical emergency that involves an abnormally diminished content of glucose in the blood.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=13315","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Alteripse","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Alteripse"}}]}}
