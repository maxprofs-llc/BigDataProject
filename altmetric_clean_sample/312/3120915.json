We suggest that neither mechanism was present in ancestral egg-laying mammals, and that both arose when the evolution of the placenta exerted selective pressure to imprint growth-related genes. We also propose that non-coding RNAs and histone modifications were adopted for the imprinting of growth suppressors on the X chromosome and on autosomes. This provides a unified hypothesis for the evolution of X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50b3cf058f61000316a","authors":["Wolf Reik","Annabelle Lewis","Reik W","Lewis A"],"doi":"10.1038\/nrg1602","endpage":"410","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T11:09:06+00:00","issns":["1471-0056","1471-0064"],"issue":"5","journal":"Nature Reviews Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1214916028,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/nrg1602","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15818385"],"pmid":"15818385","pubdate":"2005-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"403","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Co-evolution of X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting in mammals.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/nrg1602","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/coevolution-xchromosome-inactivation-imprinting-mammals"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4747406,"mean":5.7041867921572,"rank":1149915,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3008231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4747406,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":167405,"mean":8.5794003010684,"rank":48737,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":116467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":167405,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1426,"mean":10.59174877193,"rank":849,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1426,"percentile":31},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":25.821428571429,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":15,"Researcher":52,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
