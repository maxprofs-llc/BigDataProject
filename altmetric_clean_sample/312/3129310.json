Because of its sparse distribution among eukaryotic lineages and because of its diversity in regulatory mechanisms, the origin of AOX has been a mystery, particularly since no prokaryotic homologues have previously been identified. Here we report the identification of a gene encoding a clear homologue of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase in an alpha-proteobacterium, and the identification of three cyanobacterial genes that encode clear homologues of the plastid-specific alternative oxidase of plants and algae. These findings suggest that the eukaryotic nuclear genes for the alternative oxidases of mitochondria and chloroplasts were acquired via endosymbiotic gene transfer from the eubacterial ancestors of these two organelles, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Atteia A","van Lis R","van Hellemond JJ","Tielens AG","Martin W","Henze K"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gene.2004.01.015","first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T15:52:04+00:00","issns":["0378-1119"],"issue":"","journal":"Gene","last_mentioned_on":1178510569,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/15087133","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.gene.2004.01.015"],"pmid":"15087133","pubdate":"2004-04-16T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Identification of prokaryotic homologues indicates an endosymbiotic origin for the alternative oxidases of mitochondria (AOX) and chloroplasts (PTOX).","type":"article","volume":"330","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-prokaryotic-homologues-indicates-endosymbiotic-origin-alternative-oxidases-mitochondr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3927667,"mean":5.0174984198237,"rank":898982,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2490839,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3927667,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120910,"mean":8.9049790739609,"rank":35898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":83475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120910,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3686,"mean":2.1653427408412,"rank":166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":1609,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3686,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":111,"mean":1.4149636363636,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":95,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":111,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":13,"Student  > Ph.
