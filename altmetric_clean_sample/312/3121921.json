Thus, nitrous oxide may alter one-carbon and methyl-group transfer most important for DNA, purine and thymidylate synthesis. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of nitrous oxide may cause megaloblastic bone-marrow depression and neurological symptoms. Exposure to higher doses for less than 6 hours, as in clinical anaesthesia, are considered harmless. Recent studies seem to suggest a correlation between nitrous oxide anaesthesia and hyperhomocysteinaemia which is accepted to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. As for today, available data do not support the notion that exposure to trace amounts of nitrous oxide is associated with impaired fertility or an increased risk of developing cancer. Emission of nitrous oxide from medical use is estimated to contribute less than 0.05% to total annual greenhouse gas emission.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006bd4","authors":["J\u00f6rg Weimann"],"first_seen_on":"2015-01-29T12:53:37+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1521-6896"],"issue":"1","journal":"Bailliere's Best Practice & Research, Clinical Anaesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1468329411,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12751548"],"pmid":"12751548","pubdate":"2003-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Toxicity of nitrous oxide.","type":"article","volume":"17","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxicity-nitrous-oxide"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8069135,"mean":6.8476973499224,"rank":2028625,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4928723,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8069135,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241091,"mean":8.1557325314198,"rank":68538,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":166896,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241091,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":136,"mean":2.1987555555556,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":136,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.0388888888889,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
