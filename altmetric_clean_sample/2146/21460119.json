Studies that examine the nasopharynx and guttural pouches of the horse as carriage sites for MRSA have not been reported.\nMRSA colonizes the nasopharynx and guttural pouch of horses. To determine the prevalence of MRSA in equine nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) and guttural pouch lavage (GPL) samples in a field population of horses.\nOne hundred seventy-eight samples (123 NPW and 55 GPL) from 108 horses.\nProspective study. Samples were collected from a convenience population of clinically ill horses with suspected Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (S. equi) infection, horses convalescing from a known S. equi infection, and asymptomatic horses undergoing S. equi screening. Samples were submitted for S. aureus aerobic bacterial culture with mannitol salt broth and two selective agars (cefoxitin CHROMagar as the PBP2a inducer and mannitol salt agar with oxacillin). Biochemical identification of Staphylococcus species and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), to determine clonal relationships between isolates, were performed.\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) was isolated from the nasopharynx of 7\/108 (4%) horses. Three horses had MRSA (2.7%), and 4 had MR-Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). MRSA was isolated from horses on the same farm. PFGE revealed the 3 MRSA as USA 500 strains.\nSampling the nasopharynx and guttural pouch of community-based horses revealed a similarly low prevalence rate of MRSA as other studies sampling the nares of community-based horses. More study is required to determine the need for sampling multiple anatomic sites when screening horses for MRSA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004131","authors":["Boyle, A.G.","Rankin, S.C.","Duffee, L.A.","Morris, D."],"doi":"10.1111\/jvim.14783","first_seen_on":"2017-07-01T13:27:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0891-6640","1939-1676"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1498999042,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/28661019\/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.14783\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jvim.14783\/pdf","pmid":"28661019","pubdate":"2017-07-01T22:14:12+00:00","publisher":"Wiley-Blackwell","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Prevalence of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n from Equine Nasopharyngeal and Guttural Pouch Wash Samples","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/prevalence-methicillinresistant-staphylococcus-aureus-equine-nasopharyngeal-guttural-pouch-wash-samp"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4017991,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4248351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236934,"mean":12.961442179857,"rank":111352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":118439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236934,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1214,"mean":3.0066842539159,"rank":342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":832,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1214,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":2.0102941176471,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
