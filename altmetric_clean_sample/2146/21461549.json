Afterwards, to validate the performance ability of our method, we checked the TarBase v6.0, miRecords v2013, miRWalk v2.0 and miRTarBase v4.5 databases to validate predictions for miRNAs. Pathway enrichment analysis of target genes in the top 1,000 miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) interactions was conducted to focus on significant KEGG pathways. Finally, we extracted target genes based on occurrence frequency \u22653.\nBased on an absolute value of PCC >0.7, we found 33 miRNAs and 288 mRNAs for further analysis. We extracted 10 target genes with predicted frequencies not less than 3. The target gene MYO5C possessed the highest frequency, which was predicted by 7 different miRNAs. Significantly, a total of 8 pathways were identified; the pathways of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway were the most significant.\nWe successfully predicted target genes and pathways for HNSCC relying on miRNA expression data, mRNA expression profile, an ensemble method and pathway information. Our results may offer new information for the diagnosis and estimation of the prognosis of HNSCC.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61d3cf058f610007826","authors":["Gao, Hong","Jin, Hui","Li, Guijun"],"doi":"10.5301\/ijbm.5000285","first_seen_on":"2017-07-01T15:06:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0393-6155","1724-6008"],"journal":"International Journal of Biological Markers","last_mentioned_on":1498921505,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28665450?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28665450","pubdate":"2017-07-01T22:02:38+00:00","publisher":"Wichtig Publishing, SRL","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms","biochemistry"],"title":"Predicting miRNA targets for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using an ensemble method","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":7302267,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236727,"mean":12.9645518363,"rank":194189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236727,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":104,"mean":5.0882330097087,"rank":65,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":104,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/microRNA_papers\/statuses\/881166775697555457","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21461549],"posted_on":"2017-07-01T15:05:05+00:00","author":{"name":"microRNApapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/509340649733517312\/5SbSeX5X_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot for microRNA papers from PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, and PeerJ.
