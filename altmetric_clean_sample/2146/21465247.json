Although attention has focused on melanoma, several other common cutaneous malignancies, such as basal and squamous cell carcinoma, and more rare neoplasms, like Merkel cell carcinoma, need to be considered when patients present with new or changing lesions. Identification of at-risk patients, incorporation of preventive actions, early detection, and prompt treatment remain the mainstays of care for all forms of cutaneous malignancy, regardless of type.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b19","authors":["Sumul Ashok Gandhi","Jeremy Kampp"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.mcna.2015.06.002","first_seen_on":"2017-07-01T21:10:22+00:00","issns":["00257125"],"issue":"6","journal":"Medical clinics of North America","last_mentioned_on":1498959700,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26476255"],"pmid":"26476255","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Skin Cancer Epidemiology, Detection, and Management","type":"article","volume":"99","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/skin-cancer-epidemiology-detection-management-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":2174993,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5127323,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":236935,"mean":12.961418918348,"rank":79710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":154932,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":236935,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":483,"mean":3.885153526971,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":483,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1272727272727,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
