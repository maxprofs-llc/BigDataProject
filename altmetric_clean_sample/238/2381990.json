Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous disorder that may be caused by genetic or environmental factors or by a combination of both. Abnormalities in chromosomes 1, 14, and 21 have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of the early-onset form of the disease, while the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (on chromosome 19) is now recognized as a risk factor for early- and late-onset sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. 2. The best-established environmental trigger for the disease is a head injury, based on epidemiological and neuropathological evidence. Approximately 30% of patients who die after a single episode of severe head injury show intracerebral deposition of beta-amyloid protein (A beta), a protein that is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 3. Recent studies have revealed an over-representation of the apoE epsilon 4 allele in those head-injured patients displaying A beta pathology, thus providing the first evidence for a link between a genetic susceptibility (apoE epsilon 4) and an environmental trigger (head injury) in the development of Alzheimer-type pathology.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024c8","authors":["D I Graham","S M Gentleman","J A Nicoll","M C Royston","J E McKenzie","G W Roberts","R E Mrak","W S Griffin"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-27T13:38:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0272-4340"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cellular & Molecular Neurobiology","last_mentioned_on":1401197911,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10079962"],"pmid":"10079962","pubdate":"1999-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","neurology"],"title":"Is there a genetic basis for the deposition of beta-amyloid after fatal head injury?","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-basis-deposition-betaamyloid-after-fatal-head-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106325,"mean":7.7348149430046,"rank":71504,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106325,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":1.8413731343284,"rank":142,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":104,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.9375,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
