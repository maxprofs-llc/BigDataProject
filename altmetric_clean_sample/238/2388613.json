Propyl radical cyclizations compete when forming the expanded 7,8-dihydro-6H-azepino[1,2-a]indole system. 2-Thiopyridinyl S-radical is incorporated into aromatic adducts when using unsubstituted indole-1-alkanoic acid precursors. X-ray crystallography on substitution products allows selectivity of the radical addition onto less reactive internal alkynes to be determined.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Robert Coyle"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo5008543","first_seen_on":"2014-05-29T14:30:46+00:00","issns":["0022-3263"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1401373815,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo5008543?ref=tw"],"pmid":"24837130","pubdate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Tandem Reactions via Barton Esters with Intermolecular Addition and Vinyl Radical Substitution onto Indole.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tandem-reactions-via-barton-esters-intermolecular-addition-vinyl-radical-substitution-onto-indole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938630,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106072,"mean":7.7409547567198,"rank":71370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106072,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3698,"mean":2.6986080605897,"rank":2309,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1109,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3698,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73,"mean":2.1934722222222,"rank":49,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
