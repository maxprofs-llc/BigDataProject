The aim of this study was to develop a child appropriate, individually dosable, and taste masked dosage form utilizing lipids in melt granulation process and tableting. A saliva resistant coated lipid granule produced by extrusion served as reference product. Low melting hard fat was found to be appropriate as lipid binder in high-shear granulation. The resulting granules were compressed to minitablets without addition of other excipients. Compression to 2mm minitablets decreased the dissolved API amount within the first 2 min of dissolution from 33% to 23%. The Euclidean distances, calculated from electronic tongue measurements, were reduced, indicating an improved taste. The reference product showed a lag time in dissolution, which is desirable for taste masking. Although a lag time was not achieved for the lipidic minitablets, drug release in various food materials was reduced to 2%, assuming a suitable taste masking for oral sodium benzoate administration.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284d","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejpb.2014.05.013","first_seen_on":"2014-05-28T07:31:58+00:00","issns":["09396411"],"journal":"European Journal of Pharmaceutics & Biopharmaceutics","last_mentioned_on":1404389564,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0939641114001623"],"pmid":"24859305","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Lean production of taste improved lipidic sodium benzoate formulations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/lean-production-taste-improved-lipidic-sodium-benzoate-formulations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507778,"mean":5.1527747520697,"rank":1978724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2425302,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507778,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106209,"mean":7.7667516382949,"rank":42371,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":60760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106209,"percentile":57},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":1.2972268370607,"rank":67,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":234,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.825,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
