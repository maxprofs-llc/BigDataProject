The aim of this paper is to update the knowledge about pleural effusions, rather than to review the causes of pleural diseases exhaustively. These recommendations have a longer extension for the subjects with a direct clinical usefulness, but a slight update of other pleural diseases has been also included. Among the main scientific advantages are included the thoracic ultrasonography, the intrapleural fibrinolytics, the pleurodesis agents, or the new pleural drainages techniques.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60c3cf058f610006b06","doi":"10.1016\/j.arbres.2014.01.016","first_seen_on":"2014-05-27T13:52:48+00:00","issns":["03002896"],"journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumologia","last_mentioned_on":1401749450,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0300289614000672"],"pmid":"24698396","publisher":"SEPAR","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Normativa sobre el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento del derrame pleural.
