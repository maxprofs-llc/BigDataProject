Standard histology and scanning electron microscopy show that HES grow and expand according to the complex structure dictated by the scaffold. We further show that the expression levels of NPHS-1, REN, AQP-1, SLC2A2, and ANPEP were 7.6-, 5.1-, 128-, 4.3-, and 3.9-fold higher, respectively, when the HES were grown on KMS compared with the HES grown on collagen. Similarly, the levels of these genes were 10-, 30-, 4.6-, 7.5-, and 3-fold higher, respectively, when the HES were grown on KMS compared with the HES grown on Matrigel. We have also shown that culturing HES in 5% kidney-derived serum-free conditioned media can lead to the upregulation of NPHS-1, REN, and EPO by 3-, 18-, and 15-fold, respectively. This article demonstrates a novel way of growing HES in vitro whereby the beneficial biophysical as well as biochemical surroundings of the seeded cells provide a more in vivo-like environment, thereby assisting in differentiation of the HES toward a renal lineage. The approach presented here may provide a powerful tool for in vitro study of HES differentiation toward kidney-specific cell lineages under controlled conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b99","authors":["FinesilverGershon"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tec.2013.0574","first_seen_on":"2014-05-28T08:23:37+00:00","issns":["1937-3384"],"journal":"Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods","last_mentioned_on":1401265383,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1089\/ten.TEC.2013.0574"],"pmid":"24846632","pubdate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Kidney-Specific Microscaffolds and Kidney-Derived Serum-Free Conditioned Media Support In Vitro Expansion, Differentiation, and Organization of Human Embryonic Stem Cells.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kidneyspecific-microscaffolds-kidneyderived-serumfree-conditioned-media-support-iin-vitroi-expansion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3568888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":138271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106199,"mean":7.7321957663988,"rank":82123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106199,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":155,"mean":5.2076363636364,"rank":111,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":155,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":1.1454545454545,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/StemCellsDave\/status\/471567313268146176","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2384581],"posted_on":"2014-05-28T08:23:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Stem Cells Dave","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444034674281562113\/AsmUeTKB_normal.jpeg","description":"Tweeting about research on stem cells, developmental biology, regenerative medicine, biomaterials and computational biology.
