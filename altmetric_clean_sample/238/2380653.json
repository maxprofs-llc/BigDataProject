Current approaches require sequential labeling, low pH, and typically days to reach completion, limiting their utility. We report the efficient, genetically encoded incorporation of alkyne- and cyclopropene-containing amino acids at distinct sites in a protein using an optimized orthogonal translation system in E. coli. and quantitative, site-specific, one-pot, concerted protein labeling with fluorophores bearing azide and tetrazine groups, respectively. Protein double labeling in aqueous buffer at physiological pH, temperature, and pressure is quantitative in 30 min.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Amit Sachdeva","Kaihang Wang","Thomas Elliott","Jason W.
