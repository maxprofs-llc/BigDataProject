Various side-effects have been associated with the use of methadone. These include xerostomia, which can contribute to a high caries rate. The UK Regional Drug Misuse Database reported that around 118,500 drug users were receiving treatment from drug misuse agencies and GPs. The vast majority (87%) were receiving treatment from community specialist services. As many drug abusers have poor oral health, general dental practitioners are likely to encounter such individuals. It is essential therefore that dentists are aware of the potential difficulties that may be encountered when treating subjects receiving methadone. These problems may relate to previous drug abuse and to the effects of methadone therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f33","authors":["Graham CH","Meechan JG"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-27T15:08:46+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"8","journal":"Dental Update","last_mentioned_on":1401199200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16262036"],"pmid":"16262036","pubdate":"2005-11-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Dental management of patients taking methadone.","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dental-management-patients-taking-methadone-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4808539,"mean":5.7513002704793,"rank":883458,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3902967,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4808539,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115363,"mean":8.0222365943726,"rank":23988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":90921,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115363,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":58,"mean":1.4219298245614,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":53,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":58,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Is there a relationship between sugar-containing methadone and dental caries?
