These methods are unable to define 1) the instantaneous changes in coordination within the stride cycle, 2) coordination between multiple joints, or 3) the coupling strength of joint rotations rather than their phase relationships. The present paper introduces a new method called generalized wavelet coherence analysis (GWCA) that solves these three fundamental limitations of previous methods. GWCA combines wavelet coherence analysis with a matrix correlation method to define instantaneous correlation coefficients as the coupling strength for an arbitrary number of joint rotations. The main purpose of the present study is to develop GWCA to quantify inter-joint coordination and thereby assess age-related differences in the coordination of human gaits. Nine young and 19 healthy older persons walked 5 minutes on a treadmill at 3 different gait speeds. Joint rotations of the lower extremities were assessed by a Vicon three-dimensional motion capture system. The main results indicated that the older group had significant weaker correlations (t-tests: p < 0.0001) in the pre-swing phase compared with the younger group for all gait speeds. The age-related differences in inter-joint coordination were more pronounced than the age-related differences in rotations of the individual joints. The intra-stride changes in inter-joint coordination were in agreement with recent findings of intra-stride modulations in neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, change in the inter-joint coordination assessed by GWCA might be an early indicator of functional decline.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007b71","authors":["Espen Alexander F\u00fcrst Ihlen"],"doi":"10.1152\/japplphysiol.00212.2014","first_seen_on":"2014-05-28T08:25:03+00:00","issns":["1522-1601"],"journal":"Journal of Applied Physiology","last_mentioned_on":1401265484,"links":["http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/20\/japplphysiol.00212.2014.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jap.physiology.org\/content\/early\/2014\/05\/20\/japplphysiol.00212.2014.full.pdf","pmid":"24855139","publisher":"American Physiological Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Age-related changes inter-joint coordination during walking","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/agerelated-changes-interjoint-coordination-during-walking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":3059027,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":938661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":106200,"mean":7.732132374128,"rank":71449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":24076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":106200,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2609,"mean":7.294268404908,"rank":2058,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":385,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2609,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":14.522769230769,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":12,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":12}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
