Autophagy is closely related to many life activities, and especially, its dysfunctions might cause many diseases and physiological problems, such as tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration and microbial infection. In recent years, many studies found that epigenetic modifications may regulate the occurrence of autophagy and also play an important role in the process of autophgy biological function.However the exact mechanism of epigenetic modifications remains largely unknown. Here,we review the epigenetic effects on regulation of autophagy process, including histone acetylation activation and negatively feedback controlling autophagy, DNA methylation regulating cell autophagy process by changing autophagy related genes, and miRNA regulating autophagy related gene expression by targeted degradation and histone modifications. This review will help understand the relationship between epigenetic effects and autophagy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa92f3cf058f61000de8c","authors":["Yuanchao S","Xunsi Q","Hong C","Wei S"],"first_seen_on":"2014-05-28T08:53:27+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"5","journal":"Yi chuan Hereditas","last_mentioned_on":1401267196,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24846994?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"24846994","pubdate":"2014-05-24T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Epigenetic control of autophagy.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigenetic-control-autophagy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3818068,"mean":5.0266051776132,"rank":3061644,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71313,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3818068,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94893,"mean":7.4749686591072,"rank":75575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":246,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94893,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.0162280701754,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":0.94166666666667,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/epigen_papers\/status\/471574918526541824","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[2384642],"posted_on":"2014-05-28T08:53:16+00:00","author":{"name":"epigenetics_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epigenetics","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/471205704921931776\/wSQqKYz8_normal.jpeg","description":"Chromatin & epigenetics paper feed from #Pubmed and #Arxiv - hear it here first!
