The author considers how the events that occurred in Nicole Taus's case might have affected those clients with whom she wrote case studies. Finally, the author analyzes the potential losses to the field should other participants in case studies be at risk of the kind of intrusive invasion of privacy experienced by Taus and calls for the development of ethical principles for psychological science.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4db3cf058f6100017f5","authors":["Laura S Brown"],"doi":"10.1177\/0886260514534992","first_seen_on":"2014-05-28T21:43:29+00:00","issns":["1552-6518"],"journal":"Journal of Interpersonal Violence","last_mentioned_on":1401294180,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24860072"],"pmid":"24860072","pubdate":"2014-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Criminology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["socialsciences"],"title":"First Do No Harm: Is It Any Longer Safe to Write Case Reports?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/first-harm-it-longer-safe-write-case-reports"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.176,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.176},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3818136,"mean":5.0265079422579,"rank":610125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":3207059,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3818136,"percentile":83},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94893,"mean":7.4743239683009,"rank":17695,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":77148,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94893,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":764,"mean":4.1601520314548,"rank":139,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":623,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":764,"percentile":81},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":7.7511428571429,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
