However, only two-chain HGF stimulates Met signaling. Proteolytic cleavage of the Arg(494)-Val(495) peptide bond in the zymogen-like pro-HGF results in allosteric activation of the serine protease-like \u03b2-chain (HGF \u03b2), which binds Met to initiate signaling. We use insights from the canonical trypsin-like serine protease activation mechanism to show that isolated peptides corresponding to the first 7-10 residues of the cleaved N terminus of the \u03b2-chain stimulate Met phosphorylation by pro-HGF to levels that are \u223c25% of those stimulated by two-chain HGF. Biolayer interferometry data demonstrate that peptide VVNGIPTR (peptide V8) allosterically enhances pro-HGF \u03b2 binding to Met, resulting in a K(D)(app) of 1.6 \u03bcm, only 8-fold weaker than the Met\/HGF \u03b2-chain affinity. Most notably, in vitro cell stimulation with peptide V8 in the presence of pro-HGF leads to Akt phosphorylation, enhances cell survival, and facilitates cell migration between 75 and 100% of that found with two-chain HGF, thus revealing a novel approach for activation of Met signaling that bypasses proteolytic processing of pro-HGF. Peptide V8 is unable to enhance Met binding or signaling with HGF proteins having a mutated activation pocket (D672N). Furthermore, Gly substitution of the N-terminal Val residue in peptide V8 results in loss of all activity. Overall, these findings identify the activation pocket of the serine protease-like \u03b2-chain as a \"hot spot\" for allosteric regulation of pro-HGF and have broad implications for developing selective allosteric activators of serine proteases and pseudoproteases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cc7","authors":["Kyle E.
