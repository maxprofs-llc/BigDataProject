Surface topography is one of the most important factors that regulates cell behaviors. In the present study, micro\/nano topographical structures composed of a gold nanoparticle layer (GNPL) with nano-, sub-micro-, and microscale surface roughnesses were used to study the roles of these structures in regulating the behaviors of mouse ESCs (mESCs) under feeder-free conditions. The distinctive results from Oct-4 immunofluorescence staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) demonstrate that nanoscale and low sub-microscale surface roughnesses (Rq less than 392 nm) are conducive to the long-term maintenance of mESC pluripotency, while high sub-microscale and microscale surface roughnesses (Rq greater than 573 nm) result in a significant loss of mESC pluripotency and a faster undirectional differentiation, particularly in long-term culture. Moreover, the likely signalling cascades engaged in the topological sensing of mESCs were investigated and their role in affecting the maintenance of the long-term cell pluripotency was discussed by analyzing the expression of proteins related to E-cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesions and integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs). Additionally, the conclusions from MTT, cell morphology staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays show that the surface roughness can provide a potent regulatory signal for various mESC behaviors, including cell attachment, proliferation and osteoinduction.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["Zhonglin Lyu","Hongwei Wang","Yanyun Wang","Kaiguo Ding","Huan Liu","Lin Yuan","Xiujuan Shi","Mengmeng Wang","Yanwei Wang","Hong Chen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c4nr01540a","first_seen_on":"2014-05-27T16:16:23+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["2040-3372","2040-3364"],"issue":"12","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1401785569,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2014\/nr\/c4nr01540a"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2014\/nr\/c4nr01540a","pmid":"24839204","pubdate":"2014-05-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"6959","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Maintaining the pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells on gold nanoparticle layers with nanoscale but not microscale surface roughness","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/maintaining-pluripotency-mouse-embryonic-stem-cells-gold-nanoparticle-layers-nanoscale-not-microscal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6335023,"mean":5.9768461059805,"rank":4681445,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":943070,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6335023,"percentile":14},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144176,"mean":7.664872176175,"rank":95364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":26983,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144176,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1828,"mean":4.1972731253421,"rank":1033,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":501,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1828,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75,"mean":4.7872972972973,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
