It serves as an adaptor that binds both dynein and cargoes and enhances single motor processivity. The dynactin subunit, dynamitin (also known as p50), is thought to be integral to dynactin structure because free dynamitin displaces the dynein-binding p150(Glued) subunit from the cargo-binding Arp1 filament. We show here that the intrinsically disordered dynamitin N-terminus binds to Arp1 directly. When expressed in cells, dynamitin AA 1-87 causes complete release of endogenous dynamitin, p150 and p24 from dynactin, leaving behind Arp1 filaments carrying the remaining dynactin subunits (actin capping protein, p62, Arp11, p27 and p25). TAP-tagged dynamitin AA 1-87 binds the Arp filament specifically, and binding studies with purified native Arp1 reveal that this fragment binds Arp1 directly. Neither capping protein nor the p27\/p25 dimer contribute to interactions between dynamitin and the Arp filament. This work demonstrates for the first time that Arp1 can directly bind any protein besides another Arp, and provides important new insight into the underpinnings of dynactin structure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067c7","authors":["Frances Ka Yan Cheong","Lijuan Feng","Ali Sarkeshik","John R.
