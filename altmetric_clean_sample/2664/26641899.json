In fact, studies have demonstrated phase-amplitude coupling of distinct oscillatory rhythms during cognitive processes. Here we investigated whether olfacto-hippocampal coupling occurs when mice are detecting familiar odors located in a spatially restricted area of a new context. The spatial olfactory task (SOT) was designed to expose mice to a new environment in which only one quadrant (target) contains odors provided by its own home-cage bedding. As predicted, mice showed a significant higher exploration preference to the target quadrant; which was impaired by olfactory epithelium lesion (ZnSO4). Furthermore, mice were able to discriminate odors from a different cage and avoided the quadrant with predator odor (TMT), reinforcing the specificity of the SOT. The local field potential (LFP) analysis of non-lesioned mice revealed higher gamma activity (35-100Hz) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and a significant theta phase\/gamma amplitude coupling between MOB and dorsal hippocampus, only during exploration of home-cage odors (i.e. in the target quadrant). Our results suggest that exploration of familiar odors in a new context involves dynamic coupling between the olfactory bulb and dorsal hippocampus.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031aa","authors":["Roberta Ribas Pena","Daniel de Castro Medeiros","Leonardo de Oliveira Guarnieri","Julio Boriollo Guerra","Vin\u00edcius Rezende Carvalho","Eduardo Mazoni Andrade Mar\u00e7al Mendes","Grace Schenatto Pereira","M\u00e1rcio Fl\u00e1vio Dutra Moraes"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neuroscience.2017.08.058","first_seen_on":"2017-09-27T11:42:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["03064522"],"journal":"Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1506882432,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/authShare\/S0306452217306346\/20170923T215900Z\/1?md5=4ccfc4afba5f82f2f82ff300bbba1a02","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0306452217306346?_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_origin=gateway&_docanchor=&md5=b8429449ccfc9c30159a5f9aeaa92ffb"],"pmid":"28890054","pubdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Home-cage odors spatial cues elicit theta phase\/gamma amplitude coupling between olfactory bulb and dorsal hippocampus","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/homecage-odors-spatial-cues-elicit-theta-phasegamma-amplitude-coupling-between-olfactory-bulb-dorsal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":1.75,"6m":1.75,"3m":1.75,"1m":1.75,"1w":1.75,"6d":1.75,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462593,"mean":7.1086032149407,"rank":3901558,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4475920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462593,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":114261,"mean":11.499848013303,"rank":47305,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":65071,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":114261,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3529,"mean":4.1143469387755,"rank":1604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":1874,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3529,"percentile":53},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":55,"mean":1.912037037037,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":37,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":55,"percentile":67}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
