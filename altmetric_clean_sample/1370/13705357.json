Ethane dehydrogenation, catalyzed by thermally stable Irn (n = 8, 12, 18) atomic clusters that exhibit a cuboid structure, was studied using the B3LYP method with triple-\u03b6 basis sets. Relativistic effects and dispersion corrections were included in the calculations. In the dehydrogenation reaction Irn + C2H6 \u2192 H-Irn-C2H5 \u2192 (H)2-Irn-C2H4, the first H-elimination is the rate-limiting step, primarily because the reaction releases sufficient heat to facilitate the second H-elimination. The catalytic activity of the Ir clusters strongly depends on the Ir cluster size and the specific catalytic site. Cubic Ir8 is the least reactive toward H-elimination in ethane: Ir8 + C2H6 \u2192 H-Ir8-C2H5 has a large (65 kJ\/mol) energy barrier, whereas Ir12 (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 cuboid) and Ir18 (3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 cuboid) lower this energy barrier to 22 and 3 kJ\/mol, respectively. The site dependence is as prominent as the size effect. For example, the energy barrier for the Ir18 + C2H6 \u2192 H-Ir18-C2H5 reaction is 3, 48, and 71 kJ\/mol at the corner, edge, or face-center sites of the Ir18 cuboid, respectively. Energy release due to Ir cluster insertion into an ethane C-H bond facilitates hydrogen migration on the Ir cluster surface, and the second H-elimination of ethane. In an oxygen-rich environment, oxygen molecules may be absorbed on the Ir cluster surface. The oxygen atoms bonded to the Ir cluster surface may slightly increase the energy barrier for H-elimination in ethane. However, the adsorption of oxygen and its reaction with H atoms on the Ir cluster releases sufficient heat to yield an overall thermodynamically favored reaction: Irn + C2H6 + (1)\/2O2 \u2192 Irn + C2H4 + H2O. These results will be useful toward reducing the energy cost of ethane dehydrogenation in industry.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002ec4","authors":["Yingbin Ge"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b09882","first_seen_on":"2016-11-16T20:48:27+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1089-5639","1520-5215"],"issue":"47","journal":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","last_mentioned_on":1479329294,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.jpca.6b09882"],"pmid":"27934327","pubdate":"2016-11-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Theoretical And Computational Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear, Particle And Plasma Physics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
