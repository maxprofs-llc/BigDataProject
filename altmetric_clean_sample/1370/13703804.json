Output variables included yield and particle diameters at the 50(th) and 90(th) percentile (D50, D90). Following data analysis, the optimized conditions were identified and tested to produce IBU particles with a minimum size and an acceptable yield. Finally, indomethacin (IND) was milled using the optimized conditions as well as the control.\nCCC design included eight successful runs for milling IBU from the ten total runs due to powder \"blowback\" from the feed hopper. DoE analysis allowed the optimization of the GrindP and PushP at 75 and 65\u2009psi. In subsequent validation experiments using the optimized conditions, the experimental D50 and D90 values (1.9 and 3.6 \u03bcm) corresponded closely with the DoE modeling predicted values. Additionally, the optimized conditions were superior over the control conditions for the micronization of IND where smaller D50 and D90 values (1.2 and 2.7 \u03bcm vs. 1.8 and 4.4 \u03bcm) were produced.\nThe optimization of a single-step air-jet milling of IBU using the DoE approach elucidated the optimal milling conditions, which were used to micronize IND using the optimized milling conditions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5613cf058f61000494d","authors":["Ashkan K.
