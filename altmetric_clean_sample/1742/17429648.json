No study to date has used a person-centered approach to determine whether there are subgroups of attempters showing differing patterns of psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to identify psychiatric subgroups amongst recent suicide attempters (i.e., hospitalized within 24h of their attempt) and to determine whether identified classes could be differentiated in terms of important clinical correlates. Participants included 97 adult patients who were hospitalized due to a recent suicide attempt at a large Trauma 1 hospital. A structured diagnostic interview assessed a range of psychiatric disorders, and a battery of measures assessed acute and distal clinical correlates and characteristics of the current attempt. The person-centered analytic approach of latent class analysis was used to identify psychiatric diagnostic subgroups, or classes, of attempters. Three psychiatric subgroups were identified: Major Depressive Disorder, High Externalizing Disorders, and High Internalizing High Externalizing Disorders. Classes were found to significantly differ on a range of acute and distal clinical correlates, but not by demographics. Identification of psychiatric subgroups of individuals who have recently attempted suicide has important practical implications for increasing subsequent treatment utilization and tailoring treatment interventions for this population.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Meredith K.
