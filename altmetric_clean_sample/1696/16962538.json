This pilot study sought to assess whether diabetic socks with mild compression (18-25 mm Hg) can reduce LE edema in patients with diabetes without negatively impacting vascularity.\nEighteen subjects (9 males, 9 females) aged 61 \u00b1 11 years with diabetes, LE edema, and a mean ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 1.10 \u00b1 0.21 successfully completed this uncontrolled study. At baseline, subjects were fitted and instructed to wear the socks during all waking hours. Follow-up visits occurred weekly for four consecutive weeks. Edema was quantified through midfoot, ankle, and calf circumferences and cutaneous fluid measurements. Vascular status was tracked via ABI.\nRepeated measures analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc analyses were used for data analyses. Calf circumferences showed a statistically significant (p < .05) decrease of 1.3 \u00b1 0.28 cm after just one week and remained significantly smaller than baseline throughout the study. Foot circumferences were significantly reduced at week 2 (-0.98 \u00b1 0.35 cm) and remained significantly below baseline for the remainder of the study. The ankle also demonstrated a trend of circumference reduction but was not statistically significant. Cutaneous edema significantly reduced by week 3 (-3.1 \u00b1 1.3 U) and remained so at week 4. Ankle-brachial index significantly increased (0.14 \u00b1 0.049) at week 2 but was not significantly higher at weeks 3 or 4. No adverse events occurred during the study.\nMild compression therapy (18-25 mm Hg) decreased swelling in diabetes patients with LE edema without compromising vascularity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c3b","authors":["Stephanie C Wu","Ryan T Crews","Bijan Najafi","Nancy Slone-Rivera","Jessica L Minder","Charles A Andersen"],"doi":"10.1177\/193229681200600319","first_seen_on":"2017-03-03T20:40:34+00:00","issns":["1932-2968"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Diabetes Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1488576907,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3440039\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3440039","pmid":"22768895","pubdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Diabetes Technology Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"641","subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Safety and Efficacy of Mild Compression (18-25 mm Hg) Therapy in Patients with Diabetes and Lower Extremity Edema","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dst.sagepub.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1177\/193229681200600319","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/safety-efficacy-mild-compression-1825-mm-hg-therapy-patients-diabetes-lower-extremity-edema"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.25,"score_history":{"1y":4.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":1780892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":6508230,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241719,"mean":13.72830935222,"rank":73519,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":167897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241719,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":537,"mean":8.3998544776119,"rank":132,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":537,"percentile":75},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.0571428571429,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Master":7,"Other":3,"Student  > Bachelor":5,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Design":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":12,"Social Sciences":1,"Sports and Recreations":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Nursing and Health Professions":7,"Unspecified":2,"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":3},"mendeley":{"US":1,"DK":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GLawrenceBScDch\/statuses\/837764600321949696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16962538],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T20:40:20+00:00","author":{"name":"GLawrenceBScDch","url":"http:\/\/georgetownfootclinic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3434921445\/ab58bb0bc917872f5bcbe93f11f481b0_normal.jpeg","description":"We want all our patients to be informed decision makers and fully understand any health issues you face.","id_on_source":"GLawrenceBScDch","tweeter_id":"1305605288","geo":{"lt":30.63269,"ln":-97.67723,"country":"US"},"followers":17},"tweet_id":"837764600321949696"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/footdocgreg\/statuses\/837764600955293696","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16962538],"posted_on":"2017-03-03T20:40:20+00:00","author":{"name":"Greg Lawrence","url":"http:\/\/www.georgetownfootclinic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1757349617\/image_normal.jpg","description":"Chiropodist\/Foot Specialist.
