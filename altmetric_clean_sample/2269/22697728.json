To this end, unmodified polymers chitosan and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) backbone was covalently modified by thioglycolic acid (TGA) and cysteine, respectively. The thiolated buccoadhesive film was evaluated in terms of thickness, weight uniformity, water-uptake capacity, drug content, and release patterns. Moreover, mucoadhesion profile was investigated on buccal mucosa. The resulting chitosan-TGA and NaCMC-cysteine conjugates displayed 171\u2009\u00b1\u200913 and 380\u2009\u00b1\u200919\u00a0\u03bcmol thiol groups per gram of polymer (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD; n\u2009=\u20093), respectively. The water binding capacity of the thiolated film was significantly \u223c2-fold higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) as compared to unmodified film. The obtained thiolated film displayed 5.8-fold higher mucoadhesive properties compared with corresponding film. Controlled release of drugs from film was observed over 8\u00a0h. The transport of fluconazole across excised buccal mucosa was enhanced up to 17-fold in comparison with fluconazole applied in buffer. Based on these findings, thiolated film seems to be promising for fluconazole buccal delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6063cf058f6100067ed","authors":["Kiran Naz","Gul Shahnaz","Naveed Ahmed","Naveeda Akhtar Qureshi","Hafiz Shoaib Sarwar","Muhammad Imran","Gul Majid Khan"],"doi":"10.1208\/s12249-016-0607-y","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T11:35:20+00:00","issns":["1530-9932"],"journal":"AAPS PharmSciTech","last_mentioned_on":1501286846,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1208\/s12249-016-0607-y"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1208%2Fs12249-016-0607-y.pdf","pmid":"27511112","pubdate":"2016-08-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"Formulation and In Vitro Characterization of Thiolated Buccoadhesive Film of Fluconazole","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/formulation-vitro-characterization-thiolated-buccoadhesive-film-fluconazole"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":4170806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3907274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174722,"mean":11.638332942234,"rank":86590,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":80415,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174722,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":390,"mean":3.5332082262211,"rank":183,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":390,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
