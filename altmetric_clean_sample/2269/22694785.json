This work demonstrates that the subsurface of pentacene remains highly accessible, even to large adsorbates, and that three distinct reaction regimes (surface, subsurface, and bulk) are accessed within a narrow thermal range 30-75 \u00baC. Progression of this transition is quantitatively measured via polarized modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure the thin-film morphology. Together they reveal the close relationship between extent of reaction and the morphology changes. Finally, the reaction kinetics of the pentacene thin-film are measured with a series of adsorbates that have different reactivity and diffusivity in the thin-film. The results suggest that reaction kinetics in the thin-film is controlled by both the reactivity and the adsorbates diffusivity in the thin-film lattice, which is very different than the traditional solution kinetics that is dominated by the chemical activation barriers. Combined, these experiments guide efforts towards rationally functionalizing the surfaces of organic semiconductors to enable the next generation of flexible devices.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fd3","authors":["Deye, Gregory J.","Vicente, Juvinch R.","Dalke, Shawn M.","Piranej, Selma","Chen, Jixin","Ciszek, Jacob W."],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.7b02099","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T11:16:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["0743-7463","1520-5827"],"journal":"Langmuir","last_mentioned_on":1501154168,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28745890?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28745890","pubdate":"2017-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society (ACS)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physics and Astronomy","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"The Role of Thermal Activation and Molecular Structure on the Reaction of Molecular Surfaces","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-thermal-activation-molecular-structure-reaction-molecular-surfaces"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"mean":6.9841686085689,"rank":6284112,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1120213,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8282830,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171712,"mean":11.607422820903,"rank":121057,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171712,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2867,"mean":2.8548583391486,"rank":1627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2867,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":1.0017857142857,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
