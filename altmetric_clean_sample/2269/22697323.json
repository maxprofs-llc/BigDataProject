However, we found that these dot-like HHs are occasionally seen in some patients without clinical symptoms of TGA.\nWe identified 8 patients who did not show clinical symptoms of TGA, despite the presence of hippocampal lesions on DWI (No-TGA group, n=8). For the comparison group, 16 age-matched and sex-matched patients were selected from among patients who had been diagnosed with TGA (TGA group, n=16).\nNo significant difference was found in vascular risk factors, years of education, or underlying cognitive function between the 2 groups. More than half of the patients in each group performed preceding Valsalva-associated activities. Multiple hippocampal lesions or concomitant lesions in the cingulate gyrus were found only in the TGA group.\nDot-like HHs on DWI can be observed without the typical symptoms of TGA. Valsalva maneuver-associated activities could produce asymptomatic hippocampal lesions. The symptoms of TGA may be presented on a spectrum, from no symptoms to mild vegetative symptoms or to the typical symptoms of TGA, depending on individual susceptibility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f61000829f","authors":["Jeong, Moonyoung","Jin, Jaehyun","Kim, Jeong Hee","Moon, Yeonsil","Choi, Jin Woo","Kim, Hahn Young"],"doi":"10.1097\/nrl.0000000000000123","first_seen_on":"2017-07-27T11:32:44+00:00","issns":["1074-7931"],"issue":"4","journal":"The Neurologist","last_mentioned_on":1501759867,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/theneurologist\/Abstract\/2017\/07000\/Incidental_Hippocampal_Hyperintensity_on.1.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/theneurologist\/2017\/07000\/Incidental_Hippocampal_Hyperintensity_on.1.pdf","pmid":"28644249","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"103","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Incidental Hippocampal Hyperintensity on Diffusion-weighted MRI","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/theneurologist\/Fulltext\/2017\/07000\/Incidental_Hippocampal_Hyperintensity_on.1.aspx","volume":"22"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":1.85,"6m":1.85,"3m":1.85,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8317445,"mean":7.0084957256017,"rank":3728354,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4497123,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8317445,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":188621,"mean":11.981341713498,"rank":78365,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":107253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":188621,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202,"mean":3.2658805970149,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":128,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9178571428571,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neurologistlww\/statuses\/890535033592627200","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22697323],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T11:31:12+00:00","author":{"name":"The Neurologist","url":"http:\/\/www.theneurologist.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1484931278\/neurologist_normal.jpg","description":"The Neurologist publishes articles on topics of current interest to physicians treating patients with neurological diseases.","id_on_source":"neurologistlww","tweeter_id":"339076573","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":254},"tweet_id":"890535033592627200"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrFelipeSuarez\/statuses\/890536337715146752","license":"gnip","rt":["neurologistlww"],"citation_ids":[22697323],"posted_on":"2017-07-27T11:36:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Felipe Su\u00e1rez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/733838861990821888\/uTv4gO-7_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"DrFelipeSuarez","tweeter_id":"3942369442","geo":{"lt":-40.57395,"ln":-73.13348,"country":"CL"},"followers":32},"tweet_id":"890536337715146752"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/neurologistlww\/statuses\/893071729068654592","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[22697323],"posted_on":"2017-08-03T11:31:07+00:00","author":{"name":"The Neurologist","url":"http:\/\/www.theneurologist.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1484931278\/neurologist_normal.jpg","description":"The Neurologist publishes articles on topics of current interest to physicians treating patients with neurological diseases.","id_on_source":"neurologistlww","tweeter_id":"339076573","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":254},"tweet_id":"893071729068654592"}]}}
