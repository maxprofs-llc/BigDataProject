Concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) transmission, due to frequent natural or anthropogenic environmental changes that facilitate contact between wildlife, humans and their pets. The municipality of Campinas, in southeastern Brazil, initially recorded VL in 2009, when the first autochthonous case was confirmed in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium, located inside an environmentally protected area (EPA). Since then, disease transmission remains restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study of the VL focus to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals and sand flies using molecular tools and recommended serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified. Two specimens of the main L. (L.) infantum vector in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, were captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was also detected in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of each sampling of infected animals were plotted on a map of the EPA, demonstrating proximity between these animals, human residences, including the dogs positive for VL, and forest areas.\nThe EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e. wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident. Moreover, different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included to elaborate prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e2","authors":["Maria Rita Donalisio","La\u00eds Moraes Paiz","Vanessa Gusmon da Silva","Virg\u00ednia Bodel\u00e3o Richini-Pereira","Andrea Paula Bruno von Zuben","Claudio Luiz Castagna","Gabriela Motoie","Roberto Mitsuyoshi Hiramoto","Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Tolezano"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005666","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T18:08:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1935-2735"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1502065320,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005666"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosntds\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pntd.0005666&type=printable","pmid":"28704391","pubdate":"2017-07-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"e0005666","title":"Visceral leishmaniasis in an environmentally protected area in southeastern Brazil: Epidemiological and laboratory cross-sectional investigation of phlebotomine fauna, wild hosts and canine cases","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/visceral-leishmaniasis-environmentally-protected-area-southeastern-brazil-epidemiological-laboratory"},"altmetric_score":{"score":51.95,"score_history":{"1y":51.95,"6m":51.95,"3m":51.95,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":51.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8336644,"mean":7.0294968595789,"rank":179330,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":8157285,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8336644,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":223457,"mean":12.510582414435,"rank":10531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":212923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":223457,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4505,"mean":11.122198490231,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":4311,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4505,"percentile":95},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":194,"mean":14.320704663212,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":194,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":4,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
