We examined student and faculty perceptions of a research internship embedded in an existing evidence-based practice course. Students (n = 15) and faculty (n = 5) viewed the internship as a positive experience that provided meaningful hands-on skills while generating interest in a potential research career. The internship also provided faculty the opportunity to identify potential doctoral students.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b84","authors":["O\u2019Brien, Tara","Hathaway, Donna"],"doi":"10.1097\/nne.0000000000000412","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T18:00:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0363-3624"],"journal":"Nurse Educator","last_mentioned_on":1503466991,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nurseeducatoronline\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Students_and_Faculty_Perceptions_of_an.99711.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nurseeducatoronline\/9000\/00000\/Students_and_Faculty_Perceptions_of_an.99711.pdf","pmid":"28665823","pubdate":"2017-06-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","education"],"title":"Students and Faculty Perceptions of an Undergraduate Nursing Research Internship Program","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nurseeducatoronline\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/Students_and_Faculty_Perceptions_of_an.99711.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/students-faculty-perceptions-undergraduate-nursing-research-internship-program"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":3965063,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4419887,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229946,"mean":12.915636182565,"rank":106223,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":121958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229946,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":715,"mean":1.4606246498599,"rank":197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":715,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":19,"mean":1.4583333333333,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":19,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"FR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Photos from Nurse Educator's post","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1405872916158264&id=137004639711771","license":"public","citation_ids":[21854929],"posted_on":"2017-07-11T13:00:01+00:00","summary":"Do internship programs really work?
