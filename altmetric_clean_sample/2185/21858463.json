The primary endpoint was 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR).\nThe median follow-up duration was 730\u00a0days. The 2-year MACE rates were significantly higher in the low HDL-C group than in the normal HDL-C group (MACE, 7.44% vs. 3.49%, p\u2009=\u20090.006; cardiac death, 3.72% vs. 0.97%, p\u2009=\u20090.004; non-fatal MI, 1.75% vs. 1.55%, p\u2009=\u20090.806; TVR, 3.50% vs. 0.97%, p\u2009=\u20090.007). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the low HDL-C group had a significantly higher incidence of MACE compared to the normal HDL-C group (log-rank p\u2009=\u20090.013). After adjusting for conventional risk factors, Cox proportional hazards analysis suggested that low HDL-C was an independent risk predictor for MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 3.075, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.034-9.144, p\u2009=\u20090.043).\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, low HDL-C remained an independent risk predictor for MACE after adjusting for multiple risk factors during 2-year follow-up of AMI.\nThis study was the sub-analysis of the prospective multi-center registry of DIAMOND (Diabetic acute myocardial infarction Disease) in Korea. This is the observational study supported by Bayer HealthCare, Korea. Study number is 15614. First patient first visit was 02 April 2010 and last patient last visit was 09 December 2013.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000086a","authors":["Hyung Joon Joo","Sang-A Cho","Soon Jun Hong","Seung-Ho Hur","Jang-Ho Bae","Dong-Ju Choi","Young-Keun Ahn","Jong-Seon Park","Rak-Kyeong Choi","Donghoon Choi","Joon-Hong Kim","Kyoo-Rok Han","Hun-Sik Park","So-Yeon Choi","Jung-Han Yoon","Hyeon-Cheol Kwon","Seung-Woon Rha","Kyung-Kuk Hwang","Kyung-Tae Jung","Seok-Kyu Oh","Jae-Hwan Lee","Eun-Seok Shin","Kee-Sik Kim","Hyo-Soo Kim","Do-Sun Lim"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12944-016-0374-5","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T21:29:15+00:00","issns":["1476-511X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Lipids in Health and Disease","last_mentioned_on":1499981342,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27863493"],"pmid":"27863493","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Lipidology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["metabolism","biochemistry"],"title":"Impact of low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level on 2-year clinical outcomes after acute myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes mellitus","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-low-highdensity-lipoproteincholesterol-level-2year-clinical-outcomes-after-acute-myocardial-i-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":7099905,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179357,"mean":11.444934655099,"rank":146301,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179357,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":692,"mean":5.0010477568741,"rank":579,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":692,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":2.616,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"NZ":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MikkiWilliden\/statuses\/885612053800431616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[21858463],"posted_on":"2017-07-13T21:29:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Mikki Williden","url":"http:\/\/mikkiwilliden.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/774796848489869312\/JmxPpow6_normal.jpg","description":"PhD, Registered nutritionist, Auckland NZ; Fitter Radio cohost; avid runner & advocate of whole food & great coffee.","id_on_source":"MikkiWilliden","tweeter_id":"143685143","geo":{"lt":-36.85,"ln":174.78333,"country":"NZ"},"followers":1850},"tweet_id":"885612053800431616"}]}}
