One hundred and ninety-nine women completed an online survey measuring levels of appearance-based comparisons, body surveillance, thin ideal internalization, body esteem, and fat talk (FT-body concerns and FT-body comparisons). Results showed that fat talk made a significant contribution in explaining additional variance in body esteem above the other three body image factors, with FT-body concerns in particular making the highest unique contribution. Hierarchical regression analyses suggest that fat talk should be viewed as an independent psychosocial predictor of body esteem in both theoretical and therapeutic contexts. Future research should explore these relationships from a longitudinal perspective, and also clarify the nuances in the relationships by investigating the nature of women's everyday body image experiences.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fe3cf058f610006120","authors":["Jacqueline Mills","Matthew Fuller-Tyszkiewicz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.bodyim.2016.05.001","first_seen_on":"2017-07-13T16:24:29+00:00","issns":["17401445"],"journal":"Body Image","last_mentioned_on":1499963148,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1740144515301169"],"pmid":"27286565","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Studies In Human Society","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychology"],"title":"Fat talk and its relationship with body image disturbance","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fat-talk-relationship-body-image-disturbance-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":10,"6m":10,"3m":10,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8204513,"mean":6.9458687178401,"rank":829244,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":7340923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8204513,"percentile":89},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":179355,"mean":11.445087647892,"rank":26973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":151890,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":179355,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":10.956585365854,"rank":88,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":77},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":8.0076923076923,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":78}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
