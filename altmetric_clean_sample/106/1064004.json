This classical A-T phenotype is caused by biallelic null mutations in the ATM gene, leading to the absence of ATM protein and increased cellular radiosensitivity. We report an unusual case of A-T in a 41-year-old mother, A-T210, who had very mild neurological symptoms despite complete loss of ATM protein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ecf","doi":"10.1002\/mds.25236","first_seen_on":"2012-11-13T11:29:14+00:00","funders":["cruk"],"issns":["1531-8257"],"journal":"Movement Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1352806146,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23143971?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23143971","pubdate":"2012-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Very mild presentation in adult with classical cellular phenotype of ataxia telangiectasia.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/very-mild-presentation-adult-classical-cellular-phenotype-ataxia-telangiectasia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3071948,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":949116,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80141,"mean":5.4287314699277,"rank":51646,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16043,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80141,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1566,"mean":3.001392971246,"rank":1194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":222,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1566,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.72222222222222,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
