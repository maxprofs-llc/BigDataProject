Preliminary results showed that the clone library constructed from the initial operation condition was characterized by 31 taxa of bacteria belonging to eight phyla including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Sphingobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobiae, and Actinobacteria. There were 14 taxa of bacteria belonging to four phyla including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetacia, and Nitrospirae from the stable operation condition where the water quality was well maintained. Nitrospirae was only found under the stable operation condition in this study. Our results further indicated that Nitrospira was dominated by members of the Nitrospira sp. lineages, with a minor fraction related to Nitrospira moscoviensis and an unknown Nitrospira cluster. These great differences of both diversity and composition between two operation conditions suggested that the composition of the microbial community varied with the degree of water quality in the recirculating aquaculture system of S.\u00a0barcoo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000da6","authors":["Peng Zhu","Yangfang Ye","Fangfang Pei","Kaihong Lu"],"doi":"10.1139\/w11-130","endpage":"310","first_seen_on":"2012-11-11T23:08:24+00:00","issns":["0008-4166","1480-3275"],"journal":"Canadian Journal of Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1329584671,"links":["http:\/\/www.nrcresearchpress.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1139\/w11-130"],"pmid":"22339297","pubdate":"2012-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"303","title":"Characterizing the structural diversity of a bacterial community associated with filter materials in recirculating aquaculture systems of","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterizing-structural-diversity-bacterial-community-associated-filter-materials-recirculating-aq"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3615908,"mean":4.932414788326,"rank":2902619,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":70953,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3615908,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77024,"mean":5.1345749451462,"rank":57601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":181,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77024,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":420,"mean":1.9744725536993,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":420,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":0.27604166666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
