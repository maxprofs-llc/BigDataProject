Annealing experiments combined with Raman and transmission electron microscopy studies show that this aggressive reaction causes formation of MoS(2) and secondary phases at the CZTS|Mo interface during thermal processing. A reaction scheme is presented and discussed in the context of current state-of-the-art synthesis methods for CZTS(e). It is concluded that alternative back contacts will be important for future improvements in CZTS(e) quality.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Jonathan J.
