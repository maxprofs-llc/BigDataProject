PM"],"citation":{"abstract":"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERBB2 (HER2) pathways and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis have a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis and progression. Robust experimental evidence has shown that these pathways are functionally linked and implicated in acquired resistance to targeted therapies making them attractive candidates for joined targeting. We undertook this phase I trial to assess the safety, the recommended dose for phase II trials (RPTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and the preliminary antitumour activity of the combination of lapatinib and sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid tumours.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008e9a","doi":"10.1016\/j.ejca.2012.10.016","first_seen_on":"2012-11-14T11:01:02+00:00","issns":["1879-0852"],"journal":"European Journal of Cancer (1965)","last_mentioned_on":1352890850,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23146956?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23146956","pubdate":"2012-11-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of lapatinib in combination with sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phase-i-pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-study-lapatinib-combination-sorafenib-patients-advanced-refr-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":4204187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83037,"mean":5.6937623922155,"rank":68175,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83037,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1375,"mean":3.1794774381368,"rank":1181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1375,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":2.7886808510638,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/268669817060474881","license":"public","citation_ids":[1066146],"posted_on":"2012-11-14T11:00:50+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"268669817060474881"}]}}
