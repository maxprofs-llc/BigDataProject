Recently, a gamma camera system, based on cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) technology, was introduced. This technique has the potential to reduce the effective dose and scan time compared to the conventional NaI gamma camera. The aim of this study was to investigate if the effective dose can be reduced with a preserved image quality using CZT technology in MPS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007da1","doi":"10.1007\/s12350-012-9634-6","first_seen_on":"2012-11-13T23:46:09+00:00","issns":["1532-6551"],"journal":"Journal of Nuclear Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1352880105,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23143809?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23143809","pubdate":"2012-11-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Reduced administered activity, reduced acquisition time, and preserved image quality for the new CZT camera.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/reduced-administered-activity-reduced-acquisition-time-preserved-image-quality-new-czt-camera"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632299,"mean":4.9243828402896,"rank":2740323,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":734151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632299,"percentile":20},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76664,"mean":5.1056232863311,"rank":51843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":19643,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76664,"percentile":25},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":1.0274559193955,"rank":186,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":0.79347826086957,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":8}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
