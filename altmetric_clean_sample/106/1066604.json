Against this background, we developed a secure internet platform (ALShome.de) that allows online assessment of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and other established self-assessment questionnaires. We developed a secure and closed internet portal to assess patient reported outcomes. In a prospective, controlled and stratified study, patients conducted a web-based self-assessment of ALSFRS-R compared to on-site assessment. On-site and online assessments were compared at baseline (n = 127) and after 3.5 months (n = 81, 64%). Results showed that correlation between on-site evaluation and online testing of ALSFRS-R was highly significant (r = 0.96; p < 0.001). The agreement of both capturing methods (online vs. on-site) was excellent (mean interval, 8.8 days). The adherence to online rating was high; 75% of patients tested on-site completed a follow-up online visit (mean 3.5 months, SD 1.7). We conclude that online self-assessment of ALS severity complements the well-established face-to-face application of the ALSFRS-R during on-site visits. The results of our study support the use of online administration of ALSFRS-R within clinical trials and for managing the care of ALS patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa51a3cf058f6100038a4","authors":[" Andr\u00e9  Maier "],"doi":"10.3109\/17482968.2011.633268","first_seen_on":"2012-11-14T14:29:11+00:00","issns":["1748-2968"],"issue":"2","journal":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis","last_mentioned_on":1352228268,"links":["http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/17482968.2011.633268#.UJldpDZh-fo.facebook","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/full\/10.3109\/17482968.2011.633268","http:\/\/informahealthcare.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/17482968.2011.633268"],"pmid":"22292842","pubdate":"2012-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Informa Healthcare Stockholm","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Online assessment of ALS functional rating scale compares well to in-clinic evaluation: A prospective trial","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/online-assessment-als-functional-rating-scale-compares-inclinic-evaluation-prospective-trial"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710546,"mean":5.7127347510756,"rank":1761211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2932590,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710546,"percentile":62},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81081,"mean":5.6575017266897,"rank":23256,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":57440,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81081,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":109,"mean":4.8429444444444,"rank":60,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":109,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":3.7974285714286,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":37}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
