People with severe NMDs like DMD are now living much longer, well in to adulthood. This makes them suitable for the medical model of palliative care. Yet palliative medicine is a new area, especially for \"adults\" with DMD. Strategies for identifying the most effective modalities to alleviate suffering in patients with an NMD receiving palliative services and creating best practice standards in pain and symptom management for this patient population are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c2c","authors":["Carter GT","Joyce NC","Abresch AL","Smith AE","Vandekeift
