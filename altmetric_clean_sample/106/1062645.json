While hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytoglobin, and neuroglobin are present in almost all gnathostomes examined so far, other globin genes, like globin X, are much more restricted in their phyletic distribution. Till today, globin X has only been found in teleost fish and Xenopus. Here, we report that globin X is also present in the genomes of the sea lamprey, ghost shark and reptiles. Moreover, the identification of orthologs of globin X in crustacean, insects, platyhelminthes, and hemichordates confirms its ancient origin.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e5","doi":"10.1186\/1745-6150-6-54","first_seen_on":"2012-11-12T18:35:55+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"1","journal":"Biology Direct","last_mentioned_on":1319834024,"links":["http:\/\/www.biology-direct.com\/content\/6\/1\/54\/abstract","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/1745-6150-6-54"],"pmid":"22004552","pubdate":"2011-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"54","title":"Phylogenetic analysis reveals wide distribution of globin X","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/phylogenetic-analysis-reveals-wide-distribution-globin-x"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630009,"mean":4.9312762825916,"rank":1807630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1645515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630009,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77085,"mean":5.1095523844118,"rank":31636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":40640,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77085,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":428,"mean":4.403943793911,"rank":170,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":244,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":428,"percentile":57},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":6.4128421052632,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
