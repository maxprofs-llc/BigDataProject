Infections are strongly associated with IBD both in their etiopathogenesis and in their clinical course. A number of viral infections, tuberculosis and other therapy-related infections create challenges for the successful management of intestinal disease with immunosuppressive agents or TNF antagonists. Recently published guidelines offer a strong support to deal with these issues. Major concern about IBD patients with malignancies is related to the consequences of chemotherapy on the intestinal disease, the risk of maintaining immunosuppressant or anti-TNF therapy after the diagnosis of malignancy and the management of a clinical relapse of IBD in patients with a recent diagnosis of malignancy. Further research is required to optimize strategies for IBD patients with malignancies. At the moment, all therapeutic choice is made on an individual basis, with an integrative multidisciplinary approach.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000712f","authors":["Kohn A","Meddi P"],"doi":"10.1159\/000338145","first_seen_on":"2012-11-15T05:00:21+00:00","issns":["0257-2753"],"issue":"4","journal":"Digestive Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1352955618,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22796809"],"pmid":"22796809","pubdate":"2012-07-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"How to Manage IBD in Patients with Infections or Malignancies?.","type":"article","volume":"30","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/manage-ibd-patients-infections-malignancies"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2925952,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":1433899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":31},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79733,"mean":5.4148818040436,"rank":48281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":28248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79733,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":222,"mean":1.8793303167421,"rank":122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":222,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.7125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":6,"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"DE":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"How to manage IBD in patients with infections or mal...
