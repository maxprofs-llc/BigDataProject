As our previous study revealed that ginseng reduces adipose tissue mass in part by decreasing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in obese mice, we hypothesized that adipogenesis can be inhibited by ginseng and its active components ginsenosides (GSs). Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with Korean red ginseng extract (GE) inhibited lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (PPAR\u03b3, C\/EBP\u03b1, aP2, and leptin). GE decreased both the mRNA levels and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 3T3-L1 cells. These effects were further inhibited by total GSs (TGSs) and individual GSs. TGSs and individual GSs also significantly decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 reporter gene activities in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), the MMP inducer. Among the GSs, Rb1 most effectively inhibited MMP activity. In addition, PMA treatment attenuated the inhibitory actions of GE and GSs on adipogenesis. Moreover, GE and GSs reduced the expression of NF-\u03baB and AP-1, the transcription factors of MMP-2 and MMP-9. These results demonstrate that ginseng, in particular GSs, effectively inhibits adipogenesis and that this process may be mediated in part through the suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Thus, ginseng and GSs likely have therapeutic potential for controlling adipogenesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Yoon, Michung"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/265023","first_seen_on":"2012-11-14T17:56:34+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1352915958,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2012\/265023\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/ecam\/2012\/265023.pdf","pmid":"23258984","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Ginseng and Its Active Components Ginsenosides Inhibit Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Cells by Regulating MMP-2 and MMP-9","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ginseng-active-components-ginsenosides-inhibit-adipogenesis-3t3l1-cells-regulating-mmp2-mmp9"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5028713,"mean":5.9653160399705,"rank":2152965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":2871899,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5028713,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83060,"mean":5.6821549260165,"rank":29379,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":53582,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83060,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3218,"mean":3.7646459434255,"rank":983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":2233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3218,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":4.44,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":11,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":52}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
