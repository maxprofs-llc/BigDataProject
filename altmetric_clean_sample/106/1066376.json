This phenomenon is called \"short-term synaptic plasticity\" and is shown at all synapses. While much work has been done to understand the mechanisms of short-term changes in the state of synapses, short-term plasticity is often thought of as a mechanistic consequence of the design of a synapse. This review will attempt to go beyond this view and discuss how, on one hand, complex neuronal activity affects the short-term state of synapses, but also how these dynamic changes in synaptic strength affect information processing in return.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e79","authors":["Achim Klug","J.
