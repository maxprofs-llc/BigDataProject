Complexes 1Pr-7Dy were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and their core [Mn(2)(III)Mn(2)(II)Ln(2)(III)(\u03bc(3)-OR)(4)(\u03bc(2)-OR)(6)](6+) composed of four face-sharing defected cubane units. Antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions were suggested for all of the complexes by solid-state dc magnetic susceptibility measurements. Complexes 6Tb and 7Dy, show frequency-dependent ac susceptibility signals suggestive of slow magnetic relaxation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Jin-Ying Liu","Cheng-Bing Ma","Hui Chen","Ming-Qiang Hu","Hui-Min Wen","Hong-Hua Cui","Xiao-Wei Song","Chengneng Chen","Jinying Liu","Chengbing Ma","Mingqiang Hu","Huimin Wen","Honghua Cui","Xiaowei Song","Changneng Chen"],"doi":"10.1039\/c2dt32269b","endpage":"2430","first_seen_on":"2012-11-13T19:27:35+00:00","issns":["1477-9234","1477-9226"],"issue":"7","journal":"Dalton Transactions: An International Journal of Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1352834852,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/Content\/ArticleLanding\/2012\/DT\/C2DT32269B"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2012\/dt\/c2dt32269b","pmid":"23208662","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2423","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Syntheses, Structures and Magnetic Properties of a Family of Heterometallic [MnII2MnIII2LnIII2] Clusters","type":"article","volume":"42","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/syntheses-structures-magnetic-properties-family-heterometallic-mn-supiisup-sub2sub-mn-supiiisup-sub2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3545211,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136061,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80140,"mean":5.3877237549757,"rank":62168,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":621,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80140,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7985,"mean":1.0186788577154,"rank":5344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":22,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":1.25,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/InorganicNews\/statuses\/268434943850471424","license":"public","citation_ids":[1065028],"posted_on":"2012-11-13T19:27:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Inorganic News","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1636129253\/DSC01061_2_normal.JPG","description":"News, comments and publications about Inorganic Chemistry.","id_on_source":"InorganicNews","tweeter_id":"411132501","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1288},"tweet_id":"268434943850471424"}]}}
