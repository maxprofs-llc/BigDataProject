Currently there are many unresolved questions concerning the relationship between apoptosis and the generation of ROS. These include which ROS are involved in apoptosis, what mechanisms and targets are important and whether apoptosis is triggered by ROS damage or ROS are generated as a consequence or part of the cellular disruption that occurs during cell death. Here we review the nature of the ROS involved, the damage they cause to cells, summarise the responses of S. cerevisiae to ROS and discuss those aspects in which ROS affect cell integrity that may be relevant to the apoptotic process.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c38","authors":["Perrone GG","Tan SX","Dawes IW","Gabriel G.
