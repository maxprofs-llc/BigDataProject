There is a need for robust evidence on outcomes after surgery, but there are a number of measures that assess function after joint replacement, many of which lack any clear theoretical basis. The World Health Organisation has introduced the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), which divides function into three separate domains: Impairment, activity limitations and participation restrictions. The aim of this study is to compare the properties and responsiveness of a selection of commonly used outcome tools that assess function, examine how well they relate to the ICF concepts, and to explore the changes in the measures over time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Vikki Wylde","Ashley W Blom","Stijn Bolink","Luke Brunton","Paul Dieppe","Rachael Gooberman-Hill","Bernd Grimm","Cindy Mann","Erik Lenguerrand","Wylde V","Blom AW","Bolink S","Brunton L","Dieppe P","Gooberman-Hill R","Grimm B","Mann C","Lenguerrand E"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2474-13-220","first_seen_on":"2012-11-14T15:32:49+00:00","funders":["dohuk"],"issns":["","1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1353904732,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/13\/220\/abstract"],"pmid":"23148591","pubdate":"2012-11-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Orthopedics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rehabilitation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Rheumatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Sports Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"220","subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Assessing function in patients undergoing joint replacement: a study protocol for a cohort study","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/assessing-function-patients-undergoing-joint-replacement-study-protocol-cohort-study-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3636264,"mean":4.9211313967159,"rank":1809490,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":1648853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3636264,"percentile":45},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76435,"mean":5.1027947771934,"rank":31344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":40289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76435,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1374,"mean":3.4174872541879,"rank":718,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1374,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80,"mean":2.3582278481013,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
