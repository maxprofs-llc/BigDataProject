Histopathology and serological tests revealed a syphilitic aortitis. F-FDG PET\/CT was performed to assess the extent of aortitis, showing increased radiopharmaceutical uptake along the ascending aortic wall. A repeated FDG PET\/CT after antibiotic therapy showed a markedly reduced uptake in the aortic wall, suggesting resolution of the infection according to clinical and serological data. This case highlights the usefulness of FDG PET\/CT for the assessment of disease extent and treatment response in patients with syphilitic aortitis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006f10","doi":"10.1097\/rlu.0b013e3182638e65","first_seen_on":"2012-11-14T05:49:09+00:00","issns":["1536-0229"],"journal":"Clinical Nuclear Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1352872354,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23143047?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23143047","pubdate":"2012-11-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"Usefulness of 18F-FDG PET\/CT in Disease Extent and Treatment Response Assessment in a Patient With Syphilitic Aortitis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/usefulness-18ffdg-petct-disease-extent-treatment-response-assessment-patient-syphilitic-aortitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.95,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2164388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":2868712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":56},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83049,"mean":5.6952501444948,"rank":29526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":53424,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83049,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1986,"mean":0.86937128463476,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":1840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1986,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":49,"mean":1.0395833333333,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":49,"percentile":87}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"IT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/268591347802460160","license":"public","citation_ids":[1065882],"posted_on":"2012-11-14T05:49:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24804},"tweet_id":"268591347802460160"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/_newsaggregator\/statuses\/268591574701703168","license":"datasift","rt":["usmolecular"],"citation_ids":[1065882],"posted_on":"2012-11-14T05:49:56+00:00","author":{"name":"News Aggregator","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3259264116\/9a718a9720af795519391ccad6d18cc8_normal.jpeg","description":"Working on several novellas,politico,grassroots leader,govt advisr @politico_news @news_aggregate","id_on_source":"_newsaggregator","tweeter_id":"22265452","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2256},"tweet_id":"268591574701703168"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Giodda\/statuses\/268592237846360064","license":"datasift","rt":["usmolecular"],"citation_ids":[1065882],"posted_on":"2012-11-14T05:52:34+00:00","author":{"name":"Giovanna Maddalena","url":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/u\/0\/101987306375702195422\/posts","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/894225543452864515\/beNQUwwS_normal.jpg","description":"Dio ride. \nEd essendosi sconsideratamente eletti come suo popolo, gli ebrei non possono che ridere di se stessi.","id_on_source":"Giodda","tweeter_id":"325052983","geo":{"lt":45.43861,"ln":12.32667,"country":"IT"},"followers":140},"tweet_id":"268592237846360064"}]}}
