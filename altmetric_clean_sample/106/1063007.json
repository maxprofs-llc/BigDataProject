Here, we show that haploinsufficiency of Nkx2-1 in combination with oncogenic Kras(G12D), but not with oncogenic EGFR(L858R), caused pulmonary tumors in transgenic mice that were phenotypically similar to human mucinous adenocarcinomas. Gene expression patterns distinguished tumor goblet (mucous) cells from nontumorigenic airway and intestinal goblet cells. Expression of NKX2-1 inhibited urethane and oncogenic Kras(G12D)-induced tumorigenesis in vivo. Haploinsufficiency of Nkx2-1 enhanced Kras(G12D)-mediated tumor progression, but reduced EGFR(L858R)-mediated progression. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression demonstrated that a set of genes induced in mucinous tumors was shared with genes induced in a nontumorigenic chronic lung disease, while a distinct subset of genes was specific to mucinous tumors. ChIP with massively parallel DNA sequencing identified a direct association of NKX2-1 with the genes induced in mucinous tumors. NKX2-1 associated with the AP-1 binding element as well as the canonical NKX2-1 binding element. NKX2-1 inhibited both AP-1 activity and tumor colony formation in vitro. These data demonstrate that NKX2-1 functions in a context-dependent manner in lung tumorigenesis and inhibits Kras(G12D)-driven mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cff","authors":["Yutaka Maeda","Tomoshi Tsuchiya","Haiping Hao","David H.
