We previously reported that fac-Ir(atpy)(3)4 (atpy = 2-(5'-amino-4'-tolyl)pyridine) containing three amino groups at the 5'-position of the atpy ligand shows a maximum red emission (at around 600 nm) under neutral and basic conditions and a green emission (at 531 nm) at acidic pH (pH 3-4). In this Article, we report on the design and synthesis of a new pH-sensitive cyclometalated Ir(III) complex containing a 2-(5'-N,N-diethylamino-4'-tolyl)pyridine (deatpy) ligand, fac-Ir(deatpy)(3)5. The complex exhibits a considerable change in emission intensity between neutral and slightly acidic pH (pH 6.5-7.4). Luminescence microscopic studies using HeLa-S3 cells indicate that 5 can be used to selectively stain lysosome, an acidic organelle in cells. Moreover, complex 5 is capable of generating singlet oxygen in a pH-dependent manner and inducing the death of HeLa-S3 cells upon photoirradiation at 377 or 470 nm.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Shinsuke Moromizato","Yosuke Hisamatsu","Toshihiro Suzuki","Yasuki Matsuo","Ryo Abe","Shin Aoki"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic301310q","first_seen_on":"2012-11-12T20:26:43+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1354477791,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic301310q"],"pmid":"23145911","pubdate":"2012-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"121112092335009","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Design and Synthesis of a Luminescent Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complex Having\n              \n              ,\n              \n              -Diethylamino Group that Stains Acidic Intracellular Organelles and Induces Cell Death by Photoirradiation\n            ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-luminescent-cyclometalated-iridiumiii-complex-having-n-n-diethylamino-group-stains"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":1989347,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":2419605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80584,"mean":5.4195229018528,"rank":30906,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":47229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80584,"percentile":58},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.4086585528509,"rank":1604,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":4304,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":353,"mean":0.77767045454545,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":353,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
