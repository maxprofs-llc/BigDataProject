A case of a 57-year-old patient with CCSVI in whom the venous outflow from the left IJV to the right atrium occurred through a venous anomaly, the persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC), is reported. PLSVC is caused by persistence of the left anterior cardinal vein that drains blood from the limb effluent from the left and the left side of head and neck into coronary sinus (Type a), or in the left atrium (Type b). PLSVC can be associated either with innominate vein hypoplasia or other congenital heart abnormalities. Because of evidence of left innominate vein hypoplasia, angioplasty was not performed using the ordinary route but passing with the balloon directly through the PLSVC up to the left IJV. Finally, angioplasty was carried out in a standard manner in the right IJV as well as in the azygous vein. Confirmation angiogram revealed complete reopening of all treated vessels with no evidence of peri- and postoperative complications. The patient was discharged home the following day in good general conditions. PLSVC is a rare congenital vein anomaly but in case of concomitant innominate vein hypoplasia may prove to be a valuable alternative to treat patients with IJV diseases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043cd","authors":["G Bellagamba"],"doi":"10.1258\/phleb.2012.012040","first_seen_on":"2012-11-15T14:33:58+00:00","issns":["1758-1125"],"journal":"Phlebology","last_mentioned_on":1355943741,"links":["http:\/\/phleb.rsmjournals.com\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/09\/phleb.2012.012040.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/phleb.rsmjournals.com\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/09\/phleb.2012.012040.full.pdf","pmid":"23155131","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and persistent left superior vena cava","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/percutaneous-transluminal-angioplasty-patient-chronic-cerebrospinal-venous-insufficiency-persistent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3622323,"mean":4.9314823624217,"rank":1403772,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":2193321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3622323,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76194,"mean":5.1217746512146,"rank":21187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":54427,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76194,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":2.7837790697674,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1,"FR":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency a","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=117339175093172&id=117471578700","citation_ids":[1068733],"posted_on":"2012-11-15T14:17:43+00:00","summary":"via Sandro Rasman - Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and persistent left superior vena cava http:\/\/phleb.rsmjournals.com\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/09\/phleb.2012.012040.abstract","author":{"name":"Ven\u00f6se Multiple Sklerose, CVI & SVI, CCSVI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/117471578700","facebook_wall_name":"Ven\u00f6se Multiple Sklerose, CVI & SVI, CCSVI","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/117471578700\/picture","id_on_source":"117471578700"}},{"title":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency a","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=191414570983258&id=182832983940","citation_ids":[1068733],"posted_on":"2012-11-15T13:29:52+00:00","summary":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and persistent left superior vena cava\n\nhttp:\/\/phleb.rsmjournals.com\/content\/early\/2012\/11\/09\/phleb.2012.012040.abstract?maxtoshow=&hits=3&RESULTFORMAT=&ando","author":{"name":"CCSVI at UBC MS Clinic - Information and Support","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/182832983940","facebook_wall_name":"CCSVI at UBC MS Clinic - Information and Support","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/182832983940\/picture","id_on_source":"182832983940"}},{"title":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in a patient with chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency a","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=368580146569989&id=182832983940","citation_ids":[1068733],"posted_on":"2012-11-16T18:14:04+00:00","summary":"Case study of patient with CCSVI and congenital anomaly in left superior vena cava (vein taking blood directly to the right chamber of the heart from the left side of the body).
