We describe a process for identifying a three-level hierarchy of spatial scales for Michigan rivers. Additionally, we conduct a variance decomposition of fish occurrence, abundance, and assemblage metric data to evaluate how much observed variability can be explained by the three spatial scales as a gage of their utility for water resources and fisheries management. The process involved the development of geographic information system programs, statistical models, modification by experienced biologists, and simplification to meet the needs of policy makers. Altogether, 28,889 reaches, 6,198 multiple-reach segments, and 11 segment classes were identified from Michigan river networks. The segment scale explained the greatest amount of variation in fish abundance and occurrence, followed by segment class, and reach. Segment scale also explained the greatest amount of variation in 13 of the 19 analyzed fish assemblage metrics, with segment class explaining the greatest amount of variation in the other six fish metrics. Segments appear to be a useful spatial scale\/unit for measuring and synthesizing information for managing rivers and streams. Additionally, segment classes provide a useful typology for summarizing the numerous segments into a few categories. Reaches are the foundation for the identification of segments and segment classes and thus are integral elements of the overall spatial scale hierarchy despite reaches not explaining significant variation in fish assemblage data.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000652d","authors":["Paul Seelbach"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00267-012-9938-y","first_seen_on":"2012-11-13T17:20:06+00:00","issns":["1432-1009"],"journal":"Environmental Management","last_mentioned_on":1352827202,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/h416864k0h568280\/fulltext.pdf"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00267-012-9938-y","pmid":"22961585","pubdate":"2012-09-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Forestry Management","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nature Conservation","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Delineation and Validation of River Network Spatial Scales for Water Resources and Fisheries Management","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/delineation-validation-river-network-spatial-scales-water-resources-fisheries-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074070,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952103,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80142,"mean":5.4213048252456,"rank":51775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80142,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":477,"mean":2.8484117647059,"rank":332,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":477,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":4.0407692307692,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
