The mt genomes of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes important human pathogens such as the malaria parasite Plasmodium, also show marked diversity of structure. Plasmodium has a concatenated linear mt genome of the smallest size (6-kb); Babesia and Theileria have a linear monomeric mt genome (6.5-kb to 8.2-kb) with terminal inverted repeats; Eimeria, which is distantly related to Plasmodium and Babesia\/Theileria, possesses a mt genome (6.2-kb) with a concatemeric form similar to that of Plasmodium; Cryptosporidium, the earliest branching lineage within the phylum Apicomplexa, has no mt genome. We are interested in the evolutionary origin of linear mt genomes of Babesia\/Theileria, and have investigated mt genome structures in members of archaeopiroplasmid, a lineage branched off earlier from Babesia\/Theileria.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007b9","authors":["Kenji Hikosaka","Kenji Hikosaka","Naotoshi Tsuji","Yoh-ichi Watanabe","Hiroe Kishine","Toshihiro Horii","Ikuo Igarashi","Kiyoshi Kita","Kazuyuki Tanabe"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2164-13-622","first_seen_on":"2012-11-15T01:28:21+00:00","issns":["","1471-2164"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Genomics","last_mentioned_on":1352934303,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/13\/622\/abstract"],"pmid":"23151128","pubdate":"2012-11-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Life Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microarrays","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Microbial Genetics and Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Genetics & Genomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proteomics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"622","subjects":["genetics"],"title":"Novel type of linear mitochondrial genomes with dual flip-flop inversion system in apicomplexan parasites, Babesia microti and Babesia rodhaini","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-type-linear-mitochondrial-genomes-dual-flipflop-inversion-system-apicomplexan-parasites-babesi"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3074031,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":952034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79732,"mean":5.4141250705498,"rank":51507,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16467,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79732,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4113,"mean":3.3618876459144,"rank":3075,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":600,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4113,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172,"mean":2.8469824561404,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
