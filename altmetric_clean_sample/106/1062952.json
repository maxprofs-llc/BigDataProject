This process, providing one of the simplest methods for the synthesis of this class of valuable lactones, involves two steps including cyclization reaction and simple acid hydrolysis. The methodology is tolerant of a wide range of substrates and applicable to library synthesis.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e9f","authors":["Xiang-Dong Fei"],"doi":"10.1021\/jo302004u","first_seen_on":"2012-11-12T21:50:53+00:00","issns":["0022-3263"],"journal":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1352757030,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/jo302004u"],"pmid":"23101723","pubdate":"2012-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Palladium-Catalyzed Synthesis of Isocoumarins and Phthalides via tert-Butyl Isocyanide Insertion","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/palladiumcatalyzed-synthesis-isocoumarins-phthalides-via-tert-butyl-isocyanide-insertion"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964817,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":80582,"mean":5.3770028666807,"rank":52682,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18395,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":80582,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3698,"mean":2.6862867189613,"rank":2320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":1192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3698,"percentile":32},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":2.8843428571429,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":23,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
