The main objective of present work was to check the feasibility of plant based viz. mango gum polymeric nanoparticles as a carrier for central nervous system (CNS) delivery using model drug donepezil (DZP). The nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by Modified ionic gelation method and Emulsion cross linking method. Zeta sizer results showed that the diameter of NPs was about 90 - 130nm. The polymeric DZP loaded NPs were almost spherical in shape, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). On increasing concentration of NPs suspension from 50\u03bcg\/ml to 5000\u03bcg\/ml there was no significant increase in % hemolysis. In-vivo studies showed that brain targeting was achieved. So on the basis of above results, the extracted water soluble fraction of mango gum is a suitable candidate for brain delivery in the form of nano-formulations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5233cf058f610003ba9","authors":["Jakki, Satya Lavanya","Ramesh Yasam, Venkata","Gowthamarajan, K","Senthil, V","Jain, Kunal","Sood, Sumeet","Pathak, Deepa"],"doi":"10.1080\/10717544.2016.1196767","endpage":"28","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T23:15:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1521-0464","1071-7544"],"journal":"Drug Delivery","last_mentioned_on":1464995686,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27246872"],"pmid":"27246872","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["pharmacology","drugtherapy"],"title":"Novel Anionic Polymer as a Carrier for CNS Delivery of Anti-Alzheimer Drug","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-anionic-polymer-carrier-cns-delivery-antialzheimer-drug"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":1086181,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":6692963,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269242,"mean":11.37573267073,"rank":53623,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":211949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269242,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":0.98374407582938,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":96,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":96},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.29,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
