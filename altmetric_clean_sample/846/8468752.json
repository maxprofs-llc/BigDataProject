A previous study showed that prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) plays a role in rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation. Based on the inverse relationship between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation, we investigated whether PHD is involved in the effects of rosiglitazone on osteoblast differentiation. Rosiglitazone inhibited osteoblast differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner, and in parallel induced three PHD isoforms (PHD1, 2, and 3). PHD inhibitors and knockdown of each isoform prevented the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone on osteoblast differentiation and increased the expression of Runx2, a transcription factor essential for osteoblastogenesis. MG-132, a proteasomal inhibitor also prevented the rosiglitazone-induced degradation of Runx2. Furthermore, both increased PHD isoform expressions and reduced osteoblast differentiation by rosiglitazone were prevented by PPAR\u03b3 antagonists, indicating these effects were mediated via PPAR\u03b3 activation. In vivo oral administration of rosiglitazone to female ICR mice for 8 weeks reduced bone mineral densities and plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and increased PHD expression in femoral primary bone marrow cells and the ubiquitination of Runx2. Together, this suggests that the rosiglitazone-induced suppression of osteoblast differentiation is at least partly induced via PPAR\u03b3-mediated PHD induction and subsequent promotion of the ubiquitination and degradation of Runx2.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Kang, Ju-Hee","Kwak, Hyun Jeong","Choi, Hye-Eun","Kim, Juyoung","Hong, Sangmee","Kim, Ok-Hee","Oh, Byung Chul","Cheon, Hyae Gyeong"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0139093","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T01:03:27+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"9","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1465002186,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26418009?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26418009","pubdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0139093","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Involvement of Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain Protein in the Rosiglitazone-Induced Suppression of Osteoblast Differentiation","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/involvement-prolyl-hydroxylase-domain-protein-rosiglitazoneinduced-suppression-osteoblast-differenti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":6800628,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269232,"mean":11.392744795361,"rank":224356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":110643,"mean":10.29816481987,"rank":93394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":110643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4673,"mean":13.074624571918,"rank":4084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4673,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/hypoxiapapers\/statuses\/738898843190710272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8468752],"posted_on":"2016-06-04T01:03:06+00:00","author":{"name":"Hypoxia Adaptation","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491585034201989120\/716F2y0d_normal.png","description":"A feed for hypoxia related papers published in NCBI, ArXiv, bioArxiv, and PeerJ","id_on_source":"hypoxiapapers","tweeter_id":"2669362848","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":407},"tweet_id":"738898843190710272"}]}}
