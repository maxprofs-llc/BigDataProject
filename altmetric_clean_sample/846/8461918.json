The backfilling process plays an important role in successfully generating biopatterns; however, it has potential disadvantages in several interesting research and technical applications. To overcome the issue, a copolymer system having highly reactive functional groups and bioinert properties was introduced through a surface-initiated controlled radical polymerization with 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA). The prepared poly(AMA-co-OEGMA) film was fully characterized, and among the films, having different thicknesses, the 35-nm-thick biotinylated, poly(AMA-co-OEGMA) film exhibited an optimum performance, such as the lowest nonspecific adsorption and the highest specific binding capability toward proteins.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Lee, Bong Soo","Lee, Juno","Han, Gyeongyeop","Ha, Eun Rae","Choi, Insung","Lee, Jung Kyu","Ha, EunRae","Choi, Insung S.","Lee, Jungkyu K."],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201600585","endpage":"2064","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T14:22:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1861-471X","18614728"],"issue":"14","journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1466841633,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27252120?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/asia.201600585","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201600585?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201600585\/pdf","pmid":"27252120","pubdate":"2016-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2057","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Backfilling-Free Strategy for Biopatterning on Intrinsically Dual-Functionalized Poly[2-Aminoethyl Methacrylate-co-Oligo(Ethylene Glycol) Methacrylate] Films","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/backfillingfree-strategy-biopatterning-intrinsically-dualfunctionalized-poly2aminoethyl-methacrylate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":3237747,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4662058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":270184,"mean":11.385292361103,"rank":99524,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":168321,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":270184,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2421,"mean":1.3799611570248,"rank":220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":2196,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2421,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115,"mean":1.0543859649123,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":2},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"IE":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/TC_papers\/statuses\/738737650719330305","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8461918],"posted_on":"2016-06-03T14:22:35+00:00","author":{"name":"TC_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/507539334375829504\/IcPjrJI3_normal.jpeg","description":"Pubmed twitterbot: arealization OR patterning OR somatosensory OR thalamus OR thalamocortical OR cortical development","id_on_source":"TC_papers","tweeter_id":"2789910212","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":180},"tweet_id":"738737650719330305"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemAsianJ\/statuses\/744825431703101441","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8461918],"posted_on":"2016-06-20T09:33:15+00:00","author":{"name":"Chem.
