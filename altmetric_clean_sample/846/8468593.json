Our objective was to assess the inter- and intraobserver agreement in diagnosing aneurysm remnants and recurrences by using multimodality imaging, including TOF MRA.\nA portfolio composed of 120 selected images from 56 patients was sent to 15 neuroradiologists from 10 institutions. For each case, raters were asked to classify angiographic results (3 classes) of 2 studies (32 MRA-MRA and 24 DSA-MRA pairs) and to provide a final judgment regarding the presence of a recurrence (no, minor, major). Six raters were asked to independently review the portfolio twice. A second study, restricted to 4 raters having full access to all images, was designed to validate the results of the electronic survey.\nThe proportion of cases judged to have a major recurrence varied between 16.1% and 71.4% (mean, 35.0% \u00b1 12.7%). There was moderate agreement overall (\u03ba = 0.474 \u00b1 0.009), increasing to nearly substantial (\u03ba = 0.581 \u00b1 0.014) when the judgment was dichotomized (presence or absence of a major recurrence). Agreement on cases followed-up by MRA-MRA was similarly substantial (\u03ba = 0.601 \u00b1 0.018). The intrarater agreement varied between fair (\u03ba = 0.257 \u00b1 0.093) and substantial (\u03ba= 0.699 \u00b1 0.084), improving with a dichotomized judgment concerning MRA-MRA comparisons. Agreement was no better when raters had access to all images.\nThere is an important variability in the assessment of angiographic outcomes of endovascular treatments. Agreement on the presence of a major recurrence when comparing 2 MRA studies or the MRA with the last catheter angiographic study can be substantial.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006984","authors":["Jamali, S","Fahed, R","Gentric, J-C","Letourneau-Guillon, L","Raoult, H","Bing, F","Estrade, L","Nguyen, T N","Tollard, \u00c9","Ferre, J-C","Iancu, D","Naggara, O","Chagnon, M","Weill, A","Roy, D","Fox, A J","Kallmes, D F","Raymond, J","S.
