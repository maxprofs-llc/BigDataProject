The purpose of this investigation was to describe current cannabis use treatment practices in English-speaking early intervention services (EISs) in Canada and determine if their services are informed by available evidence.\nThirty-five Canadian English-speaking EISs for psychosis were approached to complete a survey through email, facsimile, or online in order to collect information regarding their current cannabis use treatment practices.\nData were acquired from 27 of the 35 (78%) programs approached. Only 12% of EISs offered formal services that targeted cannabis use, whereas the majority (63%) of EISs offered informal services for all substance use, not specifically cannabis. In programs with informal services, individual patient psychoeducation (86%) was slightly more common than individual motivational interviewing (MI) (76%) followed by group patient psychoeducation (52%) and information handouts (52%). Thirty-seven percent of EISs offered formal services for substance use, and compared to programs with informal services, more MI, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and family services were offered, with individual treatment modalities more common than groups. No EISs used contingency management, even though it has some preliminary evidence in chronic populations. Evidence-based service implementation barriers included appropriate training and administrative support.\nWhile most English-speaking Canadian EIS programs offer individual MI and psychoeducation, which is in line with the available literature, there is room for improvement in cannabis treatment services based on current evidence for both people with EPP and their families.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d23cf058f610000db5","authors":["Aydin, Cristina","Tibbo, Philip G","Ursuliak, Zenovia"],"doi":"10.1177\/0706743716639931","endpage":"372","first_seen_on":"2016-06-03T17:47:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1497-0015","0706-7437"],"issue":"6","journal":"Canadian Journal of Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1464979012,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27254846?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4872239","pmid":"27254846","pubdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"367","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Psychosocial Interventions in Reducing Cannabis Use in Early Phase Psychosis: A Canadian Survey of Treatments Offered","type":"article","volume":"61","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychosocial-interventions-reducing-cannabis-early-phase-psychosis-canadian-survey-treatments-offere"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7849747,"mean":6.6509658923939,"rank":6799105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7849747,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269243,"mean":11.375775101952,"rank":224352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269243,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":801,"mean":5.3795675,"rank":660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":801,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":38,"mean":8.3200540540541,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":38,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
