A periodic super-cell approach is used in combination with all-electron basis sets and hybrid functionals of density-functional-theory (DFT), which include a fraction of exact non-local exchange and are known to provide a correct description of the electronic spin localization at the defect, at variance with simpler formulations of the DFT. The effects of both defect concentration and spin state are explicitly addressed. Geometrical constraints are found to prevent the formation of a double bond between the two three-fold coordinated carbon atoms. In contrast, two unpaired electrons are fully localized on each of the carbon atoms involved in the defect. The open-shell singlet state is slightly more stable than the triplet (the energy difference being just 30 meV, as the unpaired electrons occupy orthogonal orbitals) while the closed-shell solution is less stable by about 1.55 eV. The formation energy of the defect from pristine diamond is about 12 eV. The Raman spectrum presents only two peaks of low intensity at wave-numbers higher than the pristine diamond peak (characterized by normal modes extremely localized on the defect), whose positions strongly depend on defect concentration as they blue shift up to 1550 and 1927 cm(-1) at infinite defect dilution. The first of these peaks, also IR active, is characterized by a very high IR intensity, and might then be related to the strong experimental feature of the IR spectrum occurring at 1570 cm(-1). A second very intense IR peak appears at about 500 cm(-1), which, despite being originated from a \"wagging\" motion of the self-interstitial defect, exhibits a more collective, less localized character.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63c3cf058f610008ee3","authors":["Simone Salustro","Alessandro Erba","Claudio Marcelo Zicovich-Wilson","Yves Noel","Lorenzo Maschio","Roberto Dovesi","Salustro, Simone","Erba, Alessandro","Zicovich-Wilson, Claudio M","N\u00f6el, Yves","Maschio, Lorenzo","Dovesi, Roberto","Claudio M.
