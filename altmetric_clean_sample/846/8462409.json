His patient is the earliest documented to have survived appendicectomy. This was confirmed by a post mortem examination 31 years later. Part of the remaining bowel was preserved by William Hunter and this specimen remains in the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4de3cf058f610001cf7","authors":["Peter Selley","P.
