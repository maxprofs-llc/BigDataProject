We studied the role of serotonin in the mechanisms of learning in terrestrial snails. To produce a serotonin deficit, the \"neurotoxic\" analogs of serotonin, 5,6- or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,6\/5,7-DHT) were used. Injection of 5,6\/5,7-DHT was found to disrupt defensive reflex conditioning. Within 2 weeks of neurotoxin application, the ability to learn had recovered. Daily injection of serotonin before a training session accelerated defensive reflex conditioning and daily injections of 5-HTP in snails with a deficiency of serotonin induced by 5,7-DHT restored the snail's ability to learn. We discovered that injections of the neurotoxins 5,6\/5,7-DHT as well as serotonin, caused a decrease in the resting and threshold potentials of the premotor interneurons LPa3 and RPa3.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc09","authors":["Andrianov, Vyatcheslav V.","Bogodvid, Tatiana K.","Deryabina, Irina B.","Golovchenko, Aleksandra N.","Muranova, Lyudmila N.","Tagirova, Roza R.","Vinarskaya, Aliya K.","Gainutdinov, Khalil L."],"doi":"10.3389\/fnbeh.2015.00279","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T08:11:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1662-5153"],"journal":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1445587900,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnbeh.2015.00279\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fnbeh.2015.00279\/pdf","pmid":"26557063","pubdate":"2015-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Modulation of defensive reflex conditioning in snails by serotonin","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modulation-defensive-reflex-conditioning-snails-serotonin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443177,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197243,"mean":10.397359629288,"rank":154883,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197243,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1155,"mean":5.9532842287695,"rank":999,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1155,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":5.425,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":3,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FrontNeurosci\/statuses\/657469424312578048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4664512],"posted_on":"2015-10-23T08:11:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Frontiers Neurosci","url":"http:\/\/frontiersin.org\/Neuroscience","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/533283149308911617\/d_MmvG-x_normal.jpeg","description":"The official Twitter Feed for all the latest open-access, peer-reviewed articles in Frontiers in Neuroscience.","id_on_source":"FrontNeurosci","tweeter_id":"397306055","geo":{"lt":46.516,"ln":6.63282,"country":"CH"},"followers":15530},"tweet_id":"657469424312578048"}]}}
