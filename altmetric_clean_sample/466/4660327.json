The purpose of our study was to compare the clinical outcomes between surgical and non-surgical treatment of colonoscopic perforation.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with colonoscopic perforation, which was treated between January 2005 and December 2014. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they received non-surgical (conservative management or endoscopic clipping) or surgical (primary closure, bowel resection and anastomosis, and\/or faecal diversion) initial treatment for the perforation. Conversion was defined as the change from a non-surgical to surgical procedure after treatment failure.\nOne hundred and nine patients were analysed. Surgical treatment was more common following diagnostic than therapeutic colonoscopic procedures (74.5 vs. 53.7\u00a0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Of 55 patients in the non-surgical group, 11 patients required conversion to surgery. The surgical group comprised 54 patients. The complication rate (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and the length of hospital stay (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significantly greater in the patients requiring conversion than in the surgical group. Multivariate analysis showed that old age, American Society for Anesthesiologists score \u2265\u00a03, and conversion were independent predictors of poor outcomes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively). Only perforation size was associated with conversion in multivariate analysis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022).\nIt is important to select an appropriate treatment in patients with colonoscopic perforation. To avoid non-surgical treatment failure, surgery should be considered in patients with a large perforation. By decreasing the rate of conversion, we might reduce the complication and mortality rates associated with colonoscopic perforation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","authors":["An, Sung Bak","Shin, Dong Woo","Kim, Jeong Yeon","Park, Sung Gil","Lee, Bong Hwa","Kim, Jong Wan"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00464-015-4577-z","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:03:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1445508153,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26487233?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26487233","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:00:43+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Abdominal Surgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gastroenterology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Gynecology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Hepatology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Proctology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Surgery","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Decision-making in the management of colonoscopic perforation: a multicentre retrospective study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decisionmaking-management-colonoscopic-perforation-multicentre-retrospective-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423333,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355821824243,"rank":154508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2775,"mean":1.8107303532805,"rank":1995,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2775,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":2.0344537815126,"rank":86,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1,"MA":1,"DE":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/657134942531391488","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4660327],"posted_on":"2015-10-22T10:02:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":439},"tweet_id":"657134942531391488"}]}}
