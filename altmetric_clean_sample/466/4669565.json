However, cancer is no longer considered a disease caused by a single factor, but is now recognized as a multi-factorial disorder. Genetic, epigenetic and metabolic factors all contribute to neoplasia, causing significant changes in molecular networks that govern cell growth, development, death and specialization. Consequently, many antitumor therapies are no longer directed against a single target but the biological system as a whole, in which functions determining the onset and maintenance of a physio-pathological state are modulated. The field of epi-drug discovery is currently in a transitional phase where the search for putative anticancer drugs is shifting from single-target-oriented molecules to network-active compounds and to epi-drugs used in combination with other epi-agents and with traditional chemotherapeutics. This review illustrates the pros and cons of each therapeutic option, providing examples in support of single-target and multi (network)-target epi-drug approaches.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","authors":["Benedetti, Rosaria","Conte, Mariarosaria","Iside, Concetta","Altucci, Lucia","Rosaria Benedetti","Mariarosaria Conte","Concetta Iside","Lucia Altucci"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.biocel.2015.10.016","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T11:11:01+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1878-5875","13572725"],"journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","last_mentioned_on":1446477780,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494003?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494003?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494003","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.biocel.2015.10.016"],"pmid":"26494003","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:37+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Epigenetic-based therapy: from single- to multi-target approaches.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/epigeneticbased-therapy-single-multitarget-approaches"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6520864,"mean":6.0390053006769,"rank":2413949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4008996,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6520864,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":208662,"mean":10.193887262114,"rank":81228,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":123588,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":208662,"percentile":59},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1023,"mean":3.4215459882583,"rank":456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":557,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1023,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35,"mean":1.0227647058824,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":31,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
