All complexes were tested in vitro for their antiproliferative activity on three tumor cell lines (HeLa, A2780, A2780cisR) and on a non-cancerous cell line (HFL-1). A superior cytotoxic activity of the ruthenium complexes as compared to cisplatin and oxaliplatin, on both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, was observed. In addition, the biological activity of two selected derivatives was evaluated using microarray gene expression assay and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The p53 signaling was identified as an important pathway modulated by both arene ruthenium compounds. New activated molecules such as FAS, ZMAT3, PRMT2, BBC3\/PUMA and PDCD4, whose over-expressions are correlated with overcoming resistance to cisplatin therapy, were also identified as potential targets. Moreover, the arene ruthenium complexes can be used in association with cisplatin to prevent cisplatin resistance development and synergistically to induce cell death in ovarian cancer cells.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Grozav, Adriana","Balacescu, Ovidiu","Balacescu, Loredana","Cheminel, Thomas","Berindan-Neagoe, Ioana","Therrien, Bruno"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.jmedchem.5b00855","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:08:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-4804"],"journal":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1445509354,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26488797?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26488797","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:00:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis, Anticancer Activity and Genome Profiling of Thiazolo Arene Ruthenium Complexes.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-anticancer-activity-genome-profiling-thiazolo-arene-ruthenium-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":2806795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3391316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355811660196,"rank":94797,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":93566,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":47},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3462,"mean":3.9144131753828,"rank":2167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1195,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3462,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":62,"mean":6.7426557377049,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":62,"percentile":41}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
