Understanding the molecular mechanisms of metastatic pathways underlying HNSCC using currently available genomic approaches might improve therapies for and prevention of the disease. Our previous studies showed that three tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-26a\/b, miR-29a\/b\/c and miR-218, significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, we hypothesized that these miRNAs-regulated target genes deeply contributed to cancer metastasis. These tumor-suppressive miRNAs directly regulate LOXL2 expression in HNSCC cells by using in silico analysis and luciferase reporter assays. Overexpressed LOXL2 was confirmed in HNSCC clinical specimens, and silencing of LOXL2 inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion in HNSCC cell lines. Our present data showed that tumor-suppressive miRNAs regulation of LOXL2 will provide new insights into the novel molecular mechanisms of HNSCC metastasis.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 22 October 2015; doi:10.1038\/jhg.2015.120.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de4","authors":["Fukumoto, Ichiro","Kikkawa, Naoko","Matsushita, Ryosuke","Kato, Mayuko","Kurozumi, Akira","Nishikawa, Rika","Goto, Yusuke","Koshizuka, Keiichi","Hanazawa, Toyoyuki","Enokida, Hideki","Nakagawa, Masayuki","Okamoto, Yoshitaka","Seki, Naohiko"],"doi":"10.1038\/jhg.2015.120","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T23:42:19+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1435-232X"],"journal":"Journal of Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1445643723,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26490187?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26490187","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:02:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Head and neck cancer","scheme":"npg"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"Tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miR-26a\/b, miR-29a\/b\/c and miR-218) concertedly suppressed metastasis-promoting LOXL2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tumorsuppressive-micrornas-mir26ab-mir29abc-mir218-concertedly-suppressed-metastasispromoting-loxl2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443246,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197244,"mean":10.397330490816,"rank":154889,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197244,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":751,"mean":5.55376,"rank":709,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":751,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":5.3438888888889,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
