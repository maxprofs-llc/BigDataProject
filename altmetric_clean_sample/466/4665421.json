In this study we investigated the PKM parameters K(trans) , kep and ve in a prospective cohort of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) na\u00efve early arthritis patients and validated our results by correlating them with the number of synovial endothelial cells (EC).\nForty-seven early arthritis patients (arthritis duration<1 year, DMARD na\u00efve; rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n=14), unclassified arthritis (UA; n=22), spondyloarthritis (SpA; n=6), and other arthritides (n=5)) were included. An at baseline DCE-MRI of an inflamed knee joint was performed, and K(trans) , kep and ve were calculated. Secondly, markers of disease activity were collected. Finally, vascularity was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of synovial tissue samples obtained from inflamed knee joints that had been imaged before, using antibodies to detect von Willebrand factor (vWF).\nPKM parameters differed significantly between diagnostic groups at baseline, with the highest K(trans) (median (IQR)) in SpA patients (0.050 min(-1) (0.041-0.069)). Furthermore, K(trans) , kep and ve correlated significantly with markers of disease activity. Finally, PKM parameters correlated significantly with synovial expression of vWF (K(trans) : r=0.647; p=0.004, Kep : r=0.614; p=0.007 and ve : r=0.398; p=0.102).\nThese results suggest that K(trans) , Kep and ve , can be used to detect synovial inflammation in early arthritis patients, and these parameters may assist in differential diagnosis. This approach may also be useful in translational research on tissue microcirculation and angiogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.
