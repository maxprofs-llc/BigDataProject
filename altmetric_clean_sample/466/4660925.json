This is a challenge as most preparations available for this intention are orally administered progestins; however, these drugs may have side effects, especially when used over a long period of time. Long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist implants have been used successfully to suppress the oestrous cycle in cats for a longer period. After removal of the implant, the duration of action was shortened; however, the re-occurrence of normal cyclicity cannot be foreseen. The search for alternatives is therefore ongoing.\nAnother possibility for oestrus control is orally administered melatonin preparations; however, previous studies have shown that the effect was not satisfactory. After subcutaneous application of a melatonin implant developed for induction of oestrus in sheep (Melovine; Ceva Sante Animale), duration of oestrus suppression was shown to differ highly in individuals and in some cases no effect was observed. Nevertheless, it is used for short-term oestrus suppression in female cats. The present review shall therefore provide an overview of recent studies and clinical experiences.\nThis article discusses the use of melatonin as a contraceptive in cats. It shall explain the function of melatonin in cats, discuss previous studies, provide clinical experience with Melovine (27 cases) and elucidate advantages and disadvantages.\nInformation provided in this article is drawn from the published literature and the author's own clinical experience.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c7f","authors":["Sabine Sch\u00e4fer-Somi"],"doi":"10.1177\/1098612x15610369","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:50:06+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-2750"],"journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1445510753,"links":["http:\/\/jfm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/14\/1098612X15610369?papetoc"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jfm.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/14\/1098612X15610369.full.pdf","pmid":"26467539","pubdate":"2015-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"title":"Effect of melatonin on the reproductive cycle in female cats: a review of clinical experiences and previous studies","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-melatonin-reproductive-cycle-female-cats-review-clinical-experiences-previous-studies-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423326,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355815471713,"rank":154505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":870,"mean":3.3994085155351,"rank":488,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":870,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":59,"mean":1.5629310344828,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":59,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
