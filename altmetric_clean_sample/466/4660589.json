Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality or morbidity.\n7,635 patients aged \u226518 years received TAVR during the study period; 84.5% (n = 6,450) underwent transfemoral TAVR and the rest were treated transapically. The median age was 83 years (IQR 77-88 years) and cardiovascular comorbidities were widespread. Overall inhospital mortality was 5.0% (n = 380), and 1.4% (n = 105) of the patients experienced a stroke. All-cause procedure-related morbidity was 24.7% (n = 1,885). Annual hospital TAVR volume did not predict inhospital mortality or morbidity (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.111 and OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.947, respectively).\nOur analysis helps to confirm the short-term safety profile of TAVR and further demonstrates that inhospital outcomes have remained acceptable as this procedure has become commercialized.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024a9","authors":["de Biasi, Andreas R","Paul, Subroto","Nasar, Abu","Girardi, Leonard N","Salemi, Arash"],"doi":"10.1159\/000440694","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:16:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1421-9751"],"issue":"1","journal":"Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1445508967,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26489084?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26489084","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:00:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"National Analysis of Short-Term Outcomes and Volume-Outcome Relationships for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in the Era of Commercialization.","type":"article","volume":"133","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/national-analysis-shortterm-outcomes-volumeoutcome-relationships-transcatheter-aortic-valve-replacem-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355825635761,"rank":154508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":482,"mean":1.4478045738046,"rank":258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":482,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":0.94615384615385,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CardiologiaF\/statuses\/657138356208295936","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4660589],"posted_on":"2015-10-22T10:16:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiolog\u00eda-Fabumed","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1561758151\/fabumed_normal.png","description":"Cardiolog\u00eda.
