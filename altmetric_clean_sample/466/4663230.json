Peripheral nervous system involvement is common. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement, most commonly presenting with lymphocytic meningitis, causes modest cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Parenchymal CNS infection is rare. If the CNS is invaded, however, measuring local production of anti-B burgdorferi antibodies in the CSF provides a useful marker of infection. Most cases of neuroborreliosis can be cured with oral doxycycline; parenteral regimens should be reserved for patients with particularly severe disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f610005816","authors":["Halperin, John J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cll.2015.07.002","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T23:37:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02722712","1557-9832"],"issue":"4","journal":"Clinics in laboratory medicine","last_mentioned_on":1445557027,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0272271215000955&_version=1&md5=b239e1570111e0bdec47c9b57c70071d"],"pmid":"26593257","pubdate":"2015-11-25T22:03:01+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Nervous System Lyme Disease ","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/central-nervous-system-lyme-disease-10"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423407,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355777356535,"rank":154515,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":1.7510534351145,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":4.19,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
