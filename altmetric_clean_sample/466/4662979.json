Questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic, occupational, and health-related data. Workers who reported that they worked in places where they needed to shout in order to be heard were considered to be exposed to noise. Exposed workers were asked whether they used hearing protection devices, and if so, how frequently. Analyses were conducted according to gender, with estimates made about prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices, prevalence ratios, and their respective 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS Twelve percent (12.3%) of study subjects reported that they were exposed to noise while working. Prevalence of the use of hearing protection devices was 59.3% for men and 21.4% for women. Men from higher socioeconomic levels (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.14;1.90) and who had previous audiometric tests (PR = 1.47; 95%CI 1.15;1.88) were more likely to use hearing protection devices. For women, greater perceived safety was associated with the use of protection devices (PR = 2.92; 95%CI 1.34;6.34). This perception was specifically related to the presence of supervisors committed to safety (PR = 2.09; 95%CI 1.04;4.21), the existence of clear rules to prevent workplace injuries (PR = 2.81; 95%CI 1.41;5.59), and whether they were informed about workplace safety (PR = 2.42; 95%CI 1.23;4.76).CONCLUSIONS There is a gender bias regarding the use of hearing protection devices that is less favorable to women. The use of such devices among women is positively influenced by their perception of a safe workplace, suggesting that gender should be considered as a factor in hearing conservation programs.","authors":["Meira, Tatiane Costa","Santana, Vilma Sousa","Ferrite, Silvia","Meira, Tatiane Costa","Santana, Vilma Sousa","Ferrite, Silvia"],"doi":"10.1590\/s0034-8910.2015049005708","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T21:08:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0034-8910","1518-8787"],"journal":"Revista de sa\u00fade p\u00fablica","last_mentioned_on":1445548069,"links":["http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-89102015000100259&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt#.VilQHcGse2A.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.scielo.br\/pdf\/rsp\/v49\/pt_0034-8910-rsp-S0034-89102015049005708.pdf","pmid":"26487294","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:00:42+00:00","publisher":"Faculdade de Sa\u00fade P\u00fablica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"G\u00eanero e fatores associados ao uso de equipamento de prote\u00e7\u00e3o auditiva no trabalho","type":"article","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/gender-other-factors-associated-hearing-protection-devices-work"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
