In this study, we found that ectopic expression of HBx in human hepatocytes using overexpression and 1.2-mer HBV replicon systems upregulated levels of the transcriptional repressors, E12 and E47, resulting in inactivation of the E-cadherin promoter, containing three E-box motifs, and subsequent repression of its expression. E12\/E47 knock-down using a specific siRNA almost completely abolished the potential of HBx to repress E-cadherin expression. HBx inhibited the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of E12\/E47 without affecting their expression at the transcriptional level. Upregulation of E12\/E47 by HBx ultimately led to EMT in human hepatocytes, as demonstrated by morphological changes, altered protein levels of EMT markers, including E-cadherin, plakoglobin, fibronectin, vimentin, and N-cadherin, and increased capacity for cell detachment and migration.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c9c","authors":["Kim, Soo Shin","Yeom, Sujeong","Kwak, Juri","Ahn, Hyung-Jun","Jang, Kyung Lib"],"doi":"10.1099\/jgv.0.000324","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T14:35:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1465-2099"],"journal":"Journal of General Virology","last_mentioned_on":1445594677,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26490105?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26490105","pubdate":"2015-10-23T22:00:58+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Hepatitis B virus X protein induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by repressing E-cadherin expression via upregulation of E12\/E47.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatitis-b-virus-x-protein-induces-epithelialmesenchymal-transition-repressing-ecadherin-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197244,"mean":10.397313253195,"rank":154886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197244,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1258,"mean":2.9871678599841,"rank":1053,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1258,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":56,"mean":1.3378181818182,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":56,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VirologyNews365\/statuses\/657497846795534336","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4665106],"posted_on":"2015-10-23T10:04:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Virology News","url":"http:\/\/biotech-365.com\/virology-news\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/560488839022530562\/p6EjWxrK_normal.jpeg","description":"Virology News : http:\/\/t.co\/NLwUB7mzg1 #virology #virus #viruses","id_on_source":"VirologyNews365","tweeter_id":"3003510675","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1592},"tweet_id":"657497846795534336"}]}}
