Guideline topics include postoperative care, hemodynamic monitoring, arrhythmia management, and nutrition. These evidence-based care guidelines were presented at the 10th International Meeting of PCICS and have been utilized in the preparation of this article. They can be accessed at http:\/\/www.pcics.org\/resources\/pediatric-neonatal\/. Utilization of these guidelines in practice is illustrated for single ventricle stage 1 palliation, Fontan operation, truncus arteriosus, and atrioventricular septal defect.","authors":["Lindsey Justice","Misty Ellis","Cecilia St George-Hyslop","Amy Donnellan","Amiee Trauth","Brenda Drouillard","Claire Watt","Louise Callow"],"doi":"10.1177\/2150135115593131","endpage":"615","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T15:36:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["2150-136X"],"issue":"4","journal":"World Journal for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1445608059,"links":["http:\/\/pch.sagepub.com\/content\/6\/4\/604.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pch.sagepub.com\/content\/6\/4\/604.full.pdf","pmid":"26467875","pubdate":"2015-10-14T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"604","title":"Utilizing the PCICS Nursing Guidelines in Managing the CICU Patient","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/utilizing-pcics-nursing-guidelines-managing-cicu-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
