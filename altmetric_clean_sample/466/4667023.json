After admission, surgical debridement was performed timely, and the necrotic tissue was collected during the operation for pathological observation after HE staining. After the operation, VSD was started with negative pressure ranging from -100 to -80 kPa, and the furacilin solution (0.2 g\/L) and oxygen (2 L\/min) were continuously infused into the wound during the treatment. Surgical debridement was performed repeatedly according to the wound condition followed by change of VSD dressings to continue VSD treatment. The wounds were closed by suturing or with autologous skin grafts after being covered by fresh granulation tissue. The times of surgical debridement, times of change of VSD materials, wound healing status, and length of stay in our institute were recorded. All patients were followed up for a long time. Results HE staining showed that there were diffuse necrotic adipose and fibrous connective tissues in the necrotic tissue, and the normal tissue structure disappeared accompanied by significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. The number of surgical debridement was 2 to 10 (3.9 +\/- 2.8) times. The number of VSD materials change was 2 to 10 (4.0 +\/- 2.9) times. Wounds were closed by suturing and healed in two patients; wounds in the other six patients were partially sutured, their residual wounds were healed by autologous skin grafting. The length of stay in our institute was 20 to 49 (33 +\/- 10) days. All patients were discharged after recovery. Patients were followed up for 2 to 24 months, and their wounds were found to be in good condition without ulceration or recurrence.\nVSD can effectively remove the necrotic tissues and exudates from the fascial spaces and promote proliferation of granulation tissue. Therefore it serves as an effective approach to the treatment of severe necrotizing fasciitis in extremities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca5","authors":["Li, Longzhu","Li, Dawei","Shen, Chuanan","Li, Dongjie","Cai, Jianhua","Tuo, Xiaoye","Zhang, Lin"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T16:14:38+00:00","issns":["1009-2587"],"issue":"2","journal":"Zhonghua shao shang za zhi Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi Chinese journal of burns","last_mentioned_on":1445595272,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26320313?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26320313","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[Application of vacuum sealing drainage in the treatment of severe necrotizing fasciitis in extremities of patients].","type":"article","volume":"31","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/application-vacuum-sealing-drainage-treatment-severe-necrotizing-fasciitis-extremities-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443187,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197245,"mean":10.397263075176,"rank":154887,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197245,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":0.60217391304348,"rank":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":1.05,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
