We used Nielsen scanner data from 2009, 2010 and 2011 to measure the price of Marlboro cartons in US grocery stores.\nThe odds of ICVs claiming tax-free status were higher in 2011 than in 2009 (OR=1.58, p<0.01). Mixed location and international vendors had higher odds of promoting tax-free sales than US-based ICVs (OR=4.95 and 6.23, respectively, both p<0.001). In 2011, the average price of one Marlboro carton was $35.27 online, compared to $52.73 in US grocery stores. We estimated that in 2011, a pack-a-day smoker living in an area with high cigarette prices would save $1508 per year buying cigarettes online.\nICVs commonly promote tax-free sales, and cigarettes are cheaper online compared to US grocery stores. Better enforcement of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act is needed to address tax-free cigarette sales among ICVs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003670","authors":["Marissa G Hall","Rebecca S Williams","Doris G Gammon","Kurt M Ribisl","Hall, Marissa G","Williams, Rebecca S","Gammon, Doris G","Ribisl, Kurt M"],"doi":"10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359","endpage":"618","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T18:59:13+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1468-3318","0964-4563"],"issue":"6","journal":"Tobacco Control","last_mentioned_on":1481127530,"links":["http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/21\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359.abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26490844?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/m.tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/21\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2015\/10\/21\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359.full.pdf","pmid":"26490844","pubdate":"2015-10-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"tobaccocontrol-2015-052359","subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Internet cigarette vendors make tax-free claims and sell cigarettes cheaper than retail outlets","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/tobaccocontrol.bmj.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.1136\/tobaccocontrol-2015-052359","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/internet-cigarette-vendors-make-taxfree-claims-sell-cigarettes-cheaper-retail-outlets"},"altmetric_score":{"score":46.4,"score_history":{"1y":39,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":46.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7856296,"mean":6.655704591281,"rank":175979,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":7680319,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7856296,"percentile":97},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241554,"mean":9.5452646665534,"rank":9793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":231753,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241554,"percentile":95},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1817,"mean":19.004589207048,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":1670,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1817,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":17.452368421053,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":35,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":6,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"CA":1,"IE":1,"ES":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MaloneRuth\/statuses\/657269909437612032","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4662650],"posted_on":"2015-10-22T18:58:52+00:00","author":{"name":"Ruth Malone","url":"http:\/\/nursing.ucsf.edu\/faculty\/ruth-malone","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/796809590486614016\/5TFfTGVP_normal.jpg","description":"Prof.Nursing & #PublicHealth #Policy UC #SanFrancisco; editor, #Tobacco Control journal; #environmentalist; citizen human resisting #corporate consumer identity","id_on_source":"MaloneRuth","tweeter_id":"627017650","geo":{"lt":37.77493,"ln":-122.41942,"country":"US"},"followers":1872},"tweet_id":"657269909437612032"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SmokersMatch\/statuses\/657270125675040768","license":"gnip","rt":["MaloneRuth"],"citation_ids":[4662650],"posted_on":"2015-10-22T18:59:44+00:00","author":{"name":"Smokers Match","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/557544206508367872\/jME8tt7N_normal.jpeg","description":"Love smokers? #SmokersMatch lets you find people who like #smoking too.
