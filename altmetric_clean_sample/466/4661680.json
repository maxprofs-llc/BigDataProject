In this issue of the Journal, Murnane et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;000(00):000-000) use data from the Partners PrEP Study (Kenya and Uganda, 2008-2011) to estimate the efficacy of PrEP under perfect adherence. We discuss Murnane et al.'s work and then examine the larger issues of generalizability or transportability of findings from a randomized trial to a new setting when adherence to an intervention determines its effectiveness. We discuss sufficient conditions for generalizability and use causal directed acyclic graphs to show how these assumptions might play out when trials are used to make inferences about the effect of PrEP in current and future real-world target populations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021f7","authors":["Daniel Westreich","Jessie K.
