Breast, lung and pancreatic cancers are in turn the greatest causes of mortality. While age itself is not an obstacle to surgical or oncological treatments, implementation of the treatments in the elderly are often associated with challenges due to primary diseases and diminished function of organs. One of the greatest practical problems is the exclusion of elderly patients from clinical cancer trials.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9183cf058f61000d1ef","authors":["Karihtala, Peeter","Puistola, Ulla"],"first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:15:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0012-7183"],"issue":"16","journal":"Duodecim l\u00e4\u00e4ketieteellinen aikakauskirja","last_mentioned_on":1445508907,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26485944?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26485944","pubdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"[Cancer in an elderly woman].","type":"article","volume":"131","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cancer-elderly-woman"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196774,"mean":10.355774277975,"rank":154508,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196774,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":143,"mean":1.030985915493,"rank":74,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":143,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":2,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/657138102499053568","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4660557],"posted_on":"2015-10-22T10:15:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":713},"tweet_id":"657138102499053568"}]}}
