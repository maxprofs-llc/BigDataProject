Their intracellular targets are the major serine\/threonine protein phosphatases. This review summarizes mechanisms believed to be responsible for the death induction and tumor promotion with focus on the interdependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of Ca(2+)\/calmodulin kinase II (CaM-KII). New data are presented using inhibitors of specific ROS producing enzymes to curb nodularin\/MC-induced liver cell (hepatocyte) death. They indicate that enzymes of the arachidonic acid pathway, notably phospholipase A2, 5-lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenases, may be required for nodularin\/MC-induced (and presumably OA-induced) cell death, suggesting new ways to overcome at least some aspects of OA and MC toxicity.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Rune Kleppe"],"doi":"10.3390\/md13106505","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T00:04:14+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"10","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1445946583,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/13\/10\/6505"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/13\/10\/6505\/pdf","pmid":"26506362","pubdate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Cell Death Inducing Microbial Protein Phosphatase Inhibitors\u2014Mechanisms of Action","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cell-death-inducing-microbial-protein-phosphatase-inhibitorsmechanisms-action"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6496325,"mean":6.0089414145595,"rank":3072275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1943522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6496325,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207681,"mean":10.214035891756,"rank":111036,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":75507,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207681,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":795,"mean":3.3240352644836,"rank":423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":281,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":795,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":4.0038857142857,"rank":43,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":27,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":38}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
