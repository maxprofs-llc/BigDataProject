Two-stages (as group 1) and one-stage strategies (as group 2) to establish the multiple -tracts were performed. A total of 145 pairs were matched for the analysis according to age, preoperative hemoglobin, preoperative urine culture, stone surface area, and stone size.\n45.5% of success rate of patients in group 2 were achieved after a single procedure with a mean of 2.63\u00b10.62 tracts. The remaining patients required a second procedure, necessitating the placement of multiple tracts or the use of the existing tracts again. The final success rate was similar in both Group 1 and Group 2 (82.1% vs. 84.2% (p=0.638). There was a significantly decrease in the mean number of total access tracts, infection complications, and blood transfusion rate in Group 1 than in Group 2. The infection and bleeding complications were similar for both Groups during the subsequent treatment.\nThe two-stage MPCNL treatment plan for staghorn stones was more advantageous for two reasons: (1) Almost half of the patients who were treated using a one-stage treatment plan required subsequent procedure to achieve a satisfactory success rate. (2) An initial treatment plan using the two-stage approach resulted in less complication and less tracts established.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036e4","authors":["Zhao, Zhijian","Cui, Zenlin","Zeng, Tao","Wan, Shaw P","Zeng, Guohua"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.urology.2015.09.006","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T00:23:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0090-4295","1527-9995"],"journal":"Urology","last_mentioned_on":1445658148,"links":["http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090-4295(15)00877-8\/abstract?rss=yes"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.goldjournal.net\/article\/S0090429515008778\/pdf","pmid":"26505833","pubdate":"2015-10-28T22:00:21+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Comparison of One-Stage versus Two-Stages Multiple \u2013tracts Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for the Treatment of Staghorn Stones: A Matched Cohorts Analysis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-1stage-2stage-multipletracts-minipercutaneous-nephrolithotomy-treatment-staghorn-stones-m"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6405271,"mean":5.9851994276586,"rank":2770447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":3581073,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6405271,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197355,"mean":10.379142414139,"rank":93203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":102269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197355,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2379,"mean":3.2991682085786,"rank":1082,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":1251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2379,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125,"mean":2.1568548387097,"rank":51,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":68,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":3,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Arts and Humanities":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2},"mendeley":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/UrologyMatch\/statuses\/657713715844939776","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[4668497],"posted_on":"2015-10-24T00:22:24+00:00","author":{"name":"Urology Match","url":"http:\/\/www.urologymatch.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/670243589750935552\/vkJCRb_7_normal.jpg","description":"Premier Internet portal to keep abreast of the exciting field of Urology.
