High levels of VAs such as tetracyclines (TCs) have been reported in agricultural soils amended with manure, which also has the potential to cause surface and groundwater contamination. Several recent studies have focused on developing methods to immobilize VAs such as composting with straw, hardwood chips, commercial biochar, aeration, mixing, heat treatment, etc. The major shortcomings of these methods include high cost and limited effectiveness. In the current study, we assessed the effectiveness of aluminum-based drinking water treatment residuals (Al-WTR) as a \"green\" sorbent to immobilize TCs in manure and manure-applied soils with varying physicochemical properties by laboratory incubation study. Results show that Al-WTR is very effective in immobilizing tetracycline (TTC) and oxytetracycline (OTC). The presence of phosphate resulted in significant (p\u2009<\u20090.01) decrease in TTC\/OTC sorption by Al-WTR, but the presence of sulfate did not. attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy indicate that TTC and OTC likely forming surface complexes via inner-sphere-type bonds in soils, manure, and manure-applied soils amended with Al-WTR.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6043cf058f61000653d","authors":["Punamiya, Pravin","Sarkar, Dibyendu","Rakshit, Sudipta","Elzinga, Evert J","Datta, Rupali"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11356-015-5551-y","first_seen_on":"2015-10-23T16:16:47+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1614-7499"],"journal":"Environmental Science & Pollution Research","last_mentioned_on":1445594765,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26490907?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26490907","pubdate":"2015-10-23T22:00:41+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Atmospheric Protection\/Air Quality Control\/Air Pollution","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ecotoxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environment, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Waste Water Technology \/ Water Pollution Control \/ Water Management \/ Aquatic Pollution","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Immobilization of tetracyclines in manure and manure-amended soils using aluminum-based drinking water treatment residuals.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immobilization-tetracyclines-manure-manureamended-soils-using-aluminumbased-drinking-water-treatment"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6391435,"mean":5.9810902648762,"rank":5443185,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6391435,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197244,"mean":10.397313253195,"rank":154886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197244,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1558,"mean":2.1655105973025,"rank":899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1558,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":0.96717557251908,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
