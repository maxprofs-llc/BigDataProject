We show that CGK733 induces LC3 II and LC3-puncta accumulation, which are not involved in the activation of autophagy. The treatment of CGK733 did not alter the autophagic flux and was unrelated to p62 degradation. Treatment with CGK733 activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase\/CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (PERK\/CHOP) pathways and elevated the expression of p21Waf1\/Cip1. Inhibition of both AMPK and PERK\/CHOP pathways by siRNA or chemical inhibitor could block CGK733-induced p21Waf1\/Cip1 expression as well as caspase-3 cleavage. Knockdown of LC3 B (but not LC3 A) abolished CGK733-triggered LC3 II accumulation and consequently diminished AMPK and PERK\/CHOP activity as well as p21Waf1\/Cip1 expression. Our results demonstrate that CGK733-triggered LC3 II formation is an initial event upstream of the AMPK and PERK\/CHOP pathways, both of which control p21Waf1\/Cip1 expression.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Wang, Yufeng","Kuramitsu, Yasuhiro","Baron, Byron","Kitagawa, Takao","Tokuda, Kazuhiro","Akada, Junko","Nakamura, Kazuyuki"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.5625","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T10:24:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"issue":"37","journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1445509447,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26486079?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmcid":"PMC4741855","pmid":"26486079","pubdate":"2015-10-22T22:01:06+00:00","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"CGK733-induced LC3 II formation is positively associated with the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1\/Cip1 through modulation of the AMPK and PERK\/CHOP signaling pathways.","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cgk733induced-lc3-ii-formation-positively-associated-expression-cyclindependent-kinase-inhibitor-p21"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":5423329,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355812930702,"rank":154505,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5818,"mean":1.9700656695891,"rank":3525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5818,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":874,"mean":1.400421534937,"rank":536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":874,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
