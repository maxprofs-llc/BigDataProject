In addition, we investigated potential relationship between the levels of ESR and hsCRP with clinical findings and radiographic severity.\nWe compared ESR and hsCRP level between 104 patients with KOA (KOA group; 25 men, 79 women; mean age, 73 years) and 50 patients without KOA (non-KOA group; 16 men, 34 women; mean age, 64 years) excluding any patients with comorbid joint osteoarthrithis, rheumatoid arthritis, malignant tumours, or inflammatory diseases. In the KOA group, we assessed whether ESR and hsCRP level differed in clinical features and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grades.\nESR and hsCRP were significantly higher in the KOA group than in the non-KOA group (p = 0.0013 and 0.00010, respectively). In the KOA group, ESR was significantly elevated in patients with tenderness and patellar ballottement (p = 0.032 and 0.038, respectively), and hsCRP level was significantly elevated in patients with tenderness, swelling, and patellar ballottement (p = 0.0042, 0.00030, and 0.019, respectively). ESR in KL-I was lower than ESR in KL-III and -IV (p = 0.012 and 0.037, respectively). ESR in KL-II did not significantly differ from ESR in the other groups. hsCRP level was lower in grade I than in KL-II, -III, and -IV (p = 0.044, 0.0085, and 0.049, respectively).\nESR and hsCRP level were higher in patients with KOA and were related to clinical features. In KOA, hsCRP level may increase in early-stage KL-II.
