Mechanisms proposed include depletion of the intracellular GTP pool, immunomodulatory effects, induction of error catastrophe, inhibition of viral polymerase activity, and\/or inhibition of viral capping. In the present study, we leveraged deep sequencing data to demonstrate that Ribavirin increases murine norovirus (MNV-1) viral diversity. By serial passaging MNV-1 in RAW 264.7 cells for twenty generations in the presence of Ribavirin, we demonstrated statistically significant increases in both the number of unique haplotypes and the average pairwise difference (APD). Based on statistically significant differences in the probability of nucleotide mutations based on Roche 454 sequencing, we also demonstrated that single nucleotide substitutions are increased in the presence of Ribavirin. Finally, we demonstrated Ribavirin's impact on statistically significantly reducing the relative proportion of the dominant sequence within the quasispecies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003708","authors":["Julian, Timothy R","Baugher, Joseph D","Rippinger, Christine","Pinekenstein, Rebecca","Kolawole, Abimbola O","Mehoke, Thomas","Wobus, Christiane E","Feldman, Andrew","Pineda, Fernando J","Schwab, Kellogg J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.virusres.2015.10.016","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T11:18:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1872-7492"],"journal":"Virus Research","last_mentioned_on":1445685481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494169?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26494169","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:34+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Murine norovirus (MNV-1) exposure in vitro to the purine nucleoside analog Ribavirin increases quasispecies diversity.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/murine-norovirus-mnv1-exposure-vitro-purine-nucleoside-analog-ribavirin-increases-quasispecies-diver"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6405271,"mean":5.9851994276586,"rank":5456703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6405271,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197359,"mean":10.378934332533,"rank":154986,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197359,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":822,"mean":1.7763824604141,"rank":594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":822,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":1.3265625,"rank":45,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
