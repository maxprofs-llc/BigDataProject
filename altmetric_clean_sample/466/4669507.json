However, the cellular mechanism for serotonergic modulation of neuronal excitability remains unclear. We performed patch-clamp recording at the axon of layer-5 pyramidal neurons in rodent PFC slices. We found surprisingly that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors selectively inhibits Na(+) currents obtained at the axon initial segment (AIS) but not those at the axon trunk. In addition, Na(+) channel subtype NaV1.2 but not NaV1.6 at the AIS is selectively modulated by 5-HT1A receptors. Further experiments revealed that the inhibitory effect is attributable to a depolarizing shift of the activation curve and a facilitation of slow inactivation of AIS Na(+) currents. Consistently, dual somatic and axonal recording and simulation results demonstrate that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors could decrease the success rate of action potential (AP) backpropagation toward the somatodendritic compartments, enhancing the segregation of axonal and dendritic activities. Together, our results reveal a selective modulation of NaV1.2 distributed at the proximal AIS region and AP backpropagation by 5-HT1A receptors, suggesting a potential mechanism for serotonergic regulation of functional polarization in the dendro-axonal axis, synaptic plasticity and PFC functions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e36","authors":["Yin, Luping","Rasch, Malte J","He, Quansheng","Wu, Si","Dou, Fei","Shu, Yousheng"],"doi":"10.1093\/cercor\/bhv245","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T11:05:00+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2199"],"journal":"Cerebral Cortex","last_mentioned_on":1445684674,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26494800?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26494800","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:20+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["brain"],"title":"Selective Modulation of Axonal Sodium Channel Subtypes by 5-HT1A Receptor in Cortical Pyramidal Neuron.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/selective-modulation-axonal-sodium-channel-subtypes-5ht-sub1asub-receptor-cortical-pyramidal-neuron"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6405271,"mean":5.9851994276586,"rank":3020426,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1915986,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6405271,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":197359,"mean":10.378934332533,"rank":104726,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":197359,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2167,"mean":8.5530083102493,"rank":1471,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2167,"percentile":20},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":91,"mean":12.464466666667,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":91,"percentile":10}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
