Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty is also a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the severity of dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of frailty was ascertained using six different self-report questionnaires with proven construct validity. Correlation analysis between frailty severity and ECG was made, and those with significant association entered into multiple regression analysis for confirmation. Among a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly associated with QRS duration (r = - 0.3, p < 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a significant relationship exists between the severity of frailty and QRS duration in ESRD patients. This might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its adverse cardiovascular impact in these patients.","altmetric_jid":"521f51273cf0582f62000000","authors":["Chia-Ter Chao","Jenq-Wen Huang"],"doi":"10.7717\/peerj.1354","first_seen_on":"2015-10-22T09:24:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2167-8359"],"journal":"PeerJ","last_mentioned_on":1445526998,"links":["https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1354\/"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/peerj.com\/articles\/1354.pdf","pmid":"26528415","pubdate":"2015-10-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"PeerJ Inc.","title":"Frailty severity is significantly associated with electrocardiographic QRS duration in chronic dialysis patients","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/frailty-severity-significantly-associated-electrocardiographic-qrs-duration-chronic-dialysis-patient"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6367740,"mean":5.9832485888635,"rank":3001374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1903341,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6367740,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196773,"mean":10.355771004005,"rank":104417,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":72240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196773,"percentile":36},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2558,"mean":20.760693781776,"rank":2195,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":262,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2558,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235,"mean":19.926145299145,"rank":199,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":11,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235,"percentile":11}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
