To better understand the structure activity relationships of damaged chromatin, mono and dinucleosomes containing site-specific damage have been prepared and studied. This review will focus on the design, synthesis, and characterization of model systems of damaged chromatin for structural, physical, and enzymatic studies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002726","authors":["Taylor, John-Stephen"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.dnarep.2015.09.025","endpage":"67","first_seen_on":"2015-10-24T11:28:19+00:00","funders":["niehs","nci"],"issns":["1568-7856","15687864"],"journal":"DNA Repair","last_mentioned_on":1445689774,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26493358?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26493358","pubdate":"2015-10-24T22:00:55+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"59","subjects":["molecularbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Design, synthesis, and characterization of nucleosomes containing site-specific DNA damage.","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/design-synthesis-characterization-nucleosomes-containing-sitespecific-dna-damage-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6561399,"mean":6.0801636599394,"rank":4612418,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":1708146,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6561399,"percentile":26},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":209395,"mean":10.209084118934,"rank":134074,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":65384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":209395,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":423,"mean":1.85563507109,"rank":237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":166,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":423,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":0.76129032258065,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
