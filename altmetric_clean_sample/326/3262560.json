The rDNA restriction fragment and orthogonal field alternating gel electrophoresis profiles of opaque and white phenotypes are indistinguishable, and a genetic marker introduced into a white strain is present in all opaque derivatives of this strain. Opaque and white derivatives appear markedly different on a bismuth indicator medium and differ in a number of other respects. We have used bismuth medium to examine the spontaneous and temperature-induced frequencies of transition from opaque to white. The temperature-induced transition from opaque to white does not occur when opaque cells are held in water.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cba","authors":["E H Rikkerink","B B Magee","P T Magee"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T09:47:46+00:00","issns":["0021-9193"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","last_mentioned_on":1491527062,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2828333","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC210739","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC210739"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC210739\/pdf\/jbacter00180-0419.pdf","pmcid":"PMC210739","pmid":"2828333","pubdate":"1988-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology (ASM)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"895","subjects":["bacteriology"],"title":"Opaque-white phenotype transition: a programmed morphological transition in Candida albicans.","type":"article","volume":"170","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/opaquewhite-phenotype-transition-programmed-morphological-transition-candida-albicans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":1985988,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4922677,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":238411,"mean":8.1420525397426,"rank":67710,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":165371,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":238411,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4206,"mean":3.3980456599287,"rank":829,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":1712,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4206,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":43,"mean":1.327380952381,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":43,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":11,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
