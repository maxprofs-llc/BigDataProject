We compared these two systems in the same cohort of patients with primary systemic vasculitis. Twenty-four patients were studied and, applying the 1990 ACR criteria, the diagnoses were Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) (15), Churg Strauss syndrome (CSS) (4), polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) (2) and unclassified (3). Using the CHCC definitions, the diagnoses were WG (5), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) (8), possible MPA (1), PAN (1) and undefined (9). There was concordance in only five patients (all WG). Significant discordance exists between these two criteria sets. Since the ACR criteria set does not include MPA, WG tends to be overdiagnosed. The Chapel Hill definitions are biopsy dependent and surrogate features for the defining histology are required to allow their practical application.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9163cf058f61000d007","authors":["I N Bruce","A L Bell"],"doi":"10.1093\/rheumatology\/36.4.453","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T15:32:36+00:00","issns":["1462-0332","0263-7103"],"journal":"British journal of rheumatology","last_mentioned_on":1275227992,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/rheumatology\/36.4.453","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9159539"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/36\/4\/453.full.pdf","pmid":"9159539","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"subjects":["rheumatology"],"title":"A comparison of two nomenclature systems for primary systemic vasculitis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-two-nomenclature-systems-primary-systemic-vasculitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4510149,"mean":5.2636614770391,"rank":1037641,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":2907841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4510149,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149902,"mean":8.7583022394784,"rank":43273,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":104756,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149902,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.8142857142857,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":2,"Other":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":2,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":3}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"IT":1}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=365024805#altmetric_citation_12","license":"public","citation_ids":[3267813],"posted_on":"2010-05-30T13:59:52+00:00","summary":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), the disease formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), is a systemic disorder that involves both granulomatosis and polyangiitis.","page_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?curid=794996","wiki_lang":"en","author":{"name":"Gabbe","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Gabbe"}}]}}
