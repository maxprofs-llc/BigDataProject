The diagnosis of human brucellosis can be protracted because the disease primarily presents as fever of unknown origin with unspecific clinical signs and symptoms. The isolation rate of the fastidious etiologic agent from blood cultures is low, and therefore laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on serologic and molecular testing. However, seronegative brucellosis patients have been described, and antibody titers of diagnostic significance are difficult to define. Whether the molecular detection of Brucella DNA in clinical samples should be followed by long-term antibiotic treatment or not is also a matter of debate. The aim of this article is to review and discuss the implications of laboratory test results in the diagnosis of human brucellosis on disease therapy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f6100073ca","authors":["Sascha Al Dahouk"],"doi":"10.1586\/eri.11.55","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T10:28:37+00:00","issns":["1478-7210"],"issue":"7","journal":"Expert Review of Anti-Infective Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1419771901,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1586\/eri.11.55"],"pmid":"21810055","pubdate":"2011-08-04T23:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Implications of laboratory diagnosis on brucellosis therapy.","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/implications-laboratory-diagnosis-brucellosis-therapy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4691823,"mean":5.4318361211662,"rank":1091304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":3022346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4691823,"percentile":64},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":158135,"mean":8.7741691097425,"rank":45966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":110137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":158135,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":2.7161573604061,"rank":61,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":289,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":73},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":22,"mean":1.9404761904762,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":22,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":12,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
