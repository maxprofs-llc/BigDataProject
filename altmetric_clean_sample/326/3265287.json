Whether other ECG leads too show comparable QT prolongation is not known. We studied moxifloxacin-induced QT prolongation in a thorough QT study in healthy subjects (54 males, 43 females). Placebo-subtracted change from baseline in QTc corrected by Fridericia's method (\u0394\u0394QTcF) at 1, 1.5, 2 and 4 hours after moxifloxacin was studied in all 12 leads. Unacceptably wide 90% confidence interval (CI) for \u0394\u0394QTcF was seen in three leads; these leads also had maximum ECGs with flat T waves (60% in aVL, 45% in lead III and 42% in V1). After excluding ECGs with flat T waves, 90% lower CI of \u0394\u0394QTcF was \u2265 5 ms in all leads except leads III, aVL and V1 in men. The 90% lower CI exceeded 5 ms in these leads in women despite wide 90% CIs because of greater mean \u0394\u0394QTcF. Leads III, aVL and V1 should be avoided when measuring QT interval in thorough QT studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c56","doi":"10.1016\/j.jelectrocard.2013.11.004","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T11:11:39+00:00","issns":["0022-0736"],"journal":"Journal of Electrocardiology","last_mentioned_on":1408257193,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jelectrocard.2013.11.004","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24388488"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.jecgonline.com\/article\/S0022073613005682\/pdf","pmid":"24388488","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"Drug-induced QT prolongation when QT interval is measured in each of the 12 ECG leads in men and women in a thorough QT study.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/druginduced-qt-prolongation-qt-interval-measured-each-12-ecg-leads-men-women-thorough-qt-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4148169,"mean":5.1155399677872,"rank":967024,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2618550,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4148169,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131807,"mean":8.9874644098146,"rank":40320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":89620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131807,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":132,"mean":4.3320916030534,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":132,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":13.578125,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
