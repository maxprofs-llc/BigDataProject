The aim of this research was, therefore, to evaluate the clinical features and comorbidity of Italian patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of kleptomania. Twenty outpatients with a lifetime diagnosis of kleptomania by DSM-IV criteria, were included in the study and underwent a specially designed semistructured interview and the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria. The majority of patients reported an early and abrupt onset and an episodic course of the disorder, with no gender preponderance. Lifetime comorbidity for other axis I disorders was high, in particular for mood, anxiety, and impulse control disorders. Family history also showed a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Our study indicates clear connections between kleptomania and different psychiatric disorders, the exact nature of which has yet to be clarified.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582e","authors":["Silvio Presta","Donatella Marazziti","Liliana Dell'Osso","Chiara Pfanner","Stefano Pallanti","Giovanni B Cassano"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T08:26:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0010-440X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1187375397,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11788913"],"pmid":"11788913","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Kleptomania: clinical features and comorbidity in an Italian sample.","type":"article","volume":"43","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/kleptomania-clinical-features-comorbidity-italian-sample"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619418,"mean":4.9280690829525,"rank":815958,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2281353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619418,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92815,"mean":7.1689041523909,"rank":23564,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":68167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92815,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":633,"mean":2.5480443037975,"rank":116,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":633,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
