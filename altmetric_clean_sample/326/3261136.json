When glycerol is used as a substrate to produce 3-HP in E.\u00a0coli, only the ALDH pathway (employing aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) for conversion of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) into 3-HP) has been utilized as a synthetic pathway. However, several bacteria (including Klebsiella pneumoniae) are known to have the ability to produce 3-HP by the Pdu pathway (employing the PduP, PduL, and PduW enzymes). Here, we report the production of 3-HP in E.\u00a0coli by using the Pdu pathway from K.\u00a0pneumoniae as a synthetic pathway. Moreover, a strain harboring a dual synthetic pathways (ALDH and Pdu) exhibited a 70% increase in 3-HP titer compared to one harboring the ALDH pathway alone (56.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.736\u00a0mM and 33.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.920\u00a0mM, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report of 3-HP production by E.\u00a0coli harboring the Pdu pathway, with the dual synthetic pathway showing the highest yield ever reported by batch culture [54.1% (mol\/mol)].","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd2","doi":"10.1016\/j.jbiosc.2014.12.023","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T07:56:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["13891723"],"journal":"Journal of Bioscience & Bioengineering","last_mentioned_on":1422950202,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1389172314005039"],"pmid":"25650075","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Dual synthetic pathway for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production in engineered Escherichia coli ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dual-synthetic-pathway-3hydroxypropionic-acid-production-engineered-escherichia-coli"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710738,"mean":5.7106209852101,"rank":3156217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1369810,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710738,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164415,"mean":8.7809867772821,"rank":107288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":49776,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164415,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":343,"mean":1.8884093567251,"rank":162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":343,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":0.648,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
