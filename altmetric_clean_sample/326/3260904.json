Each cumulatively provided clue was assigned successively lower point-value, these points being risked whenever the subject responded. Patients with frontal-lobe excisions chose to make a guess after seeing only one clue more often than did a combined group of subjects without frontal-lobe damage, but this guessing-score was also related to extent of right temporal-lobe removal. Patients with left temporal-lobe or left frontal-lobe lesions had difficulty solving the verbal clues, occasionally failing to recognize that a response generated in the context of one clue satisfied all the clues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a5","authors":["L Miller","B Milner"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T07:41:36+00:00","issns":["0028-3932"],"issue":"3","journal":"Neuropsychologia","last_mentioned_on":1281705354,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/4022304"],"pmid":"4022304","pubdate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["psychology","neurology"],"title":"Cognitive risk-taking after frontal or temporal lobectomy--II.
