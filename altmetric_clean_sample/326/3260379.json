To prevent virus reactivation, a new VZV vaccine (Zostavax; Merck) that boosts cell-mediated immunity to VZV was developed. The 3-year Shingles Prevention Study showed that Zostavax significantly reduced burden of disease because of zoster and PHN. Despite its cost-effectiveness for adults aged 65-75 years, as determined in the United States, Canada and UK, <2% of immunocompetent adults over age 60 years in the United States were immunized in 2007. This was because of a combination of lack of patient awareness of the vaccine, physicians' uncertainty about the duration of protection and different cost-sharing plans for immunization. Nevertheless, zoster vaccine is safe, effective and highly recommended for immunization of immunocompetent individuals over age 60 years with no history of recent zoster.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ec3cf058f610005d5b","authors":["Gilden, D."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1365-2796.2011.02359.x","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T07:09:21+00:00","issns":["1365-2796"],"journal":"Journal of Internal Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1300083052,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1365-2796.2011.02359.x","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21294791","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3083261"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1365-2796.2011.02359.x\/pdf","pmid":"21294791","pubdate":"2011-02-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["internalmedicine"],"title":"Efficacy of live zoster vaccine in preventing zoster and postherpetic neuralgia","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-live-zoster-vaccine-preventing-zoster-postherpetic-neuralgia"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629910,"mean":4.9315517540573,"rank":816261,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2291033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629910,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94379,"mean":8.0802526436248,"rank":24479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68811,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94379,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":608,"mean":5.3186062602965,"rank":147,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":608,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.2642857142857,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
