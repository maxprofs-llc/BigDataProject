The sequence features of the cytosolic mandelate oxidase were summarized, and were used in the screening process. Mandelate oxidases from Streptomyces coelicolor (HmoSC) and Amycolatopsis orientalis (HmoAO) were screened and then they were heterologously expressed and characterized. At pH 7.3 40\u00b0C, the HmoAO showed kcat and Km values of 140min(-1) and 10.2mM, the HmoSC showed kcat and Km values of 105.1min(-1) and 2.06mM. The HmoSC was thermal stable and retained its 90% activity at 60\u00b0C for up to 5h, while HmoAO lost most of its activity at this temperature. The HmoSC could effectively catalyze the conversion of l-mandelate to phenylglyoxylate at higher temperature using oxygen as the final electron acceptor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027f2","authors":["Shuang Ping Liu","Rui Xia Liu","Liang Zhang","Gui Yang Shi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.enzmictec.2014.11.001","first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T11:38:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-0909"],"journal":"Enzyme & Microbial Technology","last_mentioned_on":1422963456,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25640721?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25640721","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","microbiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Sequence-based screening and characterization of cytosolic mandelate oxidase using oxygen as electron acceptor.","type":"article","volume":"69","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sequencebased-screening-characterization-cytosolic-mandelate-oxidase-using-oxygen-electron-acceptor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4710738,"mean":5.7106209852101,"rank":3945652,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4710738,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":164415,"mean":8.7809892101649,"rank":132275,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":164415,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201,"mean":1.45953,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.2777777777778,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Strep_papers\/status\/562575627895586816","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[3266076],"posted_on":"2015-02-03T11:37:36+00:00","author":{"name":"Strep_papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/513367728158044160\/4aRFryWr_normal.jpeg","description":"Twitterbot of #Streptomyces papers in #Pubmed\r\ncreated and curated by @paulhoskisson","id_on_source":"Strep_papers","tweeter_id":"2822299628","geo":{"lt":55.86515,"ln":-4.25763,"country":"GB"},"followers":329},"tweet_id":"562575627895586816"}]}}
