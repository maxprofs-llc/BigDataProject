The process of incorporation, based on an osmotic shock, has been tested on RBC of different species. Two dialysis protocols have been defined to transform RBC, the first one for small volumes in a cellulose bag and the other for larger volumes using a commercially available dialysis device. Different optimal conditions must be used for each species. Most of the cellular characteristics of the transformed RBC having encapsulated IHP are similar to those of native cells. For several species, such modified RBC could be reinfused and used for physiological studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023fb","authors":["C Bailleul","M C Borrelly-Villereal","M Chassaigne","C Ropars"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-03T15:08:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0885-4513"],"issue":"1","journal":"Biotechnology & Applied Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1314048636,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2706089"],"pmid":"2706089","pubdate":"1989-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biotechnology","biochemistry"],"title":"Modification of partial pressure of oxygen (P50) in mammalian red blood cells by incorporation of an allosteric effector of hemoglobin.","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/modification-partial-pressure-oxygen-p50-mammalian-red-blood-cells-incorporation-allosteric-effector"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629591,"mean":4.9337473984712,"rank":816392,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2290441,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629591,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94311,"mean":8.0724574912525,"rank":24441,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":68780,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94311,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282,"mean":0.64959430604982,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":263,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":0.7,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
