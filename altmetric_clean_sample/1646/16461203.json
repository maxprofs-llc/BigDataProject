These edible marine invertebrates are sources of potent bioactive peptides. The last two decades have seen a surge of interest in the discovery of antioxidant peptides from edible marine invertebrates. Enzymatic hydrolysis is an efficient strategy commonly used for releasing antioxidant peptides from food proteins. A growing number of antioxidant peptide sequences have been identified from the enzymatic hydrolysates of edible marine invertebrates. Antioxidant peptides have potential applications in food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. In this review, we first give a brief overview of the current state of progress of antioxidant peptide research, with special attention to marine antioxidant peptides. We then focus on 22 investigations which identified 32 antioxidant peptides from enzymatic hydrolysates of edible marine invertebrates. Strategies adopted by various research groups in the purification and identification of the antioxidant peptides will be summarized. Structural characteristic of the peptide sequences in relation to their antioxidant activities will be reviewed. Potential applications of the peptide sequences and future research prospects will also be discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f61000668a","authors":["Tsun-Thai Chai","Yew-Chye Law","Fai-Chu Wong","Se-Kwon Kim"],"doi":"10.3390\/md15020042","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T09:56:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1660-3397"],"issue":"2","journal":"Marine Drugs","last_mentioned_on":1489820410,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/2\/42?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/2\/42","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/md15020042"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/2\/42\/pdf","pmid":"28212329","pubdate":"2017-02-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["biology","pharmacology"],"title":"Enzyme-Assisted Discovery of Antioxidant Peptides from Edible Marine Invertebrates: A Review","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/1660-3397\/15\/2\/42","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enzymeassisted-discovery-antioxidant-peptides-edible-marine-invertebrates-review"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":2,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8380241,"mean":7.0622268827546,"rank":3641324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4618806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8380241,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":243454,"mean":13.69815745955,"rank":106806,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":132529,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":243454,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1079,"mean":3.4868423005566,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":691,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1079,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":2.6317073170732,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":69}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
