However, the depth information is lost due to integration of fluorescence signals along the propagation direction. We describe the design and implementation of two-photon lasers scanning stereomicroscopy, which allows viewing dynamic processes in three-dimensional (3D) space stereoscopically in real-time with shutter glasses at the speed of 1.4 volumes per second. The depth information can be appreciated by human visual system or be recovered with correspondence algorithms for some cases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Yanlong Yang","Baoli Yao","Ming Lei","Dan Dan","Runze Li","Mark Van Horn","Xun Chen","Yang Li","Tong Ye"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0168885","first_seen_on":"2017-02-16T10:56:07+00:00","funders":["nigms"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"12","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1490778453,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168885"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0168885&type=printable","pmcid":"PMC5173245","pmid":"27997624","pubdate":"2016-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0168885","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Two-Photon Laser Scanning Stereomicroscopy for Fast Volumetric Imaging","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0168885","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/twophoton-laser-scanning-stereomicroscopy-fast-volumetric-imaging"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.5,"score_history":{"1y":9.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":931167,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":7486822,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":244453,"mean":13.706419460671,"rank":43691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":200233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":244453,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116192,"mean":10.656067871006,"rank":19202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":96717,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116192,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4355,"mean":12.091865411116,"rank":795,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":3546,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4355,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
