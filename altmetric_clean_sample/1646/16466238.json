Subjects were divided into four groups according to the duration of breast feeding: \u22645, 6-11, 12-23, or \u226524 months groups. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MetS and its components were assessed according to the duration of breast feeding.\nWomen who breastfed for 6-11 months had an OR of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.86) for elevated blood pressure (BP) compared with those who breastfed for \u22645 months after adjustment for possible confounders in a multivariable logistic regression analyses. Women who breastfed for 12-23 months were associated with an OR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54-0.86) for elevated BP, an OR of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62-0.97) for elevated glucose, and an OR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.56-0.95) for MetS compared with those who breastfed for \u22645 months in a multivariable logistic regression analyses. Women who breastfed for \u226524 months had an OR of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.52-0.84) for elevated glucose, an OR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60-0.96) for elevated triglycerides, and an OR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53-0.92) for MetS compared with those who breastfed for \u22645 months in a multivariable logistic regression analyses.\nOur results suggest that lifelong breast feeding for \u226512 months may be associated with lower risk for MetS.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fa2","authors":["ChoiSe Rin","KimYong Min","ChoMin Su","KimSo Hyun","ShimYoung
