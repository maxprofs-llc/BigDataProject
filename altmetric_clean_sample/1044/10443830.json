Sensitivity analysis excluding these 6 patients demonstrated no change in study results or conclusion. Mean age was 67\u2009\u00b1\u20092 years and 56% were male. There were 36 patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery, and 21 patients had an open colon resection.\nExperimental arm received liposomal bupivacaine while control arm received standard bupivacaine.\nPrimary outcome measure was intravenous hydromorphone equivalent used via PCA during first 48 hours after operation.\nThere was no significant difference between the two groups in the amount of opioid used orally or intravenously in the postoperative period. The primary outcome measure was PCA hydromorphone consumption during first two postoperative days after operation (hydromorphone equivalent use in standard bupivacaine group 11.3\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9\u2009mg versus 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u200911.9\u2009mg in liposomal bupivacaine group, p = 0.58 Mann-Whitney test).\nSmall pragmatic trials typically remain underpowered for secondary analyses. A larger study could help to further delineate other outcomes that are impacted by postoperative pain.\nLiposomal bupivacaine did not change the amount of opioid used postoperatively. Based on our study, liposomal bupivacaine does not provide any added benefit over conventional bupivacaine after colon resection.
