Hence their 3D structures are expected to reveal these functions. Because experimental structures are scarce, predicted 3D structures are more adapted to OMP research instead, and the inter-barrel residue contact is becoming one of the most remarkable features, improving prediction accuracy by describing the structural information of OMPs. To predict OMP structures accurately, we explored an OMP inter-barrel residue contact prediction method: OMPcontact. Multiple OMP-specific features were integrated in the method, including residue evolutionary covariation, topology-based transmembrane segment relative residue position, OMP lipid layer accessibility, and residue evolution conservation. These features describe the properties of a residue pair in different respects: sequential, structural, evolutionary, and biochemical. Within a 3-residues slide window, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) could accurately determinate the inter-barrel contact residue pair using above features. A 5-fold cross-valuation process was applied in testing the OMPcontact performance against a non-redundant OMP set with 75 samples inside. The tests compared four evolutionary covariation methods and screen analyzed the adaptive ones for inter-barrel contact prediction. The results showed our method not only efficiently realized the prediction, but also scored the possibility for residue pairs reliably. This is expected to improve OMP tertiary structure prediction. Therefore, OMPcontact will be helpful in compiling a structural census of outer membrane protein.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d25","authors":["Zhang, Li","Wang, Han","Yan, Lun","Su, Lingtao","Xu, Dong","ZhangLi","WangHan","YanLun","SuLingtao","XuDong"],"doi":"10.1089\/cmb.2015.0236","first_seen_on":"2016-08-12T15:16:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1557-8666","1066-5277"],"journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","last_mentioned_on":1500249600,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27513917?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/cmb.2015.0236"],"pmid":"27513917","pubdate":"2016-08-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mathematical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Mathematics","Physical Sciences","Computer Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","computationalbiology"],"title":"OMPcontact: An Outer Membrane Protein Inter-Barrel Residue Contact Prediction Method","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ompcontact-outer-membrane-protein-interbarrel-residue-contact-prediction-method"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8219190,"mean":6.9624096623095,"rank":4132487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3877114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8219190,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257372,"mean":12.010718534722,"rank":129573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":117187,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257372,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":442,"mean":2.4313786848073,"rank":191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":442,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.5418947368421,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
