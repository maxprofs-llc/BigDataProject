In this study we aimed to address whether the AR coactivator nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1) is involved in PCa progression. Therefore, we tested the effect of long-term NCOA1 knockdown on processes relevant to metastasis formation. [3H]-thymidine incorporation assays revealed a reduced proliferation rate in AR-positive MDA PCa 2b and LNCaP cells upon knockdown of NCOA1, whereas AR-negative PC3 cells were not affected. Furthermore, Boyden chamber assays showed a strong decrease in migration and invasion upon NCOA1 knockdown, independently of the cell line\u00b4s AR status. In order to understand the mechanistic reasons for these changes, transcriptome analysis using cDNA microarrays was performed. Protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) was found to be prominently up-regulated by NCOA1 knockdown in MDA PCa 2b, but not in PC3 cells. Inhibition of PRKD1 reverted the reduced migratory potential caused by NCOA1 knockdown. Furthermore, PRKD1 was negatively regulated by AR. Immunohistochemical staining of PCa patient samples revealed a strong increase in NCOA1 expression in primary tumors compared to normal prostate tissue, while no final conclusion could be drawn for PRKD1 expression in tumor specimens. Thus, our findings directly associate the AR\/NCOA1 complex with PRKD1 regulation and cellular migration and support the concept of therapeutic inhibition of NCOA1 in PCa.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100027c4","authors":["Luef, Birgit","Handle, Florian","Kharaishvili, Gvantsa","Hager, Martina","Rainer, Johannes","Janetschek, G\u00fcnter","Hruby, Stephan","Englberger, Chrsitine","Bouchal, Jan","Santer, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric R","Culig, Zoran"],"doi":"10.1530\/erc-16-0160","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T13:01:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1479-6821","1351-0088"],"journal":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1465045271,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27255895"],"pmid":"27255895","pubdate":"2016-06-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"ERC-16-0160","subjects":["neoplasms","endocrinology"],"title":"The AR\/NCOA1 axis regulates prostate cancer migration by involvement of PRKD1","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/arncoa1-axis-regulates-prostate-cancer-migration-involvement-prkd1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":6800613,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269237,"mean":11.392471006849,"rank":224364,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269237,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":599,"mean":3.3202408026756,"rank":534,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":599,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":25,"mean":2.0208333333333,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":25,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
