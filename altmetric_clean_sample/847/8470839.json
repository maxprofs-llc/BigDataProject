The average age at the time of surgical intervention was 2.7months. Endoscopic surgical management was directed at laryngomalacia (70%), vallecular cysts (23.3%), and anterior glottic webs (6.7%). All patients had nearly immediate resolution of the stridor and feeding difficulties. None required revision surgery, modified diets, or alternative means of enteric nutrition.\nLaryngomalacia was the most commonly encountered surgical indication for stridulous newborns and infants with severe symptoms. Like most previous descriptions, patients responded well to supraglottoplasty. Vallecular cysts accounted for about one-quarter of the infants treated. Clinicians should carefully consider the presence of other airway pathology, which may mimic laryngomalacia, in non-syndromic infants without a previous history of intubation. Endoscopic surgical management may be safe and effective.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Cheng, Jeffrey","Smith, Lee P"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.amjoto.2015.05.009","endpage":"700","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T04:36:21+00:00","issns":["1532-818X","01960709"],"issue":"5","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1465014965,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26119081?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26119081","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"697","subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Endoscopic surgical management of inspiratory stridor in newborns and infants","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoscopic-surgical-management-inspiratory-stridor-newborns-infants"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":6800622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269232,"mean":11.392735881083,"rank":224358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269232,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":449,"mean":1.8054241071429,"rank":360,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":449,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":0.38235294117647,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Lecturer":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/OTO_docs\/statuses\/738952441748557824","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8470839],"posted_on":"2016-06-04T04:36:05+00:00","author":{"name":"OTOdocs","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/451475015045615617\/pvQ7oTD5_normal.jpeg","description":"Daily RSS feed for #Otolaryngology papers in #PubMed and #arXiv.","id_on_source":"OTO_docs","tweeter_id":"2424371810","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":385},"tweet_id":"738952441748557824"}]}}
