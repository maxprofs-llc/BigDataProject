It has been shown that the tpO(2) levels measured at the glans correlate with the penile blood flow. Our measurements were performed before, during and after cycling in an upright and a reclining position in a crossover study.\nThe mean transcutaneous pO(2) at the glans in a standing position before biking was 60.5+\/-8.1 mm Hg. It decreased after sitting on the saddle in an upright position to 17.9+\/-3.9 mm Hg. Continued cycling in a seated upright position showed pO(2) levels of 18.3+\/-5.2 mm Hg, with a full return to normal pO(2) values after a 10-min recovery period in a standing position. Cycling in a reclining position resulted in pO(2) levels of 59.4+\/-4.2 mm Hg, a similar level to that obtained before exercising.\nThe results of the present study demonstrated that there is a deficiency in penile perfusion caused by perineal arterial compression. Cycling in a reclining position - in which no perineal compression was seen - caused no alteration in penile blood flow during exercising. Therefore, we suggest cycling in a reclining position to avoid health hazards - such as penile numbness and hypoxygenation of the corpora cavernosa, which can result in impotency.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002875","authors":["Sommer, F","Schwarzer, U","Klotz, T","Caspers, H P","Haupt, G","Engelmann, U"],"doi":"52533","first_seen_on":"2016-06-04T09:58:18+00:00","issns":["0302-2838"],"issue":"6","journal":"European Urology","last_mentioned_on":1465031427,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11464064"],"pmid":"11464064","pubdate":"2001-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Erectile dysfunction in cyclists.
