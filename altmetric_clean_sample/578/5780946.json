In this study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of postoperative early Tc-99m pertechnetate scanning to detect remnant thyroid tissue and predict ablation success.\nDTC patients evaluated with postoperative Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy and treated with RAI between January 2007 and December 2014 were recruited. The results of Tc-99m pertechnetate scanning were compared with therapeutic I-131 whole-body scanning (TxWBS) and diagnostic I-131 whole-body scanning (DxWBS) performed 6-9 months after RAI.\nThere were 154 (21.5%) male and 563 (78.5%) female patients, with a mean age of 49.11\u00b112.35 years. Postoperative Tc-99m pertechnetate scanning was positive in 499 patients (69.6%) and negative in 218 (30.4%) patients. There were 673 (93.9%) patients with a positive TxWBS scan and 44 (6.1%) patients with negative TxWBS scan. Considering TxWBS as the standard test, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of Tc-99m pertechnetate scanning were 72.2, 70.5, 97.4, and 14.2%, respectively. DxWBS was positive in 57 (9.0%) and negative in 564 (91%) patients. Ablation dose was higher and preablation thyroglobulin was lower in patients with negative DxWBS (P=0.001 and 0.04, respectively). Overall, 171 (92.9%) of 184 patients with negative Tc-99m pertechnetate had negative DxWBS.\nPostoperative Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy has a high positive predictive value to detect remnant tissue in patients with DTC. Although negative Tc-99m pertechnetate scanning does not indicate removal of all thyroid tissue, it is related to successful ablation in more than 90% of patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62f3cf058f610008324","authors":["Ozdemir, Didem","Cuhaci, Fatma N","Ozdemir, Elif","Aydin, Cevdet","Ersoy, Reyhan","Turkolmez, Seyda","Cakir, Bekir","Cuhaci, Fatma N."],"doi":"10.1097\/mnm.0000000000000492","first_seen_on":"2016-02-20T14:41:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1473-5628","0143-3636"],"journal":"Nuclear Medicine Communications","last_mentioned_on":1456039798,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26895488?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/9000\/00000\/The_role_of_postoperative_Tc_99m_pertechnetate.98887.pdf?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26895488","pubdate":"2016-02-20T22:00:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nuclearmedicine"],"title":"The role of postoperative Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy in estimation of remnant mass and prediction of successful ablation in patients with di...  - PubMed - NCBI","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/nuclearmedicinecomm\/Fulltext\/publishahead\/The_role_of_postoperative_Tc_99m_pertechnetate.98887.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-postoperative-tc99m-pertechnetate-scintigraphy-estimation-remnant-mass-prediction-successful-ab"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7220962,"mean":6.3601386286362,"rank":3651494,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2051383,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7220962,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":283974,"mean":10.349234349744,"rank":152530,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":101720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":283974,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1157,"mean":1.465821799308,"rank":444,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":577,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1157,"percentile":49},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":1.5858695652174,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":3}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/usmolecular\/statuses\/701052089934303233","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5780946],"posted_on":"2016-02-20T14:33:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Tom","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1L7L","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/135034398\/atom_normal.bmp","description":"Molecular imaging and medicine tweets.","id_on_source":"usmolecular","tweeter_id":"30724493","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":24774},"tweet_id":"701052089934303233"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NMC_Journal\/statuses\/701307862740434945","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[5780946],"posted_on":"2016-02-21T07:29:58+00:00","author":{"name":"NuclearMedicineComms","url":"http:\/\/www.nuclearmedicinecomm.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2463248861\/NMC_cover_square_normal.jpg","description":"A monthly rapid communications journal journal publishing research in all areas of nuclear medicine.
