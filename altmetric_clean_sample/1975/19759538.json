We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the most recent clinical trials that evaluated elotuzumab and\/or daratumumab for the treatment of patients with RRMM. Our meta-analysis included 13 clinical trials with 2,402 patients participating. The overall response rate (ORR) was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38-76%), and the at least very good partial response rate (VGPR) was 32% (95% CI: 19-46%). mAb-based regimens prolonged progression-free survival (PFS, hazard ratio: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36-0.75) compared to non-mAb-based regimens. Additionally, the efficacy of triplet regimens was superior to that of single or doublet regimens. The same trend was observed in a subgroup analysis of daratumumab and elotuzumab. The most common grade 3\/4 adverse events included neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia, pneumonia, and fatigue. Elotuzumab and daratumumab improved the ORR, at least VGPR, and PFS compared to non-mAb-based regimens. In a pooled analysis, both mAbs had promising efficacy and safety profiles, particularly in triplet regimens. The same trend was observed in daratumumab- and elotuzumab-based regimens. Daratumumab triplet therapy (daratumumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) was superior to other triplet regimens for the treatment of RRMM, and daratumumab monotherapy was more effective than either single agent in heavily pretreated MM patients, suggesting CD38 is an effective target for treatment of RRMM. Additional clinical studies of elotuzumab and daratumumab will be required to validate these results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc6f","authors":["Tiantian Zhang","Sen Wang","Tengfei Lin","Jingmei Xie","Lina Zhao","Zhuoru Liang","Yangqiu Li","Jie Jiang"],"doi":"10.18632\/oncotarget.16987","first_seen_on":"2017-05-01T13:10:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1949-2553"],"journal":"Oncotarget","last_mentioned_on":1500561533,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28454113","http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=16987&path%5B%5D=54350#.WXC-0HAOgkQ.twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.impactjournals.com\/oncotarget\/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=download&path%5B%5D=16987&path%5B%5D=54349","pmid":"28454113","pubdate":"2017-05-01T22:07:16+00:00","publisher":"Impact Journals","subjects":["neoplasms"],"title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of novel monoclonal antibodies for treatment of relapsed\/refractory multiple myeloma","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-review-metaanalysis-efficacy-safety-novel-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-relapsedrefract"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8248040,"mean":6.9694059574582,"rank":4144814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":3892396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8248040,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242749,"mean":12.532856064725,"rank":122287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":110122,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242749,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8793,"mean":3.1483036851683,"rank":2213,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":6046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8793,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1292,"mean":2.806642912471,"rank":281,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":927,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1292,"percentile":71}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":7,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1,"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Myeloma_Doc\/statuses\/859032159235047425","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[19759538],"posted_on":"2017-05-01T13:10:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Robert Z.
