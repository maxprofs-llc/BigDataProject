Accordingly, they vary widely across species and underpin differences in ecological strategy. In this paper, VOCs spontaneously emitted by 109 plant species (belonging to 56 different families) have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in order to provide an alternative classification of plants species. In particular, by using bipartite networks methodology from Complex Network Theory, and through the application of community detection algorithms, we show that is possible to classify species according to chemical classes such as terpenes and sulfur compounds. Such complex network analysis allows to uncover hidden plants relationships related to their evolutionary and adaptation to the environment story.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Gianna Vivaldo","Elisa Masi","Cosimo Taiti","Guido Caldarelli","Stefano Mancuso"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-10975-x","first_seen_on":"2017-09-14T22:33:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1506205281,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28887468?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-10975-x"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-10975-x.pdf","pmid":"28887468","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"11050","subjects":["science"],"title":"The network of plants volatile organic compounds","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/beyond-network-plants-volatile-organic-compounds"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454129,"mean":7.1050519296527,"rank":6110930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2039522,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454129,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150035,"mean":11.896529906555,"rank":96842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":44369,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150035,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37797,"mean":14.756575246058,"rank":25240,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":10608,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37797,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2805,"mean":12.025883024251,"rank":1782,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":853,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2805,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Ph.
