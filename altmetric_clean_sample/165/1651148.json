Computational models must be assessed with accurate numerical methods on correctly scaled tissues to avoid numerical artifacts that can cloud analysis. Simulation-driven analyses can only be validated by careful experiments. In this perspectives piece, we evaluate a current, widespread model of matrix metalloproteinase-driven tissue degradation during cancer invasion to illustrate that integrative computational oncology may not realize its fullest potential if either of these critical steps is neglected.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa90f3cf058f61000cc4f","authors":["Shannon M.
