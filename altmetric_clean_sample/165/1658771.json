It inhibited the growth of Jurkat T-leukemia cells with an IC\u2085\u2080 of 1.9 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM whereas that of ASA was >5000 \u03bcM. It dose-dependently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells, causing a G\u2080\/G\u2081 cell cycle arrest. HS-ASA down-regulated \u03b2-catenin protein levels and reduced mRNA and protein expression of \u03b2-catenin\/TCF downstream target genes cyclinD1 and c-myc. Aspirin up to 5 mM had no effect on \u03b2-catenin expression. HS-ASA also increased caspase-3 protein levels and dose-dependently increased its activity. These effects were substantially blocked by z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4fa3cf058f610003009","authors":["Mitali Chattopadhyay","Niharika Nath","Ravinder Kodela","Tomasz Sobocki","Shalaka Metkar","Zong Yuan Gan","Khosrow Kashfi"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.leukres.2013.07.004","first_seen_on":"2013-07-30T16:03:01+00:00","issns":["01452126"],"journal":"Leukemia Research","last_mentioned_on":1375606292,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0145212613002312"],"pmid":"23896061","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin inhibits the growth of leukemic Jurkat cells and modulates \u03b2-catenin expression","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nodonating-aspirin-inhibits-growth-leukemic-jurkat-cells-modulates-catenin-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628371,"mean":4.9417862081361,"rank":1725453,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1838068,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628371,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85609,"mean":7.4531291000842,"rank":35997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":47748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85609,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":320,"mean":1.493987460815,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":320,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.1894736842105,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":75}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
