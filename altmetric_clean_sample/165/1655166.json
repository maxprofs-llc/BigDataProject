Because transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4) is functionally expressed by many cell types in the cardiovascular system and is involved in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases, we decided to assess its suitability as a target of therapy. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the possible cardioprotective effect of 9-phenanthrol, a specific inhibitor of TRPM4. Isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were pretreated with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution (control), 9-phenanthrol, or 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, a blocker of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel) and then subjected to global ischemia followed by reperfusion with the K-H solution. To evaluate the extent of heart damage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the effluent solution was measured, and the size of infarcted area of the heart was measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In controls, cardiac contractility decreased, and LDH activity and the infarcted area size increased. In contrast, in hearts pretreated with 9-phenanthrol, contractile function recovered dramatically, and the infarcted area size significantly decreased. The cardioprotective effects of 9-phenanthrol was not completely blocked by 5-HD. These findings show that 9-phenanthrol exerts a cardioprotective effect against ischemia in the isolated rat heart and suggest that its mechanism of action is largely independent of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Jing Wang","Ken Takahashi","Hulin Piao","Peng Qu","Keiji Naruse"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0070587","first_seen_on":"2013-07-29T02:52:29+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1375066335,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0070587"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0070587.pdf","pmid":"23936231","pubdate":"2013-07-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e70587","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"9-Phenanthrol, a TRPM4 Inhibitor, Protects Isolated Rat Hearts from Ischemia\u2013Reperfusion Injury","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/9phenanthrol-trpm4-inhibitor-protects-isolated-rat-hearts-ischemiareperfusion-injury"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3635018,"mean":4.9199431259457,"rank":2900337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3635018,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85875,"mean":7.4035032722362,"rank":68272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":355,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85875,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":64130,"mean":8.2574613357452,"rank":50263,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":290,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":64130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3662,"mean":11.486160065556,"rank":3023,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3662,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
