Building upon the existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the spread of these infections.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Yuen WW","Wong WC","Tang CS","Holroyd E","Tiwari AF","Fong DY","Chin WY","Winnie Wing-Yan Yuen","William Chi-Wai Wong","Catherine So-Kum Tang","Eleanor Holroyd","Agnes Fung-Yee Tiwari","Daniel Yee-Tak Fong","Weng Yee Chin"],"doi":"10.1186\/1471-2458-13-683","first_seen_on":"2013-07-29T15:28:57+00:00","issns":["1471-2458",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1378085407,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/13\/683\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1471-2458-13-683.pdf","pmid":"23886280","pubdate":"2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"683","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of personal resilience and enrichment programme (PREP) for HIV prevention among female sex workers: a randomised controlled trial","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1471-2458-13-683","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluating-effectiveness-personal-resilience-enrichment-programme-prep-hiv-prevention-among-female-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5163299,"mean":6.0994513243304,"rank":2215949,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2877567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5163299,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96230,"mean":7.716018435191,"rank":36268,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":58460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96230,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5587,"mean":6.6986906552094,"rank":3220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":41,"this_scored_higher_than":2298,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5587,"percentile":41},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":163,"mean":7.8629382716049,"rank":108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":55,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":163,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
