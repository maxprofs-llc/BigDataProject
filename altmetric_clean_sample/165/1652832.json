In cases of edentulous candidates for the conservative treatment of facial fractures, none of the conventional methods can be instituted for maxillomandibular fixation. Fixation in such cases is achieved with the aid of the total dentures of the patient or the confection of splints, but these methods lead to eating and oral hygiene problems. This article reports the case of an edentulous patient with a comminuted mandible fracture treated with a rarely described technique in which intermaxillary fixation was achieved with titanium miniplates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007c24","doi":"10.1097\/scs.0b013e31824e2528","first_seen_on":"2013-07-27T00:42:11+00:00","issns":["1049-2275"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Craniofacial Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1374885714,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/Abstract\/2012\/05000\/Conservative_Treatment_of_Comminuted_Mandibular.67.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/jcraniofacialsurgery\/2012\/05000\/Conservative_Treatment_of_Comminuted_Mandibular.67.pdf","pmid":"22565920","pubdate":"2012-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"893","subjects":["dentistry","generalsurgery"],"title":"Conservative Treatment of Comminuted Mandibular Fracture Involving Maxillomandibular Fixation With Miniplates","type":"article","volume":"23","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/conservative-treatment-comminuted-mandibular-fracture-involving-maxillomandibular-fixation-miniplate"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3560630,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":137320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":90712,"mean":7.5818435250412,"rank":73258,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":642,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":90712,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2563,"mean":0.73940046838408,"rank":1050,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2563,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157,"mean":1.2198717948718,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
