These events are primarily mediated via NF \u03ba B. On the short-term scale postprandial inflammation is characterized by an increase in circulating levels of IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1 and is mirrored on the long-term by proinflammatory gene expression changes in the adipocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of obese individuals. Specifically the upregulation of CCL2\/MCP-1, CCL3\/MIP-1 \u03b1 , CCL4\/MIP-1 \u03b2 , CXCL2\/MIP-2 \u03b1 , and CXCL3\/MIP-2 \u03b2 is noted because these changes have been observed in both adipocytes and PBMC of obese humans. In comparing numerous human intervention studies it is clear that pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory consumption choices mediate gene expression in humans adipocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Arachidonic acid and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) both demonstrate an ability to increase pro-inflammatory IL-8 along with numerous other inflammatory factors including IL-6, TNF \u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 , and CXCL1 for arachidonic acid and IGB2 and CTSS for SFA. Antioxidant rich foods including olive oil, fruits, and vegetables all demonstrate an ability to lower levels of IL-6 in PBMCs. Thus, dietary choices play a complex role in the mediation of unavoidable oxidative stress and can serve to exacerbate or dampen the level of inflammation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6313cf058f610008425","authors":["Mu&#xf1;oz, Alexandra"],"doi":"10.1155\/2013\/610950","first_seen_on":"2013-07-29T23:53:51+00:00","issns":["1942-0900"],"journal":"Oxidative Medicine & Cellular Longetivity","last_mentioned_on":1375142009,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/oximed\/2013\/610950\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/oximed\/2013\/610950.pdf","pmid":"23844276","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","subjects":["metabolism","cellbiology"],"title":"Nutritionally Mediated Oxidative Stress and Inflammation","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nutritionally-mediated-oxidative-stress-inflammation-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628675,"mean":4.9393923648184,"rank":2016778,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937274,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628675,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85715,"mean":7.4434402781344,"rank":44684,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":23023,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85715,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":276,"mean":2.7962109090909,"rank":129,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":98,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":276,"percentile":35},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.5607142857143,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
