The underlying perceptual problem of the listening difficulties in unfavorable listening conditions is unknown. The objective of this article was to demonstrate theoretically how to determine whether the speech recognition problems are related to an auditory dysfunction, a language-based dysfunction, or a combination of both.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ed","doi":"10.1044\/1059-0889(2010\/09-0022)","first_seen_on":"2013-07-28T18:28:47+00:00","issns":["1059-0889"],"journal":"American Journal of Audiology","last_mentioned_on":1375035557,"links":["http:\/\/aja.asha.org\/cgi\/content\/short\/19\/1\/17?rss=1&ssource=mfr&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/aja.asha.org\/cgi\/reprint\/19\/1\/17.pdf","pmid":"20308289","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"ASHA","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology"],"title":"Auditory Processing Disorder and Speech Perception Problems in Noise: Finding the Underlying Origin","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/auditory-processing-disorder-speech-perception-problems-noise-finding-underlying-origin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6229412,"mean":5.9660401858233,"rank":4606917,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935380,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6229412,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":101213,"mean":7.7002270876972,"rank":68352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":17137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":101213,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269,"mean":5.9444402985075,"rank":221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":4.2666666666667,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
