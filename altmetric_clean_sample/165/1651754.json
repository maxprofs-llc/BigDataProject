Low oxidation and thermal stability, poor low-temperature properties and a narrow range of available viscosities, however, limit their potential application as industrial lubricants. The inherent problems of plant oils can be improved by attaching functional groups at the sites of unsaturation through chemical modifications. In this article, we will demonstrate how functionalization helps overcome these disadvantages.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007f6","authors":["Nadia Salih","Jumat Salimon","Emad Yousif","Bashar Mudhaffar Abdullah"],"doi":"10.1186\/1752-153x-7-128","first_seen_on":"2013-07-26T14:27:59+00:00","issns":["1752-153X"],"journal":"Chemistry Central Journal","last_mentioned_on":1374846673,"links":["http:\/\/journal.chemistrycentral.com\/content\/7\/1\/128\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.chemistrycentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1752-153X-7-128.pdf","pmid":"23885790","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Chemistry Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Biolubricant basestocks from chemically modified plant oils: ricinoleic acid based-tetraesters","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/biolubricant-basestocks-chemically-modified-plant-oils-ricinoleic-acid-based-tetraesters-biolubrican-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228993,"mean":5.9654070340771,"rank":4606516,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":935357,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228993,"percentile":15},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100662,"mean":7.7056605835429,"rank":68004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":17008,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100662,"percentile":16},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":494,"mean":2.9489614604462,"rank":266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":4,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":494,"percentile":4},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.4656,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Environmental Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Chem_Central\/status\/360759211069685760","license":"public","citation_ids":[1651754],"posted_on":"2013-07-26T13:51:13+00:00","author":{"name":"Springer Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/chemistry","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/661116376782938112\/lEkOQWeO_normal.jpg","description":"Tweeting content, news and updates from all of Springer\u2019s chemistry portfolio.
