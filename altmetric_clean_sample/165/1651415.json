Previous studies have shown increased ROS after lengthening contractions, attributable to invading phagocytes. Plasma glucose is a vital fuel for phagocytes, therefore carbohydrate (CHO) status before exercise may influence ROS production and DOMS.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002456","authors":["G Close","T Ashton","T Cable","D Doran","C Noyes","F McArdle","D MacLaren","Close GL","Ashton T","Cable T","Doran D","Noyes C","McArdle F","MacLaren DP"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjsm.2005.019844","endpage":"953","first_seen_on":"2013-07-26T13:02:44+00:00","issns":["0306-3674"],"issue":"12","journal":"British Journal of Sports Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1433048269,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1725093\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16306505"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1725093\/pdf\/v039p00948.pdf","pmcid":"PMC1725093","pmid":"16306505","pubdate":"2005-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"startpage":"948","subjects":["sportsmedicine"],"title":"Effects of dietary carbohydrate on delayed onset muscle soreness and reactive oxygen species after contraction induced muscle damage.","type":"article","volume":"39","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-dietary-carbohydrate-delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-reactive-oxygen-species-after-contraction-7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5168589,"mean":6.1023121711407,"rank":1957584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":3193264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5168589,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":96081,"mean":7.7220214820982,"rank":30594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":96081,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3207,"mean":24.520383031815,"rank":2106,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":1094,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3207,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":150,"mean":21.217543624161,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":150,"percentile":32}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
