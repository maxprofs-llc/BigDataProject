These are factors most often provoked by the unusually large curriculum, nature of the course, and the psychosocial impact of dissection. As a palliative measure, Anatomy Adventure, a board game on anatomy was designed to reduce some of these pressures, emphasize student centered and collaborative learning styles, and add fun to the process of learning while promoting understanding and retention of the subject. To assess these objectives, 95 out of over 150 medical and dental students who expressed willingness to be part of the study were recruited and divided into a Game group and a Non-game group. A pretest written examination was given to both groups, participants in the Game group were allowed to play the game for ten days, after which a post-test examination was also given. A 20-item questionnaire rated on a three-point scale to access student's perception of the game was given to the game group. The post-test scores of the game group were significantly higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than those of the non-game counterparts. Also the post-test score of the game based group was significantly better (P\u2009<\u20090.05) than their pretest. The students in their feedback noted in very high proportions that the game was interesting, highly informative, encouraged team work, improved their attitude, and perception to gross anatomy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069c5","authors":["Anyanwu EG","Anyanwu, Emeka G."],"doi":"10.1002\/ase.1389","endpage":"160","first_seen_on":"2013-07-30T13:22:55+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1935-9780","1935-9772"],"issue":"2","journal":"Anatomical Sciences Education","last_mentioned_on":1435660955,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ase.1389\/abstract;jsessionid=9AB5F57D14583EFF375BAD0B85485E70.d01t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ase.1389\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23878076"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/ase.1389\/pdf","pmid":"23878076","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Curriculum And Pedagogy","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Specialist Studies In Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"153","subjects":["education","anatomy"],"title":"Anatomy adventure: A board game for enhancing understanding of anatomy.","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anatomy-adventure-board-game-enhancing-understanding-anatomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7393253,"mean":6.4240249551848,"rank":2846775,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4524377,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7393253,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124262,"mean":6.8511523004001,"rank":37015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":86755,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124262,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":319,"mean":3.6564905660377,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":319,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":7.2375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":40}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
