Patients with EDS type III have a bleeding tendency manifested by ecchymoses and haematomas. However, thrombotic events are rare in this entity. Herein, we present a 48-year-old Hispanic man with EDS type III who had recurrent cephalic vein thrombophlebitis and thrombosis, and brachial vein thrombosis. Tests for hypercoagulable disorders including antithrombin III activity, protein C activity, protein S activity, anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine levels, factor V Leiden mutation and prothrombin gene mutation were negative. The patient required long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. After 3 years follow-up, he did not present further thrombotic events. Clinicians should be aware that patients with EDS might be at risk for hypercoagulable disorders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc98","authors":["Jim\u00e9nez-Encarnaci\u00f3n E","Vil\u00e1 LM"],"doi":"10.1136\/bcr-2013-008922","first_seen_on":"2013-07-29T15:52:43+00:00","issns":["1757-790X"],"issue":"","journal":"BMJ Case Reports","last_mentioned_on":1435532142,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23814193","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/23814193\/","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bcr-2013-008922","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3702833\/"],"pmid":"23814193","pubdate":"2013-07-04T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Case Report: Recurrent venous thrombosis in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III: an atypical manifestation","type":"article","volume":"2013","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recurrent-venous-thrombosis-ehlersdanlos-syndrome-type-iii-atypical-manifestation-3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575269,"mean":6.0981511691996,"rank":1288374,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":5278897,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575269,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103745,"mean":7.6406489242752,"rank":24040,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":79544,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103745,"percentile":76},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2739,"mean":4.1716040905771,"rank":452,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":2284,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2739,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100,"mean":2.6657575757576,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":85,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":5}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/EDS_news\/status\/431945684317528065","license":"public","citation_ids":[1656158],"posted_on":"2014-02-08T00:20:50+00:00","author":{"name":"EDS_news","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/slCIuZrysw","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/425383014688776192\/XyzuD5Xo_normal.png","description":"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Scientific News","id_on_source":"EDS_news","tweeter_id":"2216550810","followers":6},"tweet_id":"431945684317528065"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CatherinBrunton\/statuses\/361883971845500929","license":"public","rt":["LilacZebra"],"citation_ids":[1656158],"posted_on":"2013-07-29T16:20:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Catherine Brunton","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1724592095\/4399fa62-0bbc-4df5-a405-a4cdb80c3af9_normal.png","description":"Sci-Fi Geek working in the City.
