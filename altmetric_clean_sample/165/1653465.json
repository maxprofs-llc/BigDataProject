Type I lesions present at birth and are derived from ectopic arachnoid cells. Type II lesions usually present in adults and are derived from arachnoid cells surrounding nerve bundles. Type III lesions are due to direct extension or metastasis from dural-based neoplasms. Dural-based meningiomas are known to express p63. The aim of our study is to examine the expression of p63 in type II and type III meningioma. Two cases of cutaneous meningioma (type II and type III) were evaluated for the expression of p63, EMA, CK 5\/6, S100 and CD31. The cells of interest were spindled to epithelioid and arranged in a whorling pattern. Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of EMA and p63 in both cases, while stains for CK 5\/6, S100 and CD31 were negative. Among cutaneous tumors, p63 is considered a marker of epithelial derivation, as it is positive in epidermal and adnexal neoplasms. It is important to be aware of p63 expression in the context of cutaneous meningioma to avoid misinterpretation as an epithelial tumor. On the basis of our small study, it is unlikely that p63 expression would be helpful in distinguishing between type II and type III meningioma, as both may be p63-positive.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d48","authors":["Fox, MD","Billings, SD","Gleason, BC","Thomas, AB","Cibull, TL"],"doi":"10.1111\/cup.12198","endpage":"n\/a","first_seen_on":"2013-07-27T15:25:08+00:00","issns":["1600-0560","0303-6987"],"journal":"Journal of Cutaneous Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1374939974,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cup.12198\/abstract;jsessionid=BC1EC7A932BC14F9BE9438F26FF42657.d01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/cup.12198\/pdf","pmid":"23924346","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"n\/a","subjects":["pathology","dermatology"],"title":"Cutaneous Meningioma: A Potential Diagnostic Pitfall in p63 Positive Cutaneous Neoplasms","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cutaneous-meningioma-potential-diagnostic-pitfall-p63-positive-cutaneous-neoplasms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6712167,"mean":6.1609586696736,"rank":3195814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":3491209,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6712167,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":122410,"mean":6.7448807522324,"rank":54584,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":67184,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":122410,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":456,"mean":2.6535208791209,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":258,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":456,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":1.0625,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Student  > Ph.
