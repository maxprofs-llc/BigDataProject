The bimolecular probes consist of a lanthanide complex with open coordination sites and a reactive pre-antenna composed of an aromatic acid or amide; the latter binds to and sensitizes terbium emission upon hydroxylation by HO\u2022. These probes exhibit long luminescence lifetimes compatible with time-delayed measurements that remove interfering background fluorescence from the sample. Six different reactive pre-antenna (benzoate, benzamide, isophthalate, isophthalamide, trimesate, and trimesamide) and two different terbium complexes [Tb-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-tris(acetic acid)) (Tb-DO3A) and Tb-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-bis(acetic acid)) (Tb-DO2A)] were evaluated. Of these the trimesamide\/Tb-DO3A system enables the most sensitive detection of HO\u2022 with an about 1000-fold increase in metal-centered time-delayed emission upon hydroxylation of the pre-antenna to 2-hydroxytrimesamide. Excellent selectivity for both the trimesamide\/Tb-DO3A and trimesate\/Tb-DO3A systems over other reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are observed. Notably, the increase in metal-centered luminescence intensity is not associated with a decrease in the hydration number (q) of Tb-DO3A, suggesting that the antenna is interacting with the lanthanide via a second sphere coordination environment or that coordination by the antenna occurs by displacement of one or more of the carboxylate arms of DO3A. Formation of a weak ternary complex Tb-DO3A\u2022hydroxytrimesamide was confirmed by temperature-dependent titration and a decrease in K(app) with increasing temperature.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Katie L.
