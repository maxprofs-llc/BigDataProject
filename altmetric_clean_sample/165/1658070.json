However, in the literature far less emphasis is placed upon the safety of the surgeon and his\/her team. This review discusses the risks to which a surgeon is exposed, including blood-borne pathogens, radiation exposure, biomechanical stresses and fatigue, and the adverse effects of diathermy fumes. Strategies addressing these risks are presented and recommendations to improve surgical team safety are offered.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61e3cf058f6100079f1","authors":["Khajuria A","Maruthappu M","Nagendran M","Shalhoub J"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijsu.2012.11.024","first_seen_on":"2013-07-30T09:18:50+00:00","issns":["1743-9191"],"issue":"","journal":"International Journal of Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1375175923,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23246870"],"pmid":"23246870","pubdate":"2012-12-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"What about the surgeon?","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/about-surgeon-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634915,"mean":4.919334042571,"rank":2898831,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634915,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85772,"mean":7.4098249058541,"rank":68143,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85772,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":268,"mean":1.9816928838951,"rank":161,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":268,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.445,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
