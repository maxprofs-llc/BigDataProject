Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with ketamine combined with droperidol and fentanyl (DFK) has been used in 14 schizophrenic patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Two patients died post-operatively of concomitant severe disease rather than from schizophrenia related pathophysiology or anaesthetic complication. One patient showed transient mild anxiety in the early post-operative period soon relieved by the patient's routine medication. However, no patient developed exacerbations of psychosis or psychological emergence reactions during the first post-operative month. The cardiovascular state during and after DFK remained stable in all cases. It is concluded that ketamine when combined with droperidol and fentanyl is a satisfactory anaesthetic for patients with schizophrenia.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f61000733a","authors":["Ishihara, H","Kudo, H","Murakawa, T","Kudo, A","Takahashi, S","Matsuki, A"],"first_seen_on":"2013-07-31T02:23:10+00:00","issns":["0265-0215"],"issue":"1","journal":"European Journal of Anaesthesiology","last_mentioned_on":1489262618,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9049558","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9049558"],"pmid":"9049558","pubdate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Hirosaki School of Medicine, Hirosaki-Shi, 036 Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["anesthesiology"],"title":"Uneventful total intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine for schizophrenic surgical patients.","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/uneventful-total-intravenous-anaesthesia-ketamine-schizophrenic-surgical-patients"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":1195272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7139370,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":128391,"mean":7.1038695381262,"rank":19156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":109092,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":128391,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":999,"mean":2.5008456913828,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":999,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":3.09,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Professor":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"PHARM Podcast 77  Ketamine MythBusters Part 3 \u2013 Are you mad enough?","url":"http:\/\/prehospitalmed.com\/2013\/07\/31\/pharm-podcast-77-ketamine-mythbusters-part-3-are-you-mad-enough\/","citation_ids":[1659913,1219828,1659914,1659915],"posted_on":"2013-07-31T00:22:00+00:00","summary":"A little bit of this and a little bit of that..\n\nTonight on the podcast , we bust another long term medical myth.
