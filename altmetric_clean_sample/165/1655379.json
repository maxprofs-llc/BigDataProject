Here, we measured serum levels of soluble forms of Fas (sFas), Fas ligand (sFasL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) in 38 healthy controls (HC) and 92 untreated MS patients with different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease by immunoassay. Serum levels of sFas, sFasL and sTRAIL did not differ between MS patients and HC. sTRAIL levels were significantly decreased in RRMS during relapses. These findings support a role of TRAIL in the pathogenesis of MS, especially during the acute phases of the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e75","authors":["Montserrat Moreno","Mat\u00edas S\u00e1enz-Cuesta","Joaqu\u00edn Castill\u00f3","Ester Cant\u00f3","Laura Negrotto","Anka Vidal","Xavier Montalban","Manuel Comabella"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jneuroim.2013.07.013","first_seen_on":"2013-07-29T09:08:26+00:00","issns":["01655728"],"journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","last_mentioned_on":1375106099,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0165572813001975"],"pmid":"23932896","pubdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Neuroscience"],"title":"Circulating levels of soluble apoptosis related molecules in patients with multiple sclerosis","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/circulating-levels-soluble-apoptosisrelated-molecules-patients-multiple-sclerosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6575269,"mean":6.0981511691996,"rank":2545191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3951488,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6575269,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103744,"mean":7.6407124528885,"rank":39035,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":63101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103744,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":2.741499364676,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":5.8771764705882,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
