The protocol gives reproducible results and can be carried out quickly in 2\u00a0hours. Tissue extracts clarified with filtration were treated with non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100) to lyse membranes of contaminating organelles. Nuclei were collected from a 60% Percoll layer of density gradient following low-speed centrifugation. Western blot analysis using antibodies to marker proteins of organelles indicated that the nuclear protein fractions were highly enriched and free or nearly free of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and chloroplasts.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f61000088b","doi":"10.1186\/1746-4811-9-31","first_seen_on":"2013-07-27T22:00:51+00:00","issns":["1746-4811"],"issue":"1","journal":"Plant Methods","last_mentioned_on":1375973377,"links":["http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/9\/1\/31\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.plantmethods.com\/content\/pdf\/1746-4811-9-31.pdf","pmid":"23886449","pubdate":"2013-07-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Plant Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"31","title":"Protocol: Optimised methodology for isolation of nuclei from leaves of species in the Solanaceae and Rosaceae families","type":"article","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/protocol-optimised-methodology-isolation-nuclei-leaves-species-solanaceae-rosaceae-families"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6232855,"mean":5.9627156798492,"rank":2045742,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":4160644,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6232855,"percentile":66},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100908,"mean":7.7016357834442,"rank":30814,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":69452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100908,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":212,"mean":5.1938483412322,"rank":80,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":130,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":212,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":12.477666666667,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":46}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":33,"Student  > Doctoral Student":6,"Student  > Ph.
