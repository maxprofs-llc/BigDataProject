Prediction equations based on BIA applicable to preschool children are available but are based on total body water estimation and have not been developed across multiple ethnic groups. Our aim was to develop a BIA-based equation in a multi-ethnic sample of 2-year old using fat-free mass (FFM) from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as criterion measure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002829","authors":["Rush EC","Bristow S","Plank LD","Rowan J","E C Rush","S Bristow","L D Plank","J Rowan"],"doi":"10.1038\/ejcn.2012.182","endpage":"217","first_seen_on":"2013-07-26T10:04:42+00:00","issns":["0954-3007","1476-5640"],"issue":"2","journal":"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1374833077,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23232588?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23232588","pubdate":"2012-12-14T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"startpage":"214","subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Bioimpedance prediction of fat-free mass from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in a multi-ethnic group of 2-year-old children.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ejcn.2012.182","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bioimpedance-prediction-fatfree-mass-dualenergy-xray-absorptiometry-multiethnic-group-2yearold-child"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7160613,"mean":6.3093260978221,"rank":5382210,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":992605,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7160613,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":123746,"mean":6.7906807871026,"rank":78994,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":23143,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":123746,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1955,"mean":11.962761514841,"rank":1703,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1955,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":25.0767,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
