This study was primarily descriptive and utilized a mixed method design including collection of quantitative and qualitative data.\n242 patients responded (24\u00a0% response rate); 32.4\u00a0% overweight (N\u00a0=\u00a072), 41.9\u00a0% obese (N\u00a0=\u00a093). 47\u00a0% of overweight and 71\u00a0% of obese patients recalled that their provider discussed weight; 92\u00a0% were motivated to follow recommendations and 89\u00a0% felt confident doing so. Most patients (75\u00a0%) would like their provider to be \"very direct\/straightforward\" when discussing weight, and 52\u00a0% would be \"not at all offended\" if they were diagnosed as \"overweight\/obese.\" Most patients (63\u00a0%) reported being \"extremely comfortable\" discussing weight with providers. Patients with higher BMI had higher levels of internalized weight bias (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and wanted their provider to \"discuss weight sensitively\" (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05).\nThis study suggests that patients have important preferences that providers should be mindful of when discussing weight. While these discussions can be challenging, most patients report that they would be comfortable having these conversations directly and most would have enhanced motivation and confidence following these conversations. Communicating about weight is needed and desired by patients; doing so sensitively with those at higher weight is essential.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6153cf058f6100071b4","authors":["Koball, Afton M","Mueller, Paul S","Craner, Julia","Clark, Matthew M","Nanda, Sanjeev","Kebede, Esayas B","Grothe, Karen B"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40519-016-0304-6","first_seen_on":"2016-08-02T08:40:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1590-1262"],"journal":"Eating and Weight Disorders: Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity","last_mentioned_on":1470127168,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27473870"],"pmid":"27473870","pubdate":"2016-08-02T22:12:06+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Psychiatry","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["metabolism","gastroenterology"],"title":"Crucial conversations about weight management with healthcare providers: patients' perspectives and experiences.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/crucial-conversations-about-weight-management-healthcare-providers-patients-perspectives-experiences-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":6194045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1096713,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257721,"mean":11.996981724352,"rank":182892,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257721,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":354,"mean":6.4237393767705,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":49,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":354,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":2.76875,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/NE_ObesityForum\/statuses\/760394575441719297","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10201220],"posted_on":"2016-08-02T08:39:28+00:00","author":{"name":"NE Obesity Forum","url":"http:\/\/www.aso.org.uk\/association\/north-east\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/882535827166855169\/koKcvEKf_normal.jpg","description":"The North East Obesity Forum promoting engagement between NE groups with an interest in obesity and its health & social consequences, regional @UK_ASO affiliate","id_on_source":"NE_ObesityForum","tweeter_id":"3588116537","geo":{"lt":54.94452,"ln":-1.42815,"country":"GB"},"followers":498},"tweet_id":"760394575441719297"}]}}
