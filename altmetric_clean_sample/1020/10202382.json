One example of such a pattern is the tendency of neurons to fire packets of action potentials (i.e., a burst) followed by quiescence. While it is well known that multiple mechanisms can generate bursts of action potentials at both the single-neuron and the network level, the functional role of burst firing in sensory processing is not so well understood to date. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the known mechanisms and functions of burst firing in processing of electrosensory stimuli in gymnotiform weakly electric fish. We also present new evidence from existing data showing that bursts and isolated spikes provide distinct information about stimulus variance. It is likely that these functional roles will be generally applicable to other systems and species.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc0b","authors":["Metzen, Michael G.","Krahe, R\u00fcdiger","Chacron, Maurice J."],"doi":"10.3389\/fncom.2016.00081","first_seen_on":"2016-08-02T09:09:18+00:00","funders":["niehs","cihr"],"issns":["1662-5188"],"journal":"Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience","last_mentioned_on":1470130930,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncom.2016.00081\/full?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncom.2016.00081\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fncom.2016.00081\/pdf","pmid":"27531978","pubdate":"2016-08-02T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Burst Firing in the Electrosensory System of Gymnotiform Weakly Electric Fish: Mechanisms and Functional Roles","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/burst-firing-electrosensory-system-gymnotiform-weakly-electric-fish-mechanisms-functional-roles"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":6194046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1096710,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":257721,"mean":11.996961353406,"rank":182888,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":40000,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":257721,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":690,"mean":5.8996923076923,"rank":535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":90,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":690,"percentile":13},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":9.9796315789474,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
