Macroscopic and histological analyses of alveolar bone were performed, together with measurement of oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters in gums and submandibular glands (SMG).\nHCC induced cortical alveolar bone loss, decreased interradicular bone volume and increased the periodontal ligament height compared to control rats (p<0.05). CCH enhanced iNOS activity in gums (from 2735,04\u00b1662,96 nmol\/min\/mg proteins to 4289,58\u00b1915,63 p<0.05) and in SMG (from 56,71\u00b112,05 nmol\/min\/mg proteins to 90,15\u00b121,78 p<0.05). PGE2 did not change in gums or in SMG by means of CCH, while TNF\u03b1 decreased in gums (p<0.05). Regarding oxidative stress, thiobarbituric acid reactive species concentration in CCH animals was higher both in gums as in SMG, and catalase activity was decreased in SMG.\nHigher iNOS activity both in gums and SMG under CCH could be associated with the alveolar bone loss observed. The increase in oxidative stress occurring in SMG and gums, together with a lower antioxidant capacity might indicate a deleterious effect of HX in oral health.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000230a","authors":["Terrizzi, Antonela R","Fernandez-Solari, Javier","Lee, Ching M","Conti, Mar\u00eda Ines","Mart\u00ednez, Mar\u00eda Pilar"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.archoralbio.2016.08.006","endpage":"7","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T07:27:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1879-1506","00039969"],"journal":"Archives of Oral Biology","last_mentioned_on":1471418829,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27521733?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27521733","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Dentistry","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["dentistry"],"title":"Deleterious effect of chronic continuous hypoxia on oral health","type":"article","volume":"72","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/deleterious-effect-chronic-continuous-hypoxia-oral-health"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":7121716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252986,"mean":12.238686807518,"rank":214099,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252986,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":590,"mean":2.4854295415959,"rank":402,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":590,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":2.419,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
