A variety of differently substituted dienes were tolerated very well, affording cyclic ketones with two consecutive stereogenic centers (including one quaternary carbon) in moderate to high yields and with high to excellent enantioselectivities. This work expanded both reaction types of catalytic diene desymmetrizations and substrate diversity in NHC catalyzed desymmetric transformations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Qiqiao Lin","Yuanzhen Li","Deb Kumar Das","Guoxiang Zhang","Zhifei Zhao","Shuang Yang","Xinqiang Fang"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cc01011c","endpage":"6462","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T09:08:33+00:00","issns":["1364-548X"],"issue":"38","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1471421320,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cc\/c6cc01011c"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cc\/c6cc01011c","pmid":"27100939","pubdate":"2016-05-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"6459","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"N-Heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed desymmetrization of functionalized 1,4-dienes via Stetter Reaction","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nheterocyclic-carbenecatalyzed-desymmetrization-functionalized-14dienes-via-stetter-reaction"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":1196611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6958296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252986,"mean":12.238683842915,"rank":52807,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":196904,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252986,"percentile":77},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5907,"mean":3.0247761598374,"rank":487,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":5217,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5907,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":4.4795471698113,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":176,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":5}}}},"posts":{"news":[{"title":"\u798f\u5efa\u7269\u6784\u6240\u919b\u7c7b\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u6781\u6027\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76...","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=27640572980&p=1pl&v=1&x=MoNw1NxMTDNqVJPWGSJYXg","license":"public","citation_ids":[10568837,10568838,10568840,10568843],"posted_on":"2016-08-17T08:08:40+00:00","summary":"\u919b\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u662f\u6709\u673a\u5408\u6210\u3001\u836f\u7269\u5236\u5907\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u539f\u6599\u3002\u919b\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u6781\u6027\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5927\u5927\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u91cd\u8981\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd0\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u9006\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5236\u5907\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6709\u4e24\u7c7b\u4eba\u540d\u53cd\u5e94\uff08benzoin\u53cd\u5e94\u548cStetter\u53cd\u5e94\uff09\u5c31\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u919b\u7684\u6781\u6027\u7ffb\u8f6c\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd110\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u673a\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u50ac\u5316\u548c\u6c2e\u6742\u73af\u5361\u5bbe\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u98de\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cbenzoin\u548cStetter\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u50ac\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 \u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u201c\u9752\u5e74\u5343\u4eba\u8ba1\u5212\u201d\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u3001\u798f\u5efa\u7701\u767e\u4eba\u8ba1\u5212\u7b49\u8d44\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u2026","author":{"name":"Chinese Academy of Science","url":"http:\/\/www.cas.cn","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/001\/728\/normal\/Screen_Shot_2016-01-26_at_15.44.38.png?1453823095"}}]}}
