We analyzed the activation of NKT cells and their cytokine production in response to Leishmania mexicana LPG. Additionally we compared NKT-cell numbers and cytokine profile in lymph nodes of skin lesions induced by Leishmania mexicana in BALB\/c and C57BL\/6 mice. We show that LPG activates NKT cells primarily through the indirect pathway, initiating with TLR2 stimulation of dendritic cells (DC), thereby enhancing TLR2, MHC II, and CD86 expressions and IL-12p70 production. This leads to IFN-\u03b3 production by NKT cells. C57BL\/6 mice showed enhanced DC activation, which correlated with augmented IFN-\u03b3 production by NKT cells. Additionally, infected C57BL\/6 mice showed elevated percentages of NKT cells with higher IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 production in lymph nodes. We conclude that the response of NKT cells towards Leishmania mexicana LPG initiates with the indirect activation, after binding of LPG to TLR2 in DC. This indirect activation pathway enables NKT cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 during the innate phase of Leishmania infection, the magnitude of which differs between mouse strains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a96","authors":["Zamora-Chimal, Jaime","Fern\u00e1ndez-Figueroa, Edith A","Ruiz-Remigio, Adriana","Wilkins-Rodr\u00edguez, Arturo A","Delgado-Dom\u00ednguez, Jos\u00e9","Salaiza-Suazo, Norma","Guti\u00e9rrez-Kobeh, Laila","Becker, Ingeborg","Jaime Zamora-Chimal","Edith A.
