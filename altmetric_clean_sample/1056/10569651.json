Mechanism of CO<sub>2<\/sub> hydration on the proposed heterofullerenes followed the mechanistic action of \u03b1-carbonic anhydrases. The mechanism of the reaction consisted of adsorption and de-protonation of H<sub>2<\/sub>O, CO<sub>2<\/sub> interaction with hydroxyl groups, CO<sub>2<\/sub> bending, and proton transfer to give product HCO<sup>-<\/sup><sub>3<\/sub>. Free energy landscapes for the reaction showed the catalysts to be active for the reaction. H<sub>2<\/sub>O adsorption over the catalysts was exergonic while CO<sub>2<\/sub> adsorption over the catalyst-OH complex was observed to be an endergonic process. Intramolecular proton transfer resulting in the final product, HCO<sup>-<\/sup><sub>3<\/sub>, was found to be the rate limiting step for the reaction over C<sub>56<\/sub>N<sub>3<\/sub>M (M = Ru\/Rh) while H<sub>2<\/sub>O dissociation was found to be the rate limiting step for the reaction over C<sub>59<\/sub>M (M = Ru\/Rh). C<sub>56<\/sub>N<sub>3<\/sub>M catalysts were found to be superior to C<sub>59<\/sub>M catalysts for biomimetic CO<sub>2<\/sub> hydration, as signified by the free energy landscapes and energy requirements.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Verma, Manju","Deshpande, Parag A."],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201600649","endpage":"3128","first_seen_on":"2016-08-17T09:39:44+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1439-7641"],"issue":"19","journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1471426770,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1002\/cphc.201600649"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201600649\/pdf","pmid":"27442265","pubdate":"2016-08-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
