Criteria for comparison were culture positivity and time to detection (TTD). The effects of delayed entry on recovery and TTD were also evaluated.\nThe VIRTUO exhibited around 3\u00a0h faster detection time compared to the 3D system. (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for aerobic and facultative microorganisms. The difference in TTD was greatest for the B. fragilis, with a median difference of 46.67\u00a0h. The anaerobic bottle of the VIRTUO (FN Plus) did not support the growth of obligate aerobes, whereas the 3D did so. Delayed entry (studied with an E. Coli isolate) had no effect on the recovery rate but proportionally reduced TTD.\nThe VIRTUO performed better than the 3D in terms of TTD and hands-on-time. FN Plus vial appears to be more efficient than the SN bottle in the recovery of anaerobes.","altmetric_jid":"56dd9b702a83ee7d288b45c3","authors":["Miller, Nathalie","Brassinne, Laetitia","Allemeersch, Daniel"],"doi":"10.1080\/17843286.2017.1331618","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T11:27:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1784-3286","2295-3337"],"journal":"Acta Clinica Belgica","last_mentioned_on":1496834828,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28583022?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28583022","pubdate":"2017-06-07T22:11:35+00:00","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Implementation of the new VIRTUO blood culture system: evaluation and comparison to the 3D system using simulated blood cultures","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8331095,"mean":7.02255168024,"rank":7203280,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8331095,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":241536,"mean":12.444434479475,"rank":196933,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":241536,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95,"mean":2.5766170212766,"rank":76,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/entero_papers\/statuses\/872414618135568384","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20872940],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T11:27:08+00:00","author":{"name":"enterococcuspapers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/704565898690965504\/8Fli7TxI_normal.jpg","description":"PubMed search bot for enterococcus","id_on_source":"entero_papers","tweeter_id":"704561547666808832","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":61},"tweet_id":"872414618135568384"}]}}
