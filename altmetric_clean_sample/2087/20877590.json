In the present study, we sought to investigate the genetic bases of altruistic punishment (AP), which refers to the costly punishment of norm violations with potential benefit for other individuals. Recent evidence suggests that norm violations and unfairness are indexed by the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) generated neural response to expectancy violations. Given evidence on the role of serotonin and dopamine in AP as well as in FRN-generation, we explored the impact of genetic variation of serotonin and dopamine function on FRN and AP behavior in response to unfair vs. fair monetary offers in a Dictator Game (DG) with punishment option. In a sample of 45 healthy participants we observed larger FRN amplitudes to unfair DG assignments both for 7-repeat allele carriers of the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) exon III polymorphism and for l\/l-genotype carriers of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLRP). Moreover, 5-HTTLPR l\/l-genotype carriers punished unfair offers more strongly. These findings support the role of serotonin and dopamine in AP, potentially via their influence on neural mechanisms implicated in the monitoring of expectancy violations and their relation to impulsive and punishment behavior.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["S\u00f6ren Enge","Hendrik Mothes","Monika Fleischhauer","Andreas Reif","Alexander Strobel"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-02594-3","first_seen_on":"2017-06-07T12:37:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1506688470,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02594-3","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5462809","https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02594-3"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-02594-3.pdf","pmid":"28592831","pubdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","startpage":"2996","subjects":["science"],"title":"Genetic variation of dopamine and serotonin function modulates the feedback-related negativity during altruistic punishment","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/genetic-variation-dopamine-serotonin-function-modulates-feedbackrelated-negativity-during-altruistic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":3.75,"6m":3.75,"3m":3.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0.25,"6d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":1965046,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":6481648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":76},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247216,"mean":12.691050025281,"rank":74459,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":172239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247216,"percentile":69},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37889,"mean":14.766535209037,"rank":12059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":25707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37889,"percentile":67},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3045,"mean":15.687904073587,"rank":1002,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":2033,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3045,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/patilindrajeets\/statuses\/872432170962440192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20877590],"posted_on":"2017-06-07T12:36:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Indrajeet Patil","url":"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/indrajeetspatilmorality\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/714905410348650496\/sdbm2kBr_normal.jpg","description":"Former physicist trying his luck in social neuroscience and moral psychology.
