Liver function impairment was defined as an elevation of liver-related laboratory values as graded by CTCAE\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 and\/or serum bilirubin \u226530\u00a0\u00b5mol\/l and\/or development of ascites at 6-week follow-up.\nSignificant changes over time were seen in IL-1 (increase from 0.4\u00a0pg\/ml (\u00b10.7) at baseline to 1.1\u00a0pg\/ml (\u00b11.4) 3\u00a0days after RE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02)), and in IL-6 (increase from 16.8\u00a0pg\/ml (\u00b121.8) at baseline to 54.6\u00a0pg\/ml (\u00b178.2) 3\u00a0days after RE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003)). Baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were independently associated with liver function impairment at follow-up as well as decreased survival with an optimal cutoff at 6.53 and 60.8\u00a0pg\/ml, respectively.\nExpected changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after RE were shown. Furthermore, baseline values of IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with later liver dysfunction and survival. We hypothesize that these biomarkers are potential prognosticators and might help in patient selection for RE.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006de9","authors":["Max Seidensticker","Maciej Powerski","Ricarda Seidensticker","Robert Damm","Konrad Mohnike","Benjamin Garlipp","Maurice Klopffleisch","Holger Amthauer","Jens Ricke","Maciej Pech"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00270-017-1622-4","first_seen_on":"2017-03-27T15:07:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0174-1551","1432-086X"],"journal":"CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology","last_mentioned_on":1490374801,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s00270-017-1622-4"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00270-017-1622-4.pdf","pmid":"28283704","pubdate":"2017-03-10T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer US","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Imaging \/ Radiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nuclear Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ultrasound","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["radiology","cardiology"],"title":"Cytokines and 90Y-Radioembolization: Relation to Liver Function and Overall Survival","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s00270-017-1622-4","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cytokines-90yradioembolization-relation-liver-function-overall-survival"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8409255,"mean":7.0791347310873,"rank":7267968,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8409255,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":247949,"mean":13.252630495103,"rank":205265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":247949,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":597,"mean":2.4449832214765,"rank":449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":597,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":2.3203846153846,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1,"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Cytokines and 90Y-Radioembolization: Relation to Liver Function and Overall Survival","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1398710263519015&id=337254049664647","license":"public","citation_ids":[18169021],"posted_on":"2017-03-24T17:00:01+00:00","summary":"An interesting clinical investigation on the course of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines after 90Y-radioembolization (RE) of liver malignancies.","author":{"name":"ECIO - European Conference on Interventional Oncology","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/337254049664647","facebook_wall_name":"ECIO - European Conference on Interventional Oncology","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/337254049664647\/picture","id_on_source":"337254049664647"}}]}}
