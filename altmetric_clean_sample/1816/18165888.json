Inpatient and ED treatment were not associated with changes in preferences for aggressive EOL treatment over 12 months.\nAlternative measures that tap attitudes toward routine care, rather than EOL treatment preferences, may be more highly associated with healthcare utilization.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002ea8","authors":["AlbertSteven M.","LunneyJune R.","YeLei","BoudreauRobert","IvesDiane","SatterfieldSuzanne","KaplanCameron M.","WatersTeresa","AyonayonHilsa N.","RubinSusan M.","NewmanAnne B.","HarrisTamara"],"doi":"10.1089\/jpm.2016.0284","first_seen_on":"2017-03-27T11:52:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1096-6218","1557-7740"],"journal":"Journal of Palliative Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1502236800,"links":["http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0284#utm_source=FastTrack&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=jpm","http:\/\/online.liebertpub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0284","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1089\/jpm.2016.0284"],"pmid":"28333569","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":" Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.  140 Huguenot Street, 3rd Floor New Rochelle, NY 10801 USA  ","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["healthservices"],"title":"Are Preferences for Aggressive Medical Treatment Associated with Healthcare Utilization in the Very Old?","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preferences-aggressive-medical-treatment-associated-healthcare-utilization-very-old"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.45,"score_history":{"1y":5.45,"6m":5.45,"3m":1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.45},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342993,"mean":7.036443531042,"rank":1531005,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":6807120,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342993,"percentile":81},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246573,"mean":13.210441599208,"rank":63419,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":182828,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246573,"percentile":74},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1346,"mean":7.3626527881041,"rank":373,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1346,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":7.135,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":64}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":3,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":3,"Members of the public":3,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":2,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"SE":1,"GR":1,"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PalliativeMed_j\/statuses\/846328959293935616","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18165888],"posted_on":"2017-03-27T11:52:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Palliative Medicine","url":"http:\/\/www.liebertpub.com\/jpm","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1245393189\/JPM-14n2_normal.jpg","description":"Journal of Palliative Medicine (JPM) is the leading peer-reviewed journal covering medical, psycho-social, spiritual & legal issues in palliative care.","id_on_source":"PalliativeMed_j","tweeter_id":"197530275","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":4444},"tweet_id":"846328959293935616"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PatrickMayo59\/statuses\/846341938336948224","license":"gnip","rt":["PalliativeMed_j"],"citation_ids":[18165888],"posted_on":"2017-03-27T12:43:37+00:00","author":{"name":"Patrick Mayo","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/838332897933344769\/3Vi4bKMo_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"PatrickMayo59","tweeter_id":"1410326612","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":69},"tweet_id":"846341938336948224"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/helitropen\/statuses\/846382740903772161","license":"gnip","rt":["PalliativeMed_j"],"citation_ids":[18165888],"posted_on":"2017-03-27T15:25:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Helena ullgren","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Helena_Ullgren","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/853908474354446336\/aBLUMEtz_normal.jpg","description":"ONS, MSC Palliative care, coordinating contact nurse Head & Neck cancer, Stockholm-Gotland.
