Therefore, we aimed to determine whether pitavastatin has protective effects against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling in mice and also whether pitavastatin improves the brain antioxidant capacity and attenuates the oxidative injuries in kindled mice. Methods: Twenty-four mice were randomly divided into four groups (each group n=6); control, PTZ-kindling and PTZ-kindled rats treated with pitavastatin (1&4 mg\/kg). PTZ kindling seizures were induced by repetitive intraperitoneal injections of PTZ (65 mg\/kg) every 48 hours till day twenty-one. Animals received daily oral pitavastatin for twenty-one days. Latency, score and duration of the seizures were recorded. The activities of catalase (CAT) ad superoxide dismutase (SOD), and likewise the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrate were assessed in the brains of all rats. Results: There was a progressive reduction in latency of the kindled rats in the next injections of PTZ. Pitavastatin reduced this value (latency) particularly at higher dose. Seizures duration and score also decreased in treatment groups. SOD and CAT activities significantly decreased in PTZ-kindling group by 62% and 64%, respectively, but pitavastatin did not significantly change the SOD and CAT activities. Brain MDA and nitrate significantly increased in PTZ-kindling group by 53% and 30%, respectively. Pitavastatin at higher dose significantly decreased the MDA and nitrate contents of PTZ-kindling rats by 45% and 32%, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that pitavastatin can improve the behavioral expression of the PTZ-kindling rats and attenuate the seizure-induced oxidative\/nitrosative damage.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef762a83ee09648b521f","authors":["Nastaran Faghihi","Mohammad Taghi Mohammadi"],"doi":"10.15171\/apb.2017.035","first_seen_on":"2017-09-01T00:05:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2228-5881","2251-7308"],"issue":"2","journal":"Advanced Pharmaceutical Bulletin","last_mentioned_on":1504400804,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5527244\/"],"pmcid":"PMC5527244","pmid":"28761832","pubdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Tabriz University of Medical Sciences","startpage":"291","title":"Anticonvulsant and Antioxidant Effects of Pitavastatin Against Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Kindling in Mice","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticonvulsant-antioxidant-effects-pitavastatin-against-pentylenetetrazolinduced-kindling-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.4,"score_history":{"1y":3.4,"6m":3.4,"3m":3.4,"1m":3.4,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8355069,"mean":7.046560105308,"rank":2035438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6319689,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8355069,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120834,"mean":12.291123616893,"rank":35536,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":85295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120834,"percentile":70},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87,"mean":1.6022093023256,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/bloomingdayz\/statuses\/903408301366325248","license":"gnip","rt":["AlainNolan"],"citation_ids":[24588784],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T00:04:58+00:00","author":{"name":"bloomingdayz","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2386748700\/6t549et1m8en3hpg8bxf_normal.jpeg","description":"\ud314\ub85c\uc6cc \uac70\uc808\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!","id_on_source":"bloomingdayz","tweeter_id":"309617996","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1},"tweet_id":"903408301366325248"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jangyj76\/statuses\/903418417889198081","license":"gnip","rt":["AlainNolan"],"citation_ids":[24588784],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T00:45:10+00:00","author":{"name":"\uafc8\uafb8\ub294\ubc14\ub2e4","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/843459595502665732\/m2yovKDt_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"jangyj76","tweeter_id":"2988962099","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":228},"tweet_id":"903418417889198081"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lunapapa99\/statuses\/903422289621876736","license":"gnip","rt":["AlainNolan"],"citation_ids":[24588784],"posted_on":"2017-09-01T01:00:33+00:00","author":{"name":"weirdfish","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/896383174397140994\/afvnfKOH_normal.jpg","description":"NO PASA NADA","id_on_source":"lunapapa99","tweeter_id":"173875580","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":36},"tweet_id":"903422289621876736"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/gghp1234\/statuses\/904148623847337984","license":"gnip","rt":["AlainNolan"],"citation_ids":[24588784],"posted_on":"2017-09-03T01:06:44+00:00","author":{"name":"\uac15\ud76c\uad8c","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/607508384703586304\/PcHm6n1i_normal.png","id_on_source":"gghp1234","tweeter_id":"535378005","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":12},"tweet_id":"904148623847337984"}]}}
