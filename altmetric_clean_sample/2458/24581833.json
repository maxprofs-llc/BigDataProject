Signalment, material ingested, dose and route of xylazine administration, success of emesis and recovery of foreign material ingested, use of a reversal agent, and adverse effects were noted. The induction of emesis was successful in 29\/48 (60%) of cats. Sedation was the most common adverse effect and was noted in 15\/48 (31%) of patients.\nXylazine is safe and reasonably effective at inducing emesis in cats.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ce3cf058f610000650","authors":["Thies, Margaret","Bracker, Kiko","Sinnott, Virginia"],"doi":"10.1111\/vec.12641","first_seen_on":"2017-08-31T19:22:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["14793261","1476-4431"],"journal":"Journal of Veterinary Emergency & Critical Care","last_mentioned_on":1504218626,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12641\/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/vec.12641\/pdf","pmid":"28853243","pubdate":"2017-08-29T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"subjects":["criticalcare","emergencymedicine"],"title":"Retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of xylazine for inducing emesis in cats: 48 cats (2011-2015)","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/retrospective-evaluation-effectiveness-xylazine-inducing-emesis-cats-48-cats-20112015"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.1,"score_history":{"1y":1.1,"6m":1.1,"3m":1.1,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4488931,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3936160,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175182,"mean":12.479206569206,"rank":94422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":79454,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175182,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":628,"mean":1.821033492823,"rank":146,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":482,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":628,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":2.4892857142857,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Other":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CA":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Albinovet\/statuses\/903336322596823040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24581833],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T19:18:57+00:00","author":{"name":"Stefano Cattaneo DVM","url":"http:\/\/veterinarialbino.com\/\/twitter_en.html","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1673372763\/vet_tweet_normal.png","description":"Daily updates about pet health covering the last articles published in veterinary journals.","id_on_source":"Albinovet","tweeter_id":"418669767","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2115},"tweet_id":"903336322596823040"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MarieGabvet\/statuses\/903384513946021892","license":"gnip","rt":["Albinovet"],"citation_ids":[24581833],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T22:30:26+00:00","author":{"name":"Marie-Gabrielle","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/825570753181601797\/xQ2EhSHy_normal.jpg","description":"veterinarian, interest in gardening, politics, most of the time wishing I had a cleaning lady...","id_on_source":"MarieGabvet","tweeter_id":"825564953474121730","geo":{"lt":44.22976,"ln":-76.48098,"country":"CA"},"followers":9},"tweet_id":"903384513946021892"}]}}
