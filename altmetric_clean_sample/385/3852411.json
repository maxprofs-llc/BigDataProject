The novel diiron complex was characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques, electrochemistry, and ultrafast time-resolved methods. Spectroscopy and redox behavior was correlated with the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations. An unexpected degree of coupling between the two Fc ligands was observed. Despite a lack of conjugation between the donor and acceptor, the complex undergoes very rapid (\u03c4 = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 ps) photoinduced intramolecular charge separation followed by subpicosecond charge recombination to form a triplet state with a lifetime of 4.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Eranda Maligaspe"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00494","first_seen_on":"2015-03-30T18:05:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1427764349,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/acs.inorgchem.5b00494"],"pmid":"25822143","pubdate":"2015-03-31T22:00:51+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Synthesis and Charge-Transfer Dynamics in a Ferrocene-Containing Organoboryl aza-BODIPY Donor\u2013Acceptor Triad with Boron as the Hub","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/synthesis-chargetransfer-dynamics-ferrocenecontaining-organoboryl-azabodipy-donoracceptor-triad-boro"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4941691,"mean":5.8615714360898,"rank":2622189,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1653074,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4941691,"percentile":33},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146360,"mean":10.237874363722,"rank":84527,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":46253,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146360,"percentile":31},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7072,"mean":1.0435768632442,"rank":1846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":4595,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7072,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":302,"mean":1.215780730897,"rank":109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":302,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
