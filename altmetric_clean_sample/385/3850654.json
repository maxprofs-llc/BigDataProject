Eighty-two healthy subjects, 10 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 10 with spinal muscular atrophy and 10 with spinal cord injuries were studied. DTbM was compared with active surface method (ASM), threshold-based method (TbM) and manual outlining (ground truth). Accuracy of segmentations was scored visually by a radiologist in cervical and thoracic cord regions. Accuracy was also quantified at the cervical and thoracic levels as well as at C2 vertebral level. To construct a cervical template from healthy subjects' images (n=59), a standardization pipeline was designed leading to well-centered straight spinal cord images and accurate probability tissue map.\nVisual scoring showed better performance for DTbM than for ASM. Mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 95.71% for DTbM and 90.78% for ASM at the cervical level and 94.27% for DTbM and 89.93% for ASM at the thoracic level. Finally, at C2 vertebral level, mean DSC was 97.98% for DTbM compared with 98.02% for TbM and 96.76% for ASM. DTbM showed similar accuracy compared with TbM, but with the advantage of limited manual interaction.\nA semi-automated segmentation method with limited manual intervention was introduced and validated on 3T images, enabling the construction of a cervical spinal cord template.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Mohamed-Mounir El Mendili","Rapha\u00ebl Chen","Brice Tiret","No\u00e9mie Villard","St\u00e9phanie Trunet","M\u00e9lanie P\u00e9l\u00e9grini-Issac","St\u00e9phane Leh\u00e9ricy","Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Pradat","Habib Benali"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0122224","first_seen_on":"2015-03-30T03:30:38+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1428063301,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0122224"],"pmid":"25816143","pubdate":"2015-03-27T07:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0122224","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Fast and Accurate Semi-Automated Segmentation Method of Spinal Cord MR Images at 3T Applied to the Construction of a Cervical Spinal Cord Template.","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/fast-accurate-semiautomated-segmentation-method-spinal-cord-mr-images-3t-applied-construction-cervic"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4953575,"mean":5.8708535421125,"rank":1897469,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3015496,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4953575,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146510,"mean":10.238724597124,"rank":55576,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":89480,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146510,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":87439,"mean":9.1913249845605,"rank":31331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":54949,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":87439,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4564,"mean":9.695231645847,"rank":1793,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":2692,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4564,"percentile":58}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
