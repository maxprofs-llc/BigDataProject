To combat this devastating condition, research efforts have been redirected from treatment toward prevention strategies. Although there are several proposed risk-reduction strategies, one intervention gaining support is the administration of prophylactic enteral probiotics. Regardless of growing evidentiary support and a benign safety profile, neonatal providers have yet to embrace this therapy. This article provides an overview of the proposed benefits of probiotics, focusing on their role as a NEC prevention strategy. A review of several sentinel research studies targeting preterm, VLBW, and ELBW infants is provided. Considerations for ongoing research are reviewed. Finally, two evidence-based NEC prevention probiotics protocols are presented.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056a1","authors":["Anderson, Sharon"],"doi":"10.1891\/0730-0832.34.2.83","first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T18:28:12+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1539-2880"],"issue":"2","journal":"Neonatal Network","last_mentioned_on":1428088077,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/springer\/jnn\/2015\/00000034\/00000002\/art00003"],"pmid":"26803090","pubdate":"2016-01-24T22:00:07+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing","perinatology"],"title":"Probiotics for Preterm Infants: A Premature or Overdue Necrotizing Enterocolitis Prevention Strategy?","type":"article","volume":"34","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/probiotics-preterm-infants-premature-overdue-necrotizing-enterocolitis-prevention-strategy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.05,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.05},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5030073,"mean":5.9653562811812,"rank":1235818,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":3790548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5030073,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":148783,"mean":10.250803282655,"rank":50454,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":98231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":148783,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81,"mean":1.719375,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":73,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81,"percentile":90},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
