However, the translation of effective research findings to the school setting can be problematic. In order to improve effective translation of future interventions, it is imperative key challenges and facilitators of implementing health interventions be understood from a school's perspective.\nNineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in primary schools (headteachers n\u2009=\u200916, deputy headteacher n\u2009=\u20091, healthy school co-ordinator n\u2009=\u20092). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.\nThe main challenges for schools in implementing health interventions were; government-led academic priorities, initiative overload, low autonomy for schools, lack of staff support, lack of facilities and resources, litigation risk and parental engagement. Recommendations to increase the application of interventions into the school setting included; better planning and organisation, greater collaboration with schools and external partners and elements addressing sustainability. Child-centred and cross-curricular approaches, inclusive whole school approaches and assurances to be supportive of the school ethos were also favoured for consideration.\nThis work explores schools' perspectives regarding the implementation of health interventions and utilises these thoughts to create guidelines for developing future school-based interventions. Recommendations include the need to account for variability between school environments, staff and pupils. Interventions with an element of adaptability were preferred over the delivery of blanket fixed interventions. Involving schools in the developmental stage would add useful insights to ensure the interventions can be tailored to best suit each individual schools' needs and improve implementation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","authors":["Danielle Christian","Charlotte Todd","Helen Davies","Jaynie Rance","Gareth Stratton","Frances Rapport","Sinead Brophy","Christian, Danielle","Todd, Charlotte","Davies, Helen","Rance, Jaynie","Stratton, Gareth","Rapport, Frances","Brophy, Sinead"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12889-015-1557-0","first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T21:58:35+00:00","issns":["","1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1483711619,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/238\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/15\/238","http:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12889-015-1557-0"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12889-015-1557-0.pdf","pmid":"25778248","pubdate":"2015-12-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biostatistics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Environmental Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Epidemiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Vaccine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"238","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Community led active schools programme (CLASP) exploring the implementation of health interventions in primary schools: headteachers\u2019 perspectives","type":"article","volume":"15","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/community-led-active-schools-programme-clasp-exploring-implementation-health-interventions-primary-s"},"altmetric_score":{"score":12.85,"score_history":{"1y":8,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":12.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992937,"mean":6.7399601605663,"rank":612928,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7377933,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992937,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":200693,"mean":9.2471312558549,"rank":22965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":177648,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":200693,"percentile":88},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6860,"mean":8.8274582300627,"rank":815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":6039,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6860,"percentile":88},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":227,"mean":7.4232300884956,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":192,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":227,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
