However, DHL and DPL are not concordant, and it is unclear whether MYC and BCL2 aberrations have prognostic impact in DPL patients. In a cohort of 135 patients diagnosed with large B-cell lymphoma between 2010 and 2014 in whom MYC\/8q24 and BCL2\/t(14;18)(q32;q21) statuses were assessed by FISH at diagnosis, we evaluated MYC and BCL2 expression by immunohistochemistry. A total of 54 (40%) cases were positive for MYC and BCL2 supporting DPL. Among them, 19 (35%) had MYC rearrangement including 11 DHLs, 12 (22%) had multiple copies of MYC, 19 had no MYC abnormalities, and in 4 cases FISH analysis failed. BCL2 abnormalities were present in 28\/54 (52%) cases (20 rearranged and 8 multiple copies). MYC rearrangement correlated with a significantly worse overall survival in DPL (P<0.05), whereas BCL2 genetic status did not correlate with survival (P>0.05). MYC and BCL2 expression by immunohistochemistry correlates with gene status by FISH; however, immunohistochemistry is neither specific nor adequately sensitive to be used as a surrogate for MYC and BCL2 gene status using any cutoff level. In conclusion, MYC rearrangement identifies a subset of patients with DPL who have a significantly worse prognosis. Although immunohistochemical assessment for MYC and BCL2 may be a helpful initial screen to identify higher-risk patients, FISH analysis for MYC remains important for further risk stratification in patients with DPL.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f61000698e","authors":["Wang, Xuan Julia","Medeiros, L Jeffrey","Lin, Pei","Yin, C Cameron","Hu, Shimin","Thompson, Mary Ann","Li, Shaoying"],"doi":"10.1097\/pas.0000000000000433","first_seen_on":"2015-04-01T10:08:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0147-5185","1532-0979"],"issue":"9","journal":"The American Journal of Surgical Pathology","last_mentioned_on":1439817546,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/publishahead\/MYC_Cytogenetic_Status_Correlates_With_Expression.98447.aspx","http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/9000\/00000\/MYC_Cytogenetic_Status_Correlates_With_Expression.98447.pdf","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25828389","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/Abstract\/2015\/09000\/MYC_Cytogenetic_Status_Correlates_With_Expression.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/ajsp\/9000\/00000\/MYC_Cytogenetic_Status_Correlates_With_Expression.98447.pdf","pmid":"25828389","pubdate":"2015-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pathology","generalsurgery"],"title":"MYC Cytogenetic Status Correlates With Expression and Has Prognostic Significance in Patients With MYC\/BCL2 Protein Double-positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma","type":"article","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/myc-cytogenetic-status-correlates-expression-prognostic-significance-patients-mycbcl2-protein-double"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8258564,"mean":6.9741565882523,"rank":3280611,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4951170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8258564,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":202050,"mean":9.4112872718995,"rank":69969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":130863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":202050,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1720,"mean":4.5300942408377,"rank":930,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1720,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":6.8008928571429,"rank":41,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
