Compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Interventions that decrease the chance of a cesarean delivery include avoiding non-medically indicated induction of labor, avoiding amniotomy, and having a doula present. In North America, the most common reasons for cesarean delivery include elective repeat cesarean delivery, dystocia or failure to progress, malpresentation, and fetal heart rate tracings that suggest fetal distress. Post-cesarean delivery complications include pain, endomyometritis, wound separation\/infection, urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal problems, deep venous thrombosis, and septic thrombophlebitis. Women with no risk factors for deep venous thrombosis other than the postpartum state and the operative delivery do not require thromboembolism prophylaxis other than early ambulation. A pregnant woman's decision to attempt a trial of labor after cesarean delivery or have a planned repeat cesarean delivery involves a balancing of maternal and neonatal risks, as well as personal preference after counseling by her physician. Approximately 75% of attempted trials of labor after cesarean delivery are successful. Provision of advanced maternity care practices by family physicians, including serving as primary surgeons for cesarean deliveries, is consistent with the goals of the patient-centered medical home.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056f9","authors":["Quinlan, Jeffrey D","Murphy, Neil J"],"first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T22:35:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1532-0650"],"issue":"3","journal":"American Family Physician","last_mentioned_on":1463191146,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822271?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822271?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822271","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822271?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"25822271","pubdate":"2015-04-01T22:03:10+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Cesarean delivery: counseling issues and complication management.","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/cesarean-delivery-counseling-issues-complication-management"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7695064,"mean":6.6060460035168,"rank":3418602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":4200397,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7695064,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":199262,"mean":9.1965573795174,"rank":85117,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":110659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":199262,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":3.442874400767,"rank":661,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":363,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":34},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":4.4666666666667,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
