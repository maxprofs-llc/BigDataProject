Several clinical trials reported that GTE was well tolerated and had potential anti-cancer efficacy. Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) is the primary compound responsible for the anti-cancer effect of GTE; however, the effect of EGCG alone is limited. To identify GTE compounds capable of potentiating EGCG bioactivity, we performed metabolic profiling of 43 green tea cultivar panels by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Here, we revealed the polyphenol eriodictyol significantly potentiated apoptosis induction by EGCG in vitro and in a mouse tumour model by amplifying EGCG-induced activation of the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR)\/protein kinase B\/endothelial nitric oxide synthase\/protein kinase C delta\/acid sphingomyelinase signalling pathway. Our results show that metabolic profiling is an effective chemical-mining approach for identifying botanical drugs with therapeutic potential against multiple myeloma. Metabolic profiling-based data mining could be an efficient strategy for screening additional bioactive compounds and identifying effective chemical combinations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Motofumi Kumazoe","Motofumi Kumazoe","Yoshinori Fujimura","Shiori Hidaka","Yoonhee Kim","Kanako Murayama","Mika Takai","Yuhui Huang","Shuya Yamashita","Motoki Murata","Daisuke Miura","Hiroyuki Wariishi","Mari Maeda-Yamamoto","Hirofumi Tachibana"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep09474","first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T10:08:07+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1427805082,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/srep09474"],"pmid":"25824377","pubdate":"2015-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutritional supplements","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Myeloma","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["science"],"title":"Metabolic Profiling-based Data-mining for an Effective Chemical Combination to Induce Apoptosis of Cancer Cells","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/metabolic-profilingbased-datamining-effective-chemical-combination-induce-apoptosis-cancer-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5034930,"mean":5.9653228424835,"rank":1971624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":3030203,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5034930,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":149113,"mean":10.251817278287,"rank":58328,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":89492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":149113,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15806,"mean":13.32696994622,"rank":6015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":9673,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15806,"percentile":61},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":826,"mean":14.226722424242,"rank":340,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":474,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":826,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
