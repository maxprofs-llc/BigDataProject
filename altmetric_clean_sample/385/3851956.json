Here we identified a role for SETX in controlling the antiviral response. Cells that had undergone depletion of SETX and SETX-deficient cells derived from patients with AOA2 had higher expression of antiviral mediators in response to infection than did wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we propose a model whereby SETX attenuates the activity of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at genes stimulated after a virus is sensed and thus controls the magnitude of the host response to pathogens and the biogenesis of various RNA viruses (e.g., influenza A virus and West Nile virus). Our data indicate a potentially causal link among inborn errors in SETX, susceptibility to infection and the development of neurologic disorders.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003165","authors":["Matthew S Miller","Matthew S Miller","Alexander Rialdi","Jessica Sook Yuin Ho","Micah Tilove","Luis Martinez-Gil","Natasha P Moshkina","Zuleyma Peralta","Justine Noel","Camilla Melegari","Ana M Maestre","Panagiotis Mitsopoulos","Joaqu\u00edn Madrenas","Sven Heinz","Chris Benner","John A T Young","Alicia R Feagins","Christopher F Basler","Ana Fernandez-Sesma","Olivier J Becherel","Martin F Lavin","Harm van Bakel","Ivan Marazzi"],"doi":"10.1038\/ni.3132","first_seen_on":"2015-03-30T15:28:42+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid","phs","cihr"],"issns":["1529-2916"],"journal":"Nature Immunology","last_mentioned_on":1436956659,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1038\/ni.3132","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/ni\/journal\/vaop\/ncurrent\/full\/ni.3132.html","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/doifinder\/10.1038\/ni.3132","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822250","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25822250?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"25822250","pubdate":"2015-03-30T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Virology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Senataxin suppresses the antiviral transcriptional response and controls viral biogenesis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/senataxin-suppresses-antiviral-transcriptional-response-controls-viral-biogenesis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":97.922,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":97.922},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7140581,"mean":6.3066528900984,"rank":64573,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":7076233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7140581,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":195135,"mean":9.0978251047999,"rank":3047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":192088,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":195135,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2000,"mean":9.4779779889945,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":1973,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2000,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":16.325268292683,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":41,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6,"Scientists":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
