These changes can cause significant problems in everyday life for people with bvFTD and their families, and have implications for health and society. Currently, there are no suitable evidence-based specific interventions for people with bvFTD. This scoping review aims to identify the self-expressed needs, demands and coping strategies of people with bvFTD. Identifying these issues is the first step towards the development of need-based psycho-social interventions for people with bvFTD. A comprehensive literature research was conducted of German and English scientific articles published between January 2000 and October 2014 using the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, SocINDEX, GeroLit, the Cochrane Library, ProQuest, the German National Library and additional search strategies in terms of a scoping review. Articles were identified by combining search terms related to 'frontotemporal dementia' with terms related to 'self-expressions', 'needs\/demands' and 'coping'. After excluding duplicates, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 2317 records for eligibility. Because eligibility could not be assessed from the titles or abstracts of 28 articles, those articles were assessed using the full text. One poster abstract met our research question and a few articles were related, but no article met all of the inclusion criteria. This lack of scientifically based knowledge concerning the perspective of people with bvFTD is discussed with reference to the search strategy and the research questions, disease-related aspects such as changes in behaviour or language and emotions and the difficulties in researching this topic. Recommendations are formulated for future research considering the perspective of people with bvFTD and that will involve the development of appropriate data collection methods. Subsequently, specialised interventions must be developed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f6100029b8","authors":["Dinand, Claudia","Nover, Sabine Ursula","Holle, Daniela","Zischka, Matthias","Halek, Margareta"],"doi":"10.1111\/hsc.12225","endpage":"385","first_seen_on":"2015-04-01T06:20:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1365-2524"],"issue":"4","journal":"Health & Social Care in the Community","last_mentioned_on":1428710400,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hsc.12225\/abstract;jsessionid=7D1D3CD38814D69632E4368E0975FA3C.f02t04","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25827780"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/hsc.12225\/pdf","pmid":"25827780","pubdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Social Work","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"375","subjects":["healthservices","socialsciences"],"title":"What is known about the subjective needs of people with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia?
