ATMSCs overexpressing Oct4 and Sox2 (Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs) showed enhanced proliferation and multipotency. Hence, we hypothesized that Oct4 and Sox2 can increase \"transdifferentiation\" of ATMSCs into cells of the hepatic lineage. In this study, we generated Oct4- and Sox2-overexpressing human ATMSCs by liposomal transfection. We confirmed the expression of mesenchymal stem cell surface markers without morphological alterations in both red-fluorescent protein (RFP) (control)- and Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs by flow cytometry. After induction of differentiation into hepatocyte-like cells, the morphology of ATMSCs changed and they began to appear as round or polygonal epithelioid cells. Hepatic markers were evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by immunofluorescence. The results showed that albumin was strongly expressed in hepatogenic differentiated Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs, whereas the expression level of \u03b1-fetoprotein was lower than that of RFP-ATMSCs. The functionality of hepatocytes was evaluated by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and urea assays. The number of PAS-positive cells was significantly higher and urea production was significantly higher in Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs compared to that in RFP-ATMSCs. Taken together, the hepatocyte-like cells derived from Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs were mature hepatocytes, possibly functional hepatocytes with enhanced capacity to store glycogen and produce urea. In this study, we demonstrated the enhanced transdifferentiation of Oct4- and Sox2-overexpressing ATMSCs into hepatocyte-like cells that have enhanced hepatocyte-specific functions. Therefore, we expect that Oct4\/Sox2-ATMSCs may become a very useful source for hepatocyte regeneration or liver cell transplantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Sei-Myoung Han","Ye-Rin Coh","Jin-Ok Ahn","Goo Jang","Soo Young Yum","Sung-Keun Kang","Hee-Woo Lee","Hwa-Young Youn"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0108874","first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T03:26:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1427896517,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0108874","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0108874"],"pmid":"25815812","pubdate":"2015-03-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0108874","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Enhanced Hepatogenic Transdifferentiation of Human Adipose Tissue Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Gene Engineering with Oct4 and Sox2","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/enhanced-hepatogenic-transdifferentiation-human-adipose-tissue-mesenchymal-stem-cells-gene-engineeri"},"altmetric_score":{"score":9.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":9.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7367623,"mean":6.4006371575483,"rank":725287,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":6640871,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7367623,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":196455,"mean":9.1477094587029,"rank":29026,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":167361,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":196455,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":105425,"mean":10.155570704963,"rank":16344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":89054,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":105425,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5011,"mean":10.057078642715,"rank":774,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":4236,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5011,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
