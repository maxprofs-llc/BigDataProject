Gene expression profiling may be a tool to identify markers of antidepressant treatment response and new potential drug targets. In a first step, we selected 12 male, age- and severity-matched pairs of remitters and nonresponders, and analyzed expression profiles in peripheral blood at admission and after 2 and 5 weeks of treatment using Illumina expression arrays. We identified 127 transcripts significantly associated with treatment response with a minimal P-value of 9.41 \u00d7 10(-)(4) (false discovery rate-corrected). Analysis of selected transcripts in an independent replication sample of 142 depressed inpatients confirmed that lower expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORa, P=6.23 \u00d7 10(-4)), germinal center expressed transcript 2 (GCET2, P=2.08 \u00d7 10(-2)) and chitinase 3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2, P=4.45 \u00d7 10(-2)) on admission were associated with beneficial treatment response. In addition, leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) significantly decreased after 5 weeks of treatment in responders (P=2.91 \u00d7 10(-2)). Additional genetic, in vivo stress responsitivity data and murine gene expression findings corroborate our finding of RORa as a transcriptional marker of antidepressant response. In summary, using a genome-wide transcriptomics approach and subsequent validation studies, we identified several transcripts including the circadian gene transcript RORa that may serve as biomarkers indicating antidepressant treatment response.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008be7","authors":["J M Hennings","J M Hennings","M Uhr","T Klengel","P Weber","B P\u00fctz","C Touma","D Czamara","M Ising","F Holsboer","S Lucae"],"doi":"10.1038\/tp.2015.9","first_seen_on":"2015-03-31T18:31:28+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2158-3188"],"journal":"Translational Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1428644404,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/tp\/journal\/v5\/n3\/full\/tp20159a.html","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25826113"],"pmid":"25826113","pubdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Predictive markers","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Molecular neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Clinical genetics","scheme":"npg"}],"subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"RNA expression profiling in depressed patients suggests retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha as a biomarker for antidepressant response.","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rna-expression-profiling-depressed-patients-suggests-retinoidrelated-orphan-receptor-alpha-biomarker"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8137016,"mean":6.8776314466597,"rank":3414432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4671409,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8137016,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":201166,"mean":9.3616888325505,"rank":76076,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":122863,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":201166,"percentile":61},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1021,"mean":19.462147058824,"rank":595,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":402,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1021,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":47,"mean":11.820304347826,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":47,"percentile":19}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
