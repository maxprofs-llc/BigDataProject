Tender and swollen joint counts, including enthesiopathy, physician's assessment of disease activity on a visual analog scale (MDglob), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and patient satisfaction with disease status (PatSat: 1 = excellent to 5 = unsatisfactory) were recorded. Factorial analysis was performed and alpha, as a measure of reliability, and tau were calculated. The ultimate five-item questionnaire, calculated by (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5)\/5, was then handed over to 152 PsA outpatients (mean age 54.02 years; age range 26-80 years; 82 male, 70 female), and analyzed accordingly.\nAnalyzing the internal consistency of the prototype questionnaire revealed the highest alpha value of 0.849, on deleting the question targeting disease course. Alpha for the final Stockerau Activity Score for Psoriatic Arthritis (SASPA) was 0.875, with all items contributing to the final result (item loading from 0.573 to 0.910). Kendall's tau for the relationship between SASPA scores and swollen joint count, tender joint count, and MDglob was 0.34, 0.416, and 0.392, respectively. The sensitivity of the questionnaire to change was demonstrated in patients starting treatment with a tumor necrosis factor blocker (standardized mean difference: 2.1).\nThe SASPA questionnaire constitutes a fully patient-administered tool to monitor PsA activity. Its reliability, convergent validity, and sensitivity to change were demonstrated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007ca","authors":["Burkhard F Leeb","Pia M Haindl","Hans-Peter Brezinschek","Harsono T H Mai","Christoph Deutsch","Bernhard Rintelen"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12891-015-0512-7","first_seen_on":"2015-04-01T04:28:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1471-2474"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","last_mentioned_on":1427862519,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/16\/73\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/16\/73"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/s12891-015-0512-7.pdf","pmid":"25887796","pubdate":"2015-04-19T22:02:28+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthopedics","physiology"],"title":"Patient-centered psoriatic arthritis (PsA) activity assessment by Stockerau Activity Score for Psoriatic Arthritis (SASPA)","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/patientcentered-psoriatic-arthritis-psa-activity-assessment-stockerau-activity-score-psoriatic-arthr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4946953,"mean":5.8654396913528,"rank":3301165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1447295,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4946953,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":146794,"mean":10.259298127295,"rank":100608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":39218,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":146794,"percentile":26},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1666,"mean":4.2150942942943,"rank":1380,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":250,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1666,"percentile":15},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":5.7086274509804,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":7}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
