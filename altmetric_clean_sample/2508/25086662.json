Here, we aim to revise the concept of MCI and its subtypes, addressing the problems of classification not only from the psychometric point of view or by using alternative methods, such as latent class analysis, but also considering the absence of normative data. In addition to the well-known influence of certain factors on cognitive function, such as educational level and cultural traits, recent studies highlight the relevance of other factors that may significantly affect the genesis and evolution of MCI: subjective memory complaints, loneliness, social isolation, etc. The present work will contemplate the most relevant attempts to clarify the issue of MCI categorization and classification, combining our own data with that from recent studies which suggest the role of relevant psychosocial factors in MCI.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f21","authors":["Mar\u00eda D\u00edaz-Mardomingo","Sara Garc\u00eda-Herranz","Raquel Rodr\u00edguez-Fern\u00e1ndez","C\u00e9sar Venero","Herminia Peraita"],"doi":"10.3390\/brainsci7090111","first_seen_on":"2017-09-11T02:43:36+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2076-3425"],"issue":"9","journal":"Brain Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1506863247,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3425\/7\/9\/111"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2076-3425\/7\/9\/111\/pdf","pmid":"28862676","pubdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Problems in Classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): One or Multiple Syndromes?","type":"article","volume":"7"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":1.6,"1w":1.1,"6d":1.1,"5d":1.1,"4d":1.1,"3d":1.1,"2d":0.85,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8463421,"mean":7.1088797377338,"rank":3989047,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4440270,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8463421,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":157927,"mean":11.829370173372,"rank":69356,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":87343,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":157927,"percentile":55},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":246,"mean":5.9053224489796,"rank":137,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":246,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":4.2677419354839,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"JP":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BrainSci_MDPI\/statuses\/907072043018985472","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25086662],"posted_on":"2017-09-11T02:43:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Brain Sciences_MDPI","url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/journal\/brainsci","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/817271358518226947\/GhBxCYqI_normal.jpg","description":"Brain Sciences (ISSN 2076-3425;
