Accompanied with this appreciation, new methods and technologies have been designed for analyzing protein-protein interactions both in vitro and in vivo. These technologies have been applied to several classes of drug metabolizing enzymes, including: cytochrome P450's (CYPs), monoamine oxidases (MAOs), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and sulfotransferases (SULTs). In this review, we offer a brief description and assessment of the impact of many of these technologies to the study of protein-protein interactions in drug disposition. The still expanding list of these techniques and assays has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how these enzymes carry out their important functions in vivo.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc18","authors":["Lampe, Jed N."],"doi":"10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T14:42:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1663-9812"],"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1502710324,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521\/full?utm_source=S-TWT&utm_medium=SNET&utm_campaign=ECO_FPHAR_XXXXXXXX_auto-dlvrit%0A","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521\/full?utm_content=bufferbbb2e&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521\/full?utm_content=bufferffbb7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fphar.2017.00521\/full?utm_content=bufferd6851&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pmcid":"PMC5550701","pmid":"28848438","pubdate":"2017-08-08T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"title":"Advances in the Understanding of Protein-Protein Interactions in Drug Metabolizing Enzymes through the Use of Biophysical Techniques","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advances-understanding-proteinprotein-interactions-drug-metabolizing-enzymes-through-biophysical-tec"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":1.5,"6m":1.5,"3m":1.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8372629,"mean":7.0578283965246,"rank":3972901,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4214252,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8372629,"percentile":50},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":190854,"mean":12.537123754932,"rank":87257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":97879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":190854,"percentile":51},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2037,"mean":3.4950746561886,"rank":499,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":1457,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2037,"percentile":71},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":210,"mean":1.3483253588517,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":175,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":210,"percentile":83}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":3},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"CH":1,"GH":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Advances in the Understanding of Protein-Protein Interactions in Drug Metabolizing Enzymes through the Use of Biophysical Techniques","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1529564947110504&id=129268387140174","license":"public","citation_ids":[23541035],"posted_on":"2017-08-13T20:11:54+00:00","summary":"Advances in the Understanding of Protein-Protein Interactions in Drug Metabolizing Enzymes through the Use of Biophysical Techniques\n\nJed N.
