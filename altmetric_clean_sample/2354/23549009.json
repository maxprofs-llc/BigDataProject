Clinical characteristics, joint distribution, development of chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (CIRD), as well as classification according to the 2010 ACR\/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (2010 RA criteria) were studied. Predictors for development of CIRD were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analyses.\nThe knee (49.3%), ankle (16.7%) and wrist (14.1%) were the most frequently affected joints among the 347 included patients. Ninety-one patients (26.2%) developed CIRD during follow-up; 21 (6.1%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and 16 (4.6%) with psoriatic arthritis. Longer duration of joint swelling, joint localization, and ACPA- and RF positivity were independent predictors of CIRD. Six of 58 (10.3%) patients with ankle monoarthritis and 21 of 49 (42.9%) patients with wrist monoarthritis developed CIRD during follow-up. The 2010 RA criteria captured all patients diagnosed with seropositive RA at an early stage, mostly within three months.\nApproximately one-fourth of patients with recent-onset monoarthritis developed CIRD over 2 years. Patients presenting with ankle arthritis rarely developed CIRD, whereas patients presenting with wrist arthritis more frequently did so. Longer duration of joint swelling and ACPA- and RF positivity were also predictive of CIRD. Our findings facilitate early identification of monoarthritis patients with unfavorable prognosis.
