Under mild reaction conditions, a wide range of monobrominated aromatic compounds can be obtained in excellent yields. The reaction can be operated using an extremely low catalyst loading (0.05 mol %) with the inexpensive brominating agent N-bromosuccinimide. The versatility of this catalytic protocol has been demonstrated by the scale-up reaction with a 0.01 mol % catalyst loading to provide the selectively halogenated compound in quantitative yield.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003265","authors":["Xiaodong Xiong","Fei Tan","Ying-Yeung Yeung"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.orglett.7b01899","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T14:11:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1523-7060","1523-7052"],"journal":"Organic Letters","last_mentioned_on":1502180858,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.orglett.7b01899"],"pmid":"28782957","pubdate":"2017-08-07T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Zwitterionic-Salt-Catalyzed Site-Selective Monobromination of Arenes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/zwitterionicsaltcatalyzed-siteselective-monobromination-arenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8342643,"mean":7.0366737244549,"rank":7212879,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8342643,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175949,"mean":12.2775600632,"rank":143965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175949,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3902,"mean":3.4120712637785,"rank":3629,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3902,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":74,"mean":3.729397260274,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":74,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
