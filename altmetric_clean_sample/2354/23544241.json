Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate how the size of antibody variants, as well as application of cyclic mechanical loading, affect solute transport within healthy cartilage tissue. Penetration of fluorescently-tagged solutes was quantified using confocal microscopy. For all solutes tested, fluorescence curves were obtained through the articular surface. On average, diffusivities for the solutes of sizes 200 kDa, 150 kDa, 50 kDa, and 25 kDa were 3.3, 3.4, 5.1, and 6.0 \u00b5m2\/s from 0-100 \u00b5m from the articular surface. Diffusivities went up to a maximum of 16.5, 18.5, 20.5, and 23.4 \u00b5m2\/s for the 200 kDa, 150 kDa, 50 kDa, and 25 kDa molecules, respectively, from 225-325 \u00b5m from the surface. Overall, the effect of loading was very significant, with maximal transport enhancement for each solute ranging from 2.2 to 3.4-fold near 275 \u00b5m. Ultimately, solutes of this size do not diffuse uniformly, nor are convected uniformly, through the depth of the cartilage tissue. This research potentially holds great clinical significance to discover ways of further optimizing transport into cartilage and lead to effective antibody-based treatments for OA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cce","authors":["Chris D.
