Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the main regulators of ECM turnover. TIMPs also have MMP-independent functions. TIMP3 levels are reduced in the heart within 24 hours of MI in mice. We investigated if overexpression of TIMP3 post-MI limits adverse remodeling, LV dilation and dysfunction. MI was induced by LAD ligation in 10-12 weeks old male C57BL\/6J mice, and adenoviral constructs expressing human TIMP3 (Ad-hTIMP3) or no TIMP (Ad-Null) were injected in the peri-infarct zone (5.4x10(7) pfu\/heart, 5 injections\/heart). Cardiac function assessed by echocardiography showed improved LV physiology and reduced LV dilation following TIMP3 overexpression compared to Ad-Null-MI group. Post-MI adverse remodeling was attenuated in Ad-TIMP3-MI group as assessed by greater cardiomyocyte density, less infarct expansion and ECM disruption). TIMP3 overexpression blunted the early rise in proteolytic activities post-MI. A higher density of coronary arteries, and a greater number of proliferating endothelial cells were detected in the infarct and peri-infarct regions in Ad-TIMP3-MI compared to Ad-null-MI group. In vitro 3D angiogenesis assay confirmed that rTIMP3 promotes angiogenesis in human endothelial cells, although biphasically and in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, overexpression of Ad-hTIMP3 at 10-fold higher concentration had no beneficial effects, consistent with anti-angiogenic effects of TIMP3 at higher doses. In conclusion, optimal overexpression of TIMP3 can be a promising therapeutic approach to limit adverse post-MI remodeling by dually inhibiting early proteolysis and promoting angiogenesis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002210","authors":["Abhijit Takawale","Pu Zhang","Abul Azad","Wang Wang","Xiuhua Wang","Allan G.
