This situation has led scholars and practitioners in the field of deafness to question whether the original intent of creating this system has been realized and if there is an adequate research base to support the use of Cued Speech in developing English reading abilities. The purpose of this review was to examine the available research to determine whether there is evidence available to address the persistent questions about Cued Speech and English. Information from four areas of literature was reviewed and summarized, with converging findings from the available data sources revealing support for the role Cued Speech plays in developing reading abilities in English. Limitations of the current literature base and directions for future research are explored.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a24","authors":["Trezek, Beverly J."],"doi":"10.1093\/deafed\/enx026","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T20:40:55+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1081-4159","1465-7325"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Deaf Studies & Deaf Education","last_mentioned_on":1502291460,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jdsde\/article\/doi\/10.1093\/deafed\/enx026\/4079921\/Cued-Speech-and-the-Development-of-Reading-in?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jdsde\/article-pdf\/doi\/10.1093\/deafed\/enx026\/19489542\/enx026.pdf","pmid":"28961870","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press (OUP)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Education","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Health Professions"],"subjects":["audiology","education"],"title":"Cued Speech and the Development of Reading in English: Examining the Evidence","type":"article","volume":"22"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":5.08,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":1612045,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6715669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178761,"mean":12.372738230029,"rank":43214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":134916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178761,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":411,"mean":4.1488536585366,"rank":81,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":326,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":411,"percentile":79},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":5.165,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Cued Speech and the Development of Reading in English: Examining the Evidence","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2017\/journal-article-abstracts\/cued-speech-and-the-development-of-reading-in-english-examining-the-evidence\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[23546384],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T15:11:00+00:00","summary":"&hellip;\nSource:\nCued Speech and the Development of Reading in English: Examining the Evidence\nThe post Cued Speech and the Development of Reading in English: Examining the Evidence was curated by information for practice.","author":{"name":"information for practice","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/","description":"news, new scholarship &amp; more from around the world"}}]}}
