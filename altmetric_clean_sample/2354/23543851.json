In the \u03b2-cell Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchange displays a high capacity, contributes to both Ca(2+) outflow and influx and participates to the control of insulin release. Gain of function studies show that overexpression of PMCA2 or NCX1 leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) depletion with subsequent ER stress, decrease in \u03b2-cell proliferation and \u03b2-cell death by apoptosis. Loss of function studies show, on the contrary, that heterozygous inactivation of NCX1 (Ncx1(+\/-)) leads to an increase in \u03b2-cell function and a 5 fold increase in both \u03b2-cell mass and proliferation. The mutation also increases \u03b2-cell resistance to hypoxia, and Ncx1(+\/-) islets show a 2 to 4 times higher rate of diabetes cure than Ncx1(+\/+) islets when transplanted in diabetic animals. Thus, down-regulation of the Na(+)\/Ca(2+) exchanger leads to various changes in \u03b2-cell function that are opposite to the major abnormalities seen in diabetes. In addition, the \u03b2-cell includes the mutually exclusive exon B in the alternative splicing region of NCX1, which confers a high sensitivity of its NCX splice variants (NCX1.3 & 1.7) to the inhibitory action of compounds like KBR-7943. Heterozygous inactivation of PMCA2 leads to apparented, though not completely similar results.These provide 2 unique models for the prevention and treatment of \u03b2-cell dysfunction in diabetes and following islet transplantation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ac","authors":["Herchuelz, Andr\u00e9","Pachera, Nathalie"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neulet.2017.08.009","first_seen_on":"2017-08-09T17:25:25+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0304-3940","03043940"],"journal":"Neuroscience Letters","last_mentioned_on":1502299512,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0304394017306468"],"pmid":"28780165","pubdate":"2017-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The Na + \/Ca 2+  exchanger and the Plasma Membrane Ca 2+ -ATPase in \u03b2-cell function and diabetes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nasupsupcasup2sup-exchanger-plasma-membrane-casup2supatpase-%CE%B2cell-function-diabetes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8348788,"mean":7.0413328717018,"rank":7217853,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8348788,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":178760,"mean":12.372844365878,"rank":146257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":178760,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3199,"mean":3.7040681676048,"rank":2552,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3199,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":2.7838709677419,"rank":42,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Unspecified":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/PancreaticCell\/statuses\/895335164091310081","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[23543851],"posted_on":"2017-08-09T17:25:12+00:00","author":{"name":"Pancreatic Cell News","url":"http:\/\/www.pancreaticcellnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748297284094304256\/Lh_zVFMn_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the pancreatic community.
