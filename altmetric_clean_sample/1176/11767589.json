During their epididymal transit spermatozoa gain ability for progressive movement and fertilization. The epididymis is composed of several segments that have distinct gene expression profiles which enables establishment of the changing luminal environment required for sperm maturation. The epididymal gene expression is regulated by endocrine, lumicrine and paracrine factors in a segment-specific manner. Thus, in addition to its importance for male fertility, the epididymis is a valuable model tissue for studying the regulation of gene expression. This review concentrates on recent advances in understanding the androgen, small RNA and epigenetically mediated regulation of segment-specific gene expression in the epididymis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008738","authors":["Petra Sipil\u00e4","Ida Bj\u00f6rkgren"],"doi":"10.1530\/rep-15-0533","endpage":"R99","first_seen_on":"2016-09-05T15:04:05+00:00","issns":["1741-7899"],"issue":"3","journal":"Reproduction","last_mentioned_on":1473629159,"links":["http:\/\/www.reproduction-online.org\/content\/152\/3\/R91"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.reproduction-online.org\/content\/152\/3\/R91.full.pdf","pmid":"27222594","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"R91","subjects":["reproductivemedicine"],"title":"Segment-specific regulation of epididymal gene expression","type":"article","volume":"152","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/segmentspecific-regulation-epididymal-gene-expression"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8360145,"mean":7.0505745135414,"rank":3480707,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4834004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8360145,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252545,"mean":12.453074387037,"rank":96926,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":153572,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252545,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":989,"mean":5.1420809716599,"rank":420,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":563,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":989,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":26.11975,"rank":27,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":2,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Scientists":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"SA":1},"mendeley":{"CL":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ReprodJournal\/statuses\/772812490690486272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[11767589],"posted_on":"2016-09-05T15:03:50+00:00","author":{"name":"Reproduction journal","url":"http:\/\/www.reproduction-online.org","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/903542062792024064\/CFg21Zy0_normal.jpg","description":"A leading journal in #reproduction biology.
