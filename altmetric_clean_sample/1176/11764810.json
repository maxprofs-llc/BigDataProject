A thematic analysis was performed.\nMost patients and therapists agreed that helpful aspects in schema therapy were the highly committed therapeutic relationship, the transparent and clear theoretical model, and the specific schema therapy techniques. About unhelpful aspects, several patients and some therapists shared the opinion that 50 sessions was not enough. Furthermore, patients lacked clear advance information about the possibility that they might temporarily experience stronger emotions during therapy and the possibility of having telephone contact outside session hours. They missed practical goals in the later stage of therapy. With regard to imagery, patients experienced time pressure and they missed a proper link between the past and the present. For therapists, it was hard to manage the therapeutic relation, to get used to a new kind of therapy and to keep the treatment focused on personality problems.\nPatients and therapists found some aspects of the schema therapy protocol helpful. Their views about which aspects are unhelpful and their recommendations need to be taken into consideration when adjusting the protocol and implementing schema therapy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023ac","authors":["Noor de Klerk","Tineke A.
