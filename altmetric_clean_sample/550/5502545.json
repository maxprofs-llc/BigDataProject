The recombinant is stable, infectious and replicates in tissue culture at the same rate and to the same titer as standard vaccinia virus. This size flexibility of the poxvirus genome and the lack of stringent packaging requirements are useful features for an infectious eukaryotic cloning vector.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002932","authors":["Smith, G L","Moss, B","Geoffrey L.
