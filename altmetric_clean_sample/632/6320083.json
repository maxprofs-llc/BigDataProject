We studied the incorporation of EF and SDH in the curricula of several universities in Colombia to identify opportunities to strengthen their inclusion.\nQualitative methodology was performed in two stages: (i) initial exploration (self-administered questionnaires and review of curricula) and (ii) validation of the information (semi-structured interviews).\nThe inclusion of the EF and SDH in university curricula is regarded as an opportunity to address social problems. This approach addresses a broad cross-section of the curriculum, especially in the subjects of public health and Primary Health Care (PHC), where community outreach generates greater internalization by students. The dominance of the biomedical model of study plans and practice scenarios focusing on disease and little emphasis on community outreach are factors that limit the inclusion of the approach.\nThe inclusion of EF and SDH in university curricula in Colombia has primarily focused on increasing the knowledge of various subjects oriented towards understanding the social dynamics or comprehensiveness of health and disease and, in some programmes, through practical courses in community health and PHC. Increased integration of EF and SDH in subjects or modules with clinical orientation is recommended.","altmetric_jid":"55c35c2e2a83ee85598b4567","authors":["Hern\u00e1ndez-Rinc\u00f3n, Erwin H","Pimentel-Gonz\u00e1lez, Juan P","Orozco-Beltr\u00e1n, Domingo","Carratal\u00e1-Munuera, Concepci\u00f3n","Erwin H Hern\u00e1ndez-Rinc\u00f3n","Juan P Pimentel-Gonz\u00e1lez","Domingo Orozco-Beltr\u00e1n","Concepci\u00f3n Carratal\u00e1-Munuera"],"doi":"10.1093\/fampra\/cmw010","first_seen_on":"2016-03-24T22:13:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1460-2229","0263-2136"],"issue":"3","journal":"Family Practise","last_mentioned_on":1467666777,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27006409?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/fampra.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/33\/3\/268.short?rss=1"],"pmid":"27006409","pubdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"cmw010","subjects":["primaryhealthcare"],"title":"Inclusion of the equity focus and social determinants of health in health care education programmes in Colombia: a qualitative approach","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inclusion-equity-focus-social-determinants-health-health-care-education-programmes-colombia-qualitat-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":1935832,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":6035420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":279818,"mean":11.111514246811,"rank":87435,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":191439,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":279818,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1011,"mean":6.2604099009901,"rank":399,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":610,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1011,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":6.8387096774194,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":31,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":31}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
