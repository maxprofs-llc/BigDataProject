To achieve this, seedlings of plant were subjected to control, mild stress and severe stress conditions for 30 days. Plant growth, plant water relation, gas exchange, oxidative stress damage, electrolyte leakage rate, mineral content and osmolyte accumulation were measured. Water deficit markedly decreased leaf, stem and root growth. Leaf photosynthetic rate was tremendously reduced by decrease in stomatal conductance under stress conditions. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content markedly increased under mild (82%) and severe (131%) stress conditions, while electrolyte leakage rate (ELR) increased by 59% under mild stress and 3-fold under severe stress. Mineral content in leafwas high in stressed plants, while proline content markedly increased under mild stress (12-fold) and severe stress (15-fold), with corresponding decrease in osmotic potential at full turgor and an increase in osmotic adjustment. These results suggest that maintenance of high mineral content and osmotic adjustment constitute important adaptations in huckleberry under water deficit conditions and that growth depression under drought stress would be mainly caused by increased electrolyte leakage resulting from membrane damage induced by oxidative stress.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6053cf058f610006636","authors":["Assaha, Dekoum Vincent Marius","Liu, Liyun","Ueda, Akihiro","Nagaoka, Toshinori","Saneoka, Hirofumi"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T12:36:30+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0254-8704"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Environmental Biology","last_mentioned_on":1458900609,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26930867?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26930867","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Effects of drought stress on growth, solute accumulation and membrane stability of leafy vegetable, huckleberry (Solanum scabrum Mill.).","type":"article","volume":"37","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effects-drought-stress-growth-solute-accumulation-membrane-stability-leafy-vegetable-huckleberry-sol"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":5629020,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995966,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275777,"mean":11.01723487178,"rank":193911,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42364,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275777,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":120,"mean":1.5123697478992,"rank":63,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":36,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":120,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
