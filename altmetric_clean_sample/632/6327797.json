Examination of 63 patients, using a chain reaction with polymerase (CRP); analysis of length of restriction fragments (CRP-RFLP) and immunohistochemical investigation of gastroduodenal mucosa were performed on the base of a Sumsky Rural Clinical Hospital. Trustworthy difference of distribution of polymorphic genes ESR1 and VKORC1 in patients of both gender in presence of the ulcer hemorrhage was not revealed, excluding genotype A\/A VKORC1, what trustworthy more frequently was revealed in women (p < 0.05). There was established, that intact zone of gastric fundus owes immunoreactivity towards alpha-receptors of estrogen in nuclei of epitheliocytes and stromocytes. Diagnosis of polymorphic gene VKORC1 and expression of the estrogen receptors may serve the base for pathogenetic therapy in patients with hemorrhage occurrence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa91f3cf058f61000d6bb","authors":["Duzhiy, I D","Romanyuk, A M","Lyndin, M C","Bratushka, V V","Dubnytskiy, V Yu","Shevchenko, Yu Yu","Kharchenko, S V"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T12:57:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0023-2130"],"issue":"11","journal":"Klinicheskaia khirurgiia","last_mentioned_on":1458902347,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26939421?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26939421","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"[HORMONAL-GENETIC SCREENING IN PATIENTS, SUFFERING GASTRODUODENAL ULCER HEMORRHAGE].","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hormonalgenetic-screening-patients-suffering-gastroduodenal-ulcer-hemorrhage"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":3826539,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2082316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275777,"mean":11.017254090276,"rank":150212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97585,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275777,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":173,"mean":0.40668604651163,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":173,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":0.75,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":60}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Brianxbio\/statuses\/713314262769229825","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6327797],"posted_on":"2016-03-25T10:39:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Brian Ho","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"Brianxbio","tweeter_id":"215282928","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":54},"tweet_id":"713314262769229825"}]}}
