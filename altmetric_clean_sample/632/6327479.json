Sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E6 antibodies for HPV-driven tumors was evaluated among tumors with known HPV status (n=25).\n63.2% of OPC versus 27.5% of non-OPC cases were HPV16 seropositive; HPV16 E6 seroprevalence was 60.5% and 6.3% respectively, odds ratio 22.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.8-53.1). Sensitivity and specificity of HPV16 E6 antibodies for HPV-driven OPC was 100% [95% CI: 50-100%; n=6] and 100% [95% CI: 60-100%, n=4] compared to 0% (n=2) and 0% (n=13) for non-OPC cases.\nHPV16 antibodies were significantly more common in OPC versus non-OPC cases, particularly HPV16 E6 antibodies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000249a","authors":["Lang Kuhs, Krystle A","Pawlita, Michael","Gibson, Sandra P","Schmitt, Nicole C","Trivedi, Sumita","Argiris, Athanassios","Kreimer, Aim\u00e9e R","Ferris, Robert L","Waterboer, Tim","Krystle A.
