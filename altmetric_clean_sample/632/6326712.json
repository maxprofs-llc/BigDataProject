We compared characteristics and behaviors of MSM who mostly sought sex via the Internet versus traditional venues in a cross-sectional survey among 3588 Chinese MSM. We assessed the sociodemographic predictors and compared high-risk behaviors of using Internet versus traditional venues for sex-finding. Compared to non-Internet MSM, Internet-user MSM were more likely to have been: younger, currently single, better educated, health-insured, with higher income, with Beijing residency ('Hukou'), living longer in the city, HIV-positive, ever using drug and engaging in condomless receptive anal sex. Internet sex-finding users were less likely to be sexually active for longer duration, drink alcohol, drink alcohol before sex, or ever have sex with women. Knowledge of differential characteristics of various sex-finding MSM can help design targeted interventions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f6100056e0","authors":["Liu, Yu","Wang, Juan","Qian, Han-Zhu","Liu, Hongjie","Yin, Lu","Lu, Hongyan","Zhang, Chen","Ruan, Yuhua","Shao, Yiming","Vermund, Sten H"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10461-016-1371-4","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T11:45:51+00:00","funders":["niehs","niaid"],"issns":["1573-3254","1090-7165"],"journal":"AIDS & Behavior","last_mentioned_on":1458897367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27000143?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27000143","pubdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Health Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Infectious Diseases","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome","behavioralsciences"],"title":"Seeking Male Sexual Partners via Internet and Traditional Venues among Chinese Men Who Have Sex with Men: Implications for HIV Risk Reduction Interventions","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/seeking-male-sexual-partners-via-internet-traditional-venues-among-chinese-men-sex-men-implications"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":5629010,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":996026,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275776,"mean":11.017235659505,"rank":193904,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42386,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275776,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1662,"mean":4.2494894641782,"rank":1432,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":115,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1662,"percentile":6},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88,"mean":7.0599770114943,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Mathematics":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/autotwollow\/statuses\/713293374455828480","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6326712],"posted_on":"2016-03-25T09:16:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Martha","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1IBb","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1099613290\/f89f4_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"autotwollow","tweeter_id":"176697548","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":2938},"tweet_id":"713293374455828480"}]}}
