Patients were divided into two treatment groups: 1) combined orbital radiotherapy and steroid pulse therapy (SRT group) and 2) steroid pulse therapy only (ST group). Primary outcome measures included clinical activity score (CAS); NOSPECS classification; ocular motility impairment; and exophthalmos at 1, 3, 6, and 12\u00a0months after treatment. The secondary outcome measure was the change in orbital, extraocular muscle (EOM), and fat volume after treatment measured by orbit computed tomography.\nSixty-eight patients were included in the SRT group, and 59 patients were in the ST group. In both treatments, CAS and NOSPECS were significantly reduced. In the comparison of the degree of change from baseline between the groups, the SRT group demonstrated more improvement in NOSPECS and scores of ocular motility. Orbital, EOM, and fat volume significantly decreased in the SRT group; however, only fat volume was reduced in the ST group. Compressive optic neuropathy after treatment developed in 0\u00a0% of the SRT group and 3.4\u00a0% (2\/59) of the ST group. Reactivation of inflammation occurred in 11.8\u00a0% (8\/68) of the SRT group and 28.8\u00a0% (17\/59) of the ST group.\nOrbital radiotherapy in combination with steroid treatment significantly improved ocular motility by reducing EOM volume in patients with active GO.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ec3cf058f610002982","authors":["Ji Won Kim","Sun Hyup Han","Byeong Jae Son","Tyler Hyungtaek Rim","Ki Chang Keum","Jin Sook Yoon"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00417-016-3280-7","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T07:52:46+00:00","issns":["1435-702X"],"journal":"Graefe's Archive of Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1458691200,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00417-016-3280-7"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00417-016-3280-7.pdf","pmid":"26876240","pubdate":"2016-02-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Ophthalmology","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Efficacy of combined orbital radiation and systemic steroids in the management of Graves\u2019 orbitopathy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/efficacy-combined-orbital-radiation-systemic-steroids-management-graves-orbitopathy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7424901,"mean":6.4566625821178,"rank":3817720,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2078749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7424901,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275664,"mean":11.013160815923,"rank":150101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":97657,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275664,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":635,"mean":1.7039873817035,"rank":201,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":635,"percentile":56},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":3.3847222222222,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":48}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":10}}}},"posts":{"f1000":[{"title":"Recommended in F1000 Prime","url":"https:\/\/f1000.com\/prime\/726148766","license":"public","citation_ids":[6325337],"posted_on":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","f1000_classes":["confirmation"],"f1000_score":"2"}]}}
