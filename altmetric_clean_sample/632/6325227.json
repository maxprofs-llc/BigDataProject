In this study, we report the case of a superior mesenteric artery aneurysm (SMAA) secondary to a bioprosthetic valve endocarditis, successfully managed with aneurysm resection and saphenous vein interposition graft. We performed an extensive PubMed-based rewiew of the literature of the last 10 years on SMAA, which include the detection of 38 articles quoting 41 SMAAs. The case histories were divided in 2 groups: 18 cases belonged to nonmycotic group A and 23 cases were included in mycotic group B. In group A, 44.4% of patients were treated surgically, whereas in group B, 90.5%. The 2 study groups significantly differed (P = .01) in terms of surgical treatment. The surgical approach still remains the first choice of treatment in mycotic aneurysm.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ed","authors":["Alessandro de Troia","Francesca Mottini","Lukla Biasi","Matteo Azzarone","Tiziano Tecchio","PierFranco Salcuni"],"doi":"10.1177\/1538574415627867","endpage":"93","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T07:36:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1938-9116"],"issue":"2","journal":"Vascular & Endovascular Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1463587379,"links":["http:\/\/ves.sagepub.com\/content\/50\/2\/88.abstract","http:\/\/ves.sagepub.com\/content\/50\/2\/88.full.pdf%20html?utm_source=SAGE_social&hootPostID=03d66c11873fcec626b13339d0d04f16"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/ves.sagepub.com\/content\/50\/2\/88.full.pdf","pmid":"26983666","pubdate":"2016-03-16T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"88","subjects":["generalsurgery","cardiology"],"title":"Superior Mesenteric Artery Aneurysm Caused by Aortic Valve Endocarditis: The Case Report and Review of the Literature","type":"article","volume":"50","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/superior-mesenteric-artery-aneurysm-caused-aortic-valve-endocarditis-case-report-review-literature"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7715105,"mean":6.6184650148513,"rank":5833677,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1041475,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7715105,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":278561,"mean":11.06591575962,"rank":196184,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":41914,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":278561,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":207,"mean":1.4800776699029,"rank":99,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":207,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":0.62368421052632,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer > Senior Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Business, Management and Accounting":1}}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Superior Mesenteric Artery Aneurysm Caused by Aortic Valve Endocarditis","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1693400587574307&id=1454028674844834","license":"public","citation_ids":[6325227],"posted_on":"2016-03-23T09:02:00+00:00","summary":"Infectious aneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery are a rare but life-threatening condition due to the risk of visceral ischemia, sepsis, or hemorrhage.
