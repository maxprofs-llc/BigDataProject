They induce programmed cell death and direct the release of danger signals and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. The concerted actions of inflammasomes are of utmost importance for responding adequately to harmful environmental agents and infections. However, deregulated inflammasome signaling is increasingly linked to a diversity of human pathologies, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rare, hereditary periodic fever syndromes. In this review, we discuss recent insight in the protective and detrimental roles of inflammasomes in selected infectious, autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and cover clinically approved therapies that interfere with inflammasome signaling. These findings highlight the importance of fine-balancing the Ying and Yang activities of inflammasomes for sustained homeostasis and suggest that further understanding of inflammasome mechanisms may offer new cures for human diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5143cf058f61000350c","authors":["Saavedra, Pedro H V","Demon, Dieter","Van Gorp, Hanne","Lamkanfi, Mohamed","Pedro H.
