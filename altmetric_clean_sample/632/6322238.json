While many are asymptomatic, some cause symptoms and warrant surgical treatment. In this prospective population-based study, we aimed to study the short- and long-term outcome after surgical intervention in children with arachnoid cysts referred to our centre.\nTwenty-seven pediatric patients (13 f. 14 m, mean age 9.4\u00a0years) with de novo cysts were consecutively included during a 5-year period. The presenting symptoms were headache (n\u00a0=\u00a012), balance disturbance and dizziness (n\u00a0=\u00a06), seizures (n\u00a0=\u00a06), hydrocephalus (n\u00a0=\u00a05), and macrocephaly (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Twenty-two patients underwent surgical treatment with either microsurgical (n\u00a0=\u00a017) or endoscopic fenestration (n\u00a0=\u00a05) of the cyst wall. Cyst volume was measured with OsiriX\u00ae software pre- and postoperatively. Short-term and long-term follow-up of all patients was conducted 3\u00a0months and 8.6\u00a0years (7-10.5\u00a0years) postoperatively.\nThree months after surgery, 59\u00a0% of the patients were improved regarding at least one major complaint, and average cyst volume was reduced to 33.3\u00a0ml (0-145\u00a0ml). At the long-term follow-up of 8.6\u00a0years, 77\u00a0% of the patients were improved regarding at least one symptom but subjective symptoms remained in 59\u00a0%. There was no permanent postoperative morbidity. We found no association between radiological reduction of cyst volume and clinical improvement.\nOur findings support a restrictive attitude to surgery for intracranial arachnoid cysts, in the absence of objectively verified symptoms and signs or obstruction of CSF pathways.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f610002511","authors":["Rabiei, Katrin","H\u00f6gfeldt, Mats Johansson","Doria-Medina, Roberto","Tisell, Magnus","Katrin Rabiei","Mats Johansson H\u00f6gfeldt","Roberto Doria-Medina","Magnus Tisell"],"doi":"10.1007\/s00381-016-3064-8","endpage":"1263","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T01:19:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1433-0350","0256-7040"],"issue":"7","journal":"Child's Nervous System","last_mentioned_on":1474147631,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27000761?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00381-016-3064-8"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs00381-016-3064-8.pdf","pmid":"27000761","pubdate":"2016-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosurgery","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1257","subjects":["neurology","pediatrics"],"title":"Surgery for intracranial arachnoid cysts in children\u2014a prospective long-term study","type":"article","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/surgery-intracranial-arachnoid-cysts-childrena-prospective-longterm-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8392157,"mean":7.0686031077041,"rank":4235086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3940978,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8392157,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":282712,"mean":11.287828651874,"rank":142978,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":129066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":282712,"percentile":45},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1040,"mean":1.8921655437921,"rank":289,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":69,"this_scored_higher_than":725,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1040,"percentile":69},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":65,"mean":0.66484375,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":58,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":65,"percentile":89}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
