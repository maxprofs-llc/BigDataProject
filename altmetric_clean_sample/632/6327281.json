The activity of the new compounds against several restriction enzymes was examined. The studied compounds did not block GC-rich sequences regions of DNA but inhibited catalytic action of endonucleases in AA, AT, TT and AG restriction sites. Determination of association constants using calf thymus DNA, T4 coliphage DNA, poly(dA-dT)\u2082 and poly(dG-dC)\u2082 have confirmed that the tested compounds bind within minor groove of B-DNA. All of the compounds demonstrated activity against DNA topoisomerases II at the concentration 10 \u00b5M, but they did not inhibit activity of topoisomerase I. The studied derivatives were evaluated in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and showed antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in the range of 81.70 \u00b5M and 200.00 \u00b5M.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9153cf058f61000cef6","authors":["Drozdowska, Danuta","Rusak, Ma\u0142gorzata","Miltyk, Wojciech","Markowska, Agnieszka","Samczuki, Przemys\u0142aw"],"first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T12:31:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0001-6837"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta poloniae pharmaceutica","last_mentioned_on":1458900367,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27008800?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27008800","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS ON BREAST CANCER CELLS AND SOME INTERACTIONS OF NEW DISTAMYCIN ANALOGUES WITH DNA, ENDONUCLEASES AND DNA TOPOISOMERASES.","type":"article","volume":"73","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sedation-analgesia-minor-pediatric-procedures"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":5629016,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995993,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275777,"mean":11.01722218032,"rank":193909,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":42376,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275777,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103,"mean":2.5783529411765,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":42,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":1.05,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":33}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Physics and Astronomy":1,"Nursing and Health Professions":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/713305958500315137","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6327281],"posted_on":"2016-03-25T10:06:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":717},"tweet_id":"713305958500315137"}]}}
