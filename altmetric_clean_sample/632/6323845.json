Although the website is designed and aimed at patients and the public, a significant number of respondents were health-care professionals (47%). The majority of survey participants found the Lab Tests Online-UK website via a search engine and were visiting the site for themselves. The majority of participants found what they were looking for on the website and found the information very easy or fairly easy to understand. The patient respondents were keen to see their laboratory test results (87%), but the majority did not have access (60%) at the time of the survey.\nThis survey provides good evidence that the Lab Tests Online-UK website is a useful resource for patients and health-care professionals alike. It comes at a poignant time as the release of results direct to patients starts with access to their medical records. The Lab Tests Online-UK website has a key role in enabling patients to understand their lab test results, and therefore empowering them to take an interest and engage in their own healthcare.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002272","authors":["R Leyland","DB Freedman"],"doi":"10.1177\/0004563216631774","first_seen_on":"2016-03-25T05:10:39+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-1001"],"journal":"Annals of Clinical Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1458881664,"links":["http:\/\/acb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/24\/0004563216631774.abstract?rss=1"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/acb.sagepub.com\/content\/early\/2016\/03\/24\/0004563216631774.full.pdf","pmid":"27013742","pubdate":"2016-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Biochemistry And Metabolomics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"A survey of Lab Tests Online-UK users: a key resource for patients to empower and help them understand their laboratory test results","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/survey-lab-tests-onlineuk-users-key-resource-empower-help-them-understand-laboratory-test-results"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7438587,"mean":6.4662340552314,"rank":6442622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7438587,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":275776,"mean":11.017219523162,"rank":233383,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":275776,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":379,"mean":1.999328042328,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":379,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":28,"mean":0.72592592592593,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":28,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
