In addition to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, MetS has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction. The goal of this study was to assess whether cognitive differences exist between minority urban adolescents carrying excess weight who meet criteria for MetS as compared to their peers without MetS. Two hundred and ninety-six urban adolescents, predominantly Hispanic and carrying excess weight as defined by a BMI above 25\u2009kg\/m(2), were screened for MetS and divided into MetS and no MetS groups. All participants completed the CNS Vital Signs (CNS-VS) computerized neurocognitive battery that assesses cognitive domains of Memory, Processing Speed, Reaction Time, Executive Function, Complex Attention, and Cognitive Flexibility. The MetS group (29.2%, n\u2009=\u200984) performed significantly lower on 2 of the 7 cognitive domains: Executive Function (EF) and Cognitive Flexibility. Additionally, waist circumference was determined to be a significant predictor of both these domains. These findings suggest EF is negatively impacted in adolescents with MetS, despite there being no statistical differences between MetS groups on most other measured cognitive domains. Due to the interrelated nature of obesity, waist circumference, and MetS, these findings have larger implications for the obesity epidemic as well.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f610001467","authors":["Alexander Mangone","Kathy F.
