In young patients, renal causes (glomerulonephritis) and coarctation of the aorta should be considered. In older patients, primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnoea and renal artery stenosis are more prevalent than previously thought. Primary aldosteronism can be screened by taking morning aldosterone and renin levels, and should be considered in patients with severe, resistant or hypokalaemia-associated hypertension. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea should be sought. Worsening of renal function after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests the possibility of renal artery stenosis. Recognition, diagnosis and treatment of secondary causes of hypertension lead to good clinical outcomes and the possible reversal of end-organ damage, in addition to blood pressure control. As most patients with hypertension are managed at the primary care level, it is important for primary care physicians to recognise these conditions and refer patients appropriately.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f610008939","authors":["TH Puar","Y Mok","R Debajyoti","J Khoo","CH How","AK Ng"],"doi":"10.11622\/smedj.2016087","first_seen_on":"2017-04-07T11:46:54+00:00","issns":["00375675"],"issue":"5","journal":"Singapore Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1491565600,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27211205?dopt=Abstract"],"pmcid":"PMC4876411","pmid":"27211205","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Secondary hypertension in adults","type":"article","volume":"57","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/secondary-hypertension-adults"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8002981,"mean":6.7515998143141,"rank":6924542,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8002981,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":235177,"mean":12.877426625166,"rank":192079,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":235177,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":348,"mean":2.7744207492795,"rank":251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":348,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.3125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":6,"Student  > Bachelor":2,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SleepResearch_\/statuses\/850313875958484992","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[18587027],"posted_on":"2017-04-07T11:46:40+00:00","author":{"name":"Sleep Research","url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sleep-Research\/105093012946768?ref=hl","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2694954403\/9f320ff3ac0d13ed3582e204a8c1c768_normal.jpeg","description":"Highlights and news from the latest research on sleep","id_on_source":"SleepResearch_","tweeter_id":"868205960","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1618},"tweet_id":"850313875958484992"}]}}
