The primary outcome was overall surgical site infection, defined using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. Secondary outcomes were superficial or deep surgical site infection and endometritis. Quality of studies and heterogeneity were assessed using validated measures. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were estimated for outcomes with significant reduction.\nWe found no randomized controlled trials. Fourteen preintervention and postintervention studies met inclusion criteria. Eight were full-text articles, and six were published abstracts. Quality of most of the primary studies was adequate with regard to the intervention, but modest in terms of implementation. The rate of surgical site infection was significantly lower after implementing an evidence-based bundle (14 studies: pooled rates 6.2% baseline compared with 2.0% intervention, pooled RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.43, number needed to treat=24). Evidence-based bundles were also associated with a lower rate of superficial or deep surgical site infection (six studies: pooled rate 5.9% baseline compared with 1.1% intervention, pooled RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.12-0.32, number needed to treat=21). The rate of endometritis was low at baseline and not significantly different after intervention (six studies: pooled rate 1.3% baseline compared with 0.9% intervention, pooled RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.31-1.06).\nEvidence-based bundles are associated with a significant reduction in surgical site infection after cesarean delivery.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f610003224","authors":["Carter, Ebony B.","Temming, Lorene A.","Fowler, Susan","Eppes, Catherine","Gross, Gilad","Srinivas, Sindhu K.","Macones, George A.","Colditz, Graham A.","Tuuli, Methodius G."],"doi":"10.1097\/aog.0000000000002249","first_seen_on":"2017-09-23T07:38:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0029-7844"],"issue":"4","journal":"Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1506152281,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/Evidence_Based_Bundles_and_Cesarean_Delivery.11.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/2017\/10000\/Evidence_Based_Bundles_and_Cesarean_Delivery.11.pdf","pmid":"28885421","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"735","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Evidence-Based Bundles and Cesarean Delivery Surgical Site Infections","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/greenjournal\/Fulltext\/2017\/10000\/Evidence_Based_Bundles_and_Cesarean_Delivery.11.aspx","volume":"130","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidencebased-bundles-cesarean-delivery-surgical-site-infections"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":1,"1m":1,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":4517962,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2355249,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116538,"mean":11.750983962175,"rank":62787,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":41528,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116538,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4827,"mean":11.175567757978,"rank":3821,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":697,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4827,"percentile":14},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":53,"mean":11.205961538462,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":53,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/canalmaro\/statuses\/911494848544419840","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26469067],"posted_on":"2017-09-23T07:38:01+00:00","author":{"name":"candido martinez","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489572106242252800\/LLq4f5Jh_normal.jpeg","description":"M\u00e9dico venezolano","id_on_source":"canalmaro","tweeter_id":"66237157","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":560},"tweet_id":"911494848544419840"}]}}
