Self-reported personality characteristics scored as feminine of trans women were not statistically different from those of their cisgender sisters, but were significantly higher than self-reported femininity scores of trans men, genderqueer individuals, and cisgender brothers. Self-reported personality characteristics scored as masculine of trans men did not differ significantly from those of their cisgender brothers, but were higher than those of trans women. Trans men and cisgender brothers were viewed by their siblings in a more sex-typed way than they rated themselves, whereas trans women and cisgender sisters were rated by their siblings in a less sex-typed way than they viewed themselves.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013cc","authors":["Rhonda J.
