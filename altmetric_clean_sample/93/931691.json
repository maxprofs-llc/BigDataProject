Pomegranate is rich in polyphenols with the potent antioxidant activity and inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and promotes apoptosis in various cancer cells. This study demonstrated that pomegranate fruit juice could effectively hinder the proliferation of human prostate cancer DU145 cell. The results of apoptotic analyses implicated that fruit juice might trigger the apoptosis in DU145 cells via death receptor signaling and mitochondrial damage pathway. In this study, we exploited 2DE-based proteomics to compare nine pairs of the proteome maps collected from untreated and treated DU145 cells to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Comparative proteomics indicated that 11 proteins were deregulated in affected DU145 cells with three upregulated and eight downregulated proteins. These dys-regulated proteins participated in cytoskeletal functions, antiapoptosis, proteasome activity, NF-\u03baB signaling, cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Western immunoblotting were implemented to confirm the deregulated proteins and the downstream signaling proteins. The analytical results of this study help to provide insight into the molecular mechanism of inducing prostate cancer cell apoptosis by pomegranate fruit juice and to develop a novel mechanism-based chemopreventive strategy for prostate cancer.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6353cf058f610008649","doi":"10.1002\/pmic.201200084","first_seen_on":"2012-09-06T13:14:14+00:00","issns":["1615-9861"],"journal":"PROTEOMICS","last_mentioned_on":1471478491,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22945439"],"pmid":"22945439","pubdate":"2012-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Proteomic exploration of the impacts of pomegranate fruit juice on the global gene expression of prostate cancer cell.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/proteomic-exploration-impacts-pomegranate-fruit-juice-global-gene-expression-prostate-cancer-cell"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8243836,"mean":6.9683207276644,"rank":3464470,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4727396,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8243836,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100786,"mean":5.9949305352979,"rank":36897,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":63145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100786,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2021,"mean":2.8465603960396,"rank":634,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":1351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2021,"percentile":66},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":26,"mean":1.044,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":24,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":26,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":6},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Social Sciences":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":5,"Nursing and Health Professions":2,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"IN":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/mariettelobo\/statuses\/243600850029776896","license":"public","citation_ids":[931691],"posted_on":"2012-09-06T06:45:43+00:00","author":{"name":"Mariette Lobo","url":"http:\/\/www.mariettelobo.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3494508341\/93cb1c6c526057c810dc8df63d576b8d_normal.jpeg","description":"Complementary medicine therapist\/lecturer - passionate about raising awareness of CAM.
