Family-based tests that condition on parental genotypes or their sufficient statistics are immune to biases due to PS, but are known to have low power, particularly for unselected samples. Population-based approaches that use all available data are an attractive alternative, but the methods have not been evaluated for continuous outcomes when a sample has both family and PS. Therefore, we compare through simulation the performance of population-based regression models that account for family and PS with continuous outcomes using a range of family sizes and structures, including two and three generational families with admixed and discrete PS. We find that when computation time is a concern, the Dupuis et al. efficient score test performs very well. When computational time is not an issue, a linear mixed effects model adjusting for genetic principal components tends to have slightly better power than the score test and may be preferred.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f61000751e","authors":["Peloso, Gina M.","Dupuis, Jos\u00e9e","Lunetta, Kathryn L."],"doi":"10.1002\/gepi.20590","endpage":"436","first_seen_on":"2012-09-07T19:47:59+00:00","isbns":[],"issns":["1098-2272","0741-0395"],"issue":"6","journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","last_mentioned_on":1347047231,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.20590\/full"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/gepi.20590\/pdf","pmid":"21618600","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"427","subjects":["epidemiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Evaluation of methods accounting for population structure with pedigree data and continuous outcomes","type":"article","volume":"35","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluation-methods-accounting-population-structure-pedigree-data-continuous-outcomes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6380092,"mean":5.985707906047,"rank":2812964,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":3397327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6380092,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86180,"mean":5.810141264113,"rank":37826,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":45548,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86180,"percentile":52},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":333,"mean":2.4987831325301,"rank":145,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":333,"percentile":52},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.375,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
