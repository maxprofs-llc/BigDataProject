NVG is also remarked as an 'end stage' of ocular diseases. Conventional treatments with extremely uncontrolled cases are retinal cryotherapy or enucleation. Currently, management of this medical condition is directed toward a new era with great advancement in diagnosis and treatment. Glaucoma drainage implant surgery brings a time window of normal range of intraocular pressure (IOP) for physicians to process underlying disease of NVG. Regression of iris neovascularization by employing panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibodies create a chance to undertaken antiglaucomatous surgery. Adjunctive anti-VEGF treatment promotes the surgical success rate for NVG. Current approaches in NVG are able to provide patients with an individualized management using a sound treatment strategy according to etiology, stage of disease, visual potential and other factors.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000d999","first_seen_on":"2012-09-05T11:42:34+00:00","issns":["0412-4081"],"issue":"6","journal":"[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1346845334,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22943801?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22943801","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"[Current approaches in neovascular glaucoma].","type":"article","volume":"48"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5038248,"mean":5.9640871386398,"rank":4207030,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5038248,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81325,"mean":5.6811669617825,"rank":67224,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81325,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":71,"mean":0.58214285714286,"rank":33,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":71,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.58333333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/VEGFRSSfeeds\/statuses\/243313084368838656","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[930068],"posted_on":"2012-09-05T11:42:14+00:00","author":{"name":"VEGF RSS Feeds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516588600\/VEGF_normal.jpg","id_on_source":"VEGFRSSfeeds","tweeter_id":"88511740","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":363},"tweet_id":"243313084368838656"}]}}
