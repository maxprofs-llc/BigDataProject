The complexity and heterogeneity of the molecular structure, complicated manufacturing process, different analytical methods, and possibility of severe immunogenicity reactions make quantitative evaluation of follow-on biologics a great challenge to both scientific community and regulatory agencies. In this article, we propose a general approach for development of a biosimilarity index based on the concept of reproducibility probability for quantitative evaluation of biosimilarity and interchangeability. The proposed method is robust regardless the biosimilarity criteria used and\/or study design employed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6383cf058f610008a29","authors":["Chow SC","Yang LY","Starr A","Chiu ST","Chow, Shein\u2010Chung","Yang, Lan\u2010Yan","Starr, Aijing","Chiu, Shih\u2010Ting","Shein-Chung Chow","Lan-Yan Yang","Aijing Starr","Shih-Ting Chiu"],"doi":"10.1002\/sim.5566","endpage":"448","first_seen_on":"2012-09-07T06:54:02+00:00","issns":["1097-0258","0277-6715","02776715"],"issue":"3","journal":"Statistics in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1347000824,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/sim.5566\/abstract;jsessionid=6478AC16592F349779D58BC283B2534D.d01t03?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/sim.5566\/pdf","pmid":"22899372","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Statistics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Physical Sciences","Mathematics"],"startpage":"442","subjects":["statisticsastopic"],"title":"Statistical methods for assessing interchangeability of biosimilars","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/sim.5566","volume":"32","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/statistical-methods-assessing-interchangeability-biosimilars"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7360980,"mean":6.3957107697188,"rank":6366314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7360980,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97042,"mean":5.6760567182943,"rank":78603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97042,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1955,"mean":2.3666356192426,"rank":1828,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1955,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.0810769230769,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Ph.
