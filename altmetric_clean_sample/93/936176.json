Here, we show that siRNA-mediated loss of calsyntenin-1 in cultured neurons alters APP processing to increase production of A\u03b2. We also show that calsyntenin-1 is reduced in Alzheimer's disease brains and that the extent of this reduction correlates with increased A\u03b2 levels. Calsyntenin-1 is a ligand for kinesin-1 light chains and APP is transported through axons on kinesin-1 molecular motors. Defects in axonal transport are an early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease and defective APP transport is known to increase A\u03b2 production. We show that calsyntenin-1 and APP are co-transported through axons and that siRNA-induced loss of calsyntenin-1 markedly disrupts axonal transport of APP. Thus, perturbation to axonal transport of APP on calsyntenin-1 containing carriers induces alterations to APP processing that increase production of A\u03b2. Together, our findings suggest that disruption of calsyntenin-1-associated axonal transport of APP is a pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61b3cf058f61000767c","authors":["Vagnoni A","Perkinton MS","Gray EH","Francis PT","Noble W","Miller CC"],"doi":"10.1093\/hmg\/dds109","first_seen_on":"2012-09-08T19:24:36+00:00","funders":["wellcome","mrc"],"issns":["0964-6906","1460-2083"],"issue":"","journal":"Human Molecular Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1346803200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22434822","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1093\/hmg\/dds109"],"pmid":"22434822","pubdate":"2012-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","geneticsmedical"],"title":"Calsyntenin-1 mediates axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein and regulates A\u03b2 production","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/calsyntenin1-mediates-axonal-transport-amyloid-precursor-protein-regulates-a%CE%B2-production"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3627464,"mean":4.9483847763613,"rank":681676,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":2921972,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3627464,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75234,"mean":5.1018046070208,"rank":13693,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":61296,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75234,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3144,"mean":3.488004454343,"rank":381,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":2726,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3144,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.2248484848485,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":76}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
