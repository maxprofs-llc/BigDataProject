To date, many epidemiological studies have been conducted to investigate the incidence of ATL among general population or HTLV-1 carriers and to identify a variety of laboratory, molecular, and host-specific markers to be possible predictive factors for developing ATL because HTLV-1 infection alone is not sufficient to develop ATL. This literature review focuses on the epidemiology of ATL and the risk factors for the development of ATL from HTLV-1 carriers, while keeping information on the epidemiology of HTLV-1 to a minimum. The main lines of epidemiological evidence are: (1) ATL occurs mostly in adults, at least 20-30\u2009years after the HTLV-1 infection, (2) age at onset differs across geographic areas: the average age in the Central and South America (around 40\u2009years old) is younger than that in Japan (around 60\u2009years old), (3) ATL occurs in those infected in childhood, but seldom occurs in those infected in adulthood, (4) male carriers have about a three- to fivefold higher risk of developing ATL than female, (5) the estimated lifetime risk of developing ATL in HTLV-1 carriers is 6-7% for men and 2-3% for women in Japan, (6) a low anti-Tax reactivity, a high soluble interleukin-2 receptor level, a high anti-HTLV-1 titer, and high levels of circulating abnormal lymphocytes and white blood cell count are accepted risk factors for the development of ATL, and (7) a higher proviral load (more than 4 copies\/100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is an independent risk factor for progression of ATL. Nevertheless, the current epidemiological evidence is insufficient to fully understand the oncogenesis of ATL. Further well-designed epidemiological studies are needed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa81f3cf058f61000bc10","authors":["Masako Iwanaga","Toshiki Watanabe","Kazunari Yamaguchi"],"doi":"10.3389\/fmicb.2012.00322","first_seen_on":"2012-09-10T08:25:23+00:00","issns":["1664-302X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Microbiology","last_mentioned_on":1367237706,"links":["http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Virology\/10.3389\/fmicb.2012.00322\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/Journal\/DownloadFile.ashx?pdf=1&FileId=21331&articleId=29018&Version=1&ContentTypeId=21&FileName=fmicb-03-00322.pdf","pmid":"22973265","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Adult T-Cell Leukemia: A Review of Epidemiological Evidence","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/adult-tcell-leukemia-review-epidemiological-evidence-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2168212,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":2799552,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81131,"mean":5.7384106002712,"rank":29237,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":50746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81131,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3540,"mean":3.1817129132523,"rank":1303,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":2198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3540,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
