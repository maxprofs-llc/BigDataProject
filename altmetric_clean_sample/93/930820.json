The resulting helical polymer-metal complex (HPMC) nanospheres present two interesting properties: (a) their diameter can be tuned to different sizes, to growth or to shrink, by changing the metal ion or the polymer\/metal ion ratio, and (b) the helicity on the surface and the interior of the particle can be tuned to any of the two helical senses (M or P) by selection of the metal ion. The role of the solvent, the metal ion, and the helicity of the polymer in the aggregation are discussed. The ability of these nanospheres to encapsulate is demonstrated with examples.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["F\u00e9lix Freire"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja3061112","first_seen_on":"2012-09-05T18:27:42+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1346869037,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja3061112"],"pmid":"22894558","pubdate":"2012-08-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Nanospheres with Tunable Size and Chirality from Helical Polymer\u2013Metal Complexes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nanospheres-tunable-size-chirality-helical-polymermetal-complexes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3544653,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":136052,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":3},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78765,"mean":5.3722978264182,"rank":61957,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":752,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78765,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1151220520773,"rank":12631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":1167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":466,"mean":4.0167440860215,"rank":345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":466,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
