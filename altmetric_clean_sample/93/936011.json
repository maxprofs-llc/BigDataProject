The analysis is performed both with the signal averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) and in real time. A comparison between the temporal and the time-frequency analysis is also reported. In the first analysis the standard parameters QRSd, LAS40, and RMS40 were used; in the second normalized energy in time-frequency domain was calculated. The algorithm was tested adding artificial VLPs to real ECGs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61f3cf058f610007a9d","doi":"10.5402\/2012\/258769","first_seen_on":"2012-09-08T16:36:34+00:00","issns":["2090-5599"],"journal":"ISRN Cardiology","last_mentioned_on":1347122153,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22957271?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22957271","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"A method for ventricular late potentials detection using time-frequency representation and wavelet denoising.","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/method-ventricular-late-potentials-detection-using-timefrequency-representation-wavelet-denoising"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507072,"mean":5.1258131841361,"rank":3082009,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":964167,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507072,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78569,"mean":5.4051471591488,"rank":50886,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":17613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78569,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":1.7688636363636,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":3,"Student  > Bachelor":2},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":3,"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Computer Science":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1},"mendeley":{"TR":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/drkubrusly\/statuses\/244474148410245120","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[936011],"posted_on":"2012-09-08T16:35:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Dr. Kubrusly","url":"http:\/\/portaldacirurgiacardiaca.com.br","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2258162001\/dr-luiz-fernando-kubrusly-avatar_normal.jpg","description":"Twitter oficial do  Dr. Luiz Fernando Kubrusly.\r\nCirurgi\u00e3o Cardiovascular\r\n","id_on_source":"drkubrusly","tweeter_id":"592970242","geo":{"lt":-25.440029,"ln":-49.276691,"country":"BR"},"followers":7},"tweet_id":"244474148410245120"}]}}
