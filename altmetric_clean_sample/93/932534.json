Using a 3T system with optimization of both temporal resolution and k-space subsampling with a combination of parallel imaging and cut-corner acquisition, we present the clinical assessment of a patient with an arteriovenous malformation by providing complete intracranial arterial and venous coverage in a reasonable scan time.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60a3cf058f610006984","authors":["W.P.
