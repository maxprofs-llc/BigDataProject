The wHTH domain resembles the wing like domain found in DNA binding proteins and is situated near to the kinase domain. Ligand binding to this domain may reposition the kinase domain leading to inhibition of enzyme function and could be utilized as a novel allosteric site to design inhibitor. In the present study, we have generated a model of RIO2 kinase from Plasmodium falciparum utilizing multiple modeling, simulation approach. A novel putative DNA-binding site is identified for the first time in PfRIO2 kinase to understand the DNA binding events involving wHTH domain and flexible loop. Induced fit DNA docking followed by minimization, molecular dynamics simulation, energetic scoring and binding mode studies are used to reveal the structural basis of PfRIO2-ATP-DNA complex. Ser105 as a potential site of phosphorylation is revealed through the structural studies of ATP binding in PfRIO2. Overall the present study discloses the structural facets of unknown PfRIO2 complex and opens an avenue toward exploration of novel drug target.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e65","doi":"10.1007\/s00894-012-1572-3","first_seen_on":"2012-09-06T11:46:03+00:00","issns":["0948-5023"],"journal":"Journal of Molecular Modeling","last_mentioned_on":1346930042,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22949065?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22949065","pubdate":"2012-09-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Characterization and Evaluation of Materials","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Appl. in Life Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Computer Applications in Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Molecular Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Theoretical and Computational Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
