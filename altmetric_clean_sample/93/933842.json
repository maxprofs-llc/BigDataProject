Disease stage, progression, and prognosis following treatment appear to be strongly influenced by cytokine and antibody profiles, and more recent evidence has suggested an important role of dendritic cells (DCs) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) in immunomodulation. Microarrays have supported these findings, highlighting both known and novel pathways involved in chronic murine disease. Genetic studies to date have been few and with limited success. Advanced genomic approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), may provide further insight to identify the relevant pathways involved, thereby facilitating a new approach for the development of new clinical therapies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036b3","doi":"10.1016\/j.pt.2012.08.001","first_seen_on":"2012-09-07T10:30:50+00:00","issns":["1471-5007"],"journal":"Trends in Parasitology","last_mentioned_on":1348240472,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22951425?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22951425","pubdate":"2012-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["parasitology"],"title":"Immunogenetics of human echinococcosis.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/immunogenetics-human-echinococcosis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":2122956,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2225856,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78508,"mean":5.4248304991912,"rank":33188,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78508,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":550,"mean":4.0874681238616,"rank":366,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":151,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":550,"percentile":27},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.6772727272727,"rank":16,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
