We report the case of a 40-year-old man with known hereditary angioedema who presented with a sore throat and a sensation of evolving airway obstruction. After a thorough search of the medical literature, we believe this to be the first reported case of angioedema manifesting in the retropharyngeal space. The pathophysiological factors of angioedema are discussed, along with its variable presentation and management issues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005712","authors":["Altman, K W","Woodring, A J","Pappano, J E"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-10T14:12:34+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0196-0709"],"issue":"2","journal":"American Journal of Otolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1347317439,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/10203164"],"pmid":"10203164","pubdate":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology"],"title":"Angioedema presenting in the retropharyngeal space in an adult.","type":"article","volume":"20","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/angioedema-presenting-retropharyngeal-space-adult"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628118,"mean":4.9440792284301,"rank":2904535,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":75318,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628118,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75178,"mean":5.117383933916,"rank":55803,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":342,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75178,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":1.3321428571429,"rank":203,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":3},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.40625,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Other":1,"Unspecified":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":5,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"TR":1,"ES":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"Angioedema presenting in the retrop...
