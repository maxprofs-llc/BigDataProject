In our preceding paper, 214 extracts from 162 plants were screened to elucidate the antiproliferative principles against ATL cell lines. Several withanolides were isolated and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) examined. To extend the search for SAR, 31 further withanolides, previously isolated from solanaceous plants, were tested against ATL cell lines. The presence of a 4\u03b2-hydroxy group as well as a 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxy group appeared to be essential for the activity. In contrast, the presence of a sugar moiety at either the 3- or the 27-position led to a reduction in the activity. Furthermore, 24,25-dihydrowithanolide D (13) was identified as the most potent inhibitor, showing selective toxicity against ATL cell lines by inducing apoptotic cell death.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007d8a","authors":["Daisuke Nakano","Kenji Ishitsuka","Hiroo Katsuya","Naoko Kunami","Rumiko Nogami","Yuka Yoshimura","Michika Matsuda","Mio Kamikawa","Ryota Tsuchihashi","Masafumi Okawa","Tsuyoshi Ikeda","Toshihiro Nohara","Kazuo Tamura","Junei Kinjo"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11418-012-0700-9","first_seen_on":"2012-09-10T22:21:05+00:00","issns":["1340-3443","1861-0293"],"journal":"Journal of Natural Medicines","last_mentioned_on":1347315626,"links":["http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/056qq98nr21g3842\/"],"pmid":"22961603","pubdate":"2012-09-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Complementary & Alternative Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicinal Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacology\/Toxicology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Pharmacy","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Plant Sciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Screening of promising chemotherapeutic candidates from plants against human adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (II): apoptosis of antiproliferactive principle (24,25-dihydrowithanolide D) against ATL cell lines and structure\u2013activity relationships with withanolides isolated from solanaceous plants","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/screening-promising-chemotherapeutic-candidates-plants-against-human-adult-tcell-leukemialymphoma-ii-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":3079149,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":958905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78491,"mean":5.4530513696012,"rank":50627,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":16351,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78491,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":169,"mean":1.0567142857143,"rank":78,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":45,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":169,"percentile":26},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":0.88461538461538,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
