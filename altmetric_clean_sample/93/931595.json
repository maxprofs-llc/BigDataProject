In a RCT, 148 cancer patients agreed to have their consultations audio-recorded and were assigned to the intervention or a control group. The recordings were used to code for patients' questions, acts of assertiveness, and expressed concerns and to rate the quality of physicians' communication.\nPatients in the TEC group discussed their pain concerns more than did patients in the control group. More active patients also had more baseline pain and interacted with physicians using participatory decision-making. Ratings of physicians' information about pain were higher when patients talked more about their pain concerns.\nThe study demonstrates the efficacy of a theoretically grounded, coaching intervention to help cancer patients talk about pain control.\nCoaching interventions can be effective resources for helping cancer patients communicate about their pain concerns if they are theoretically grounded, can be integrated within clinical routines, and lead to improve health outcomes.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032a1","authors":["Kravitz, Richard L."],"doi":"10.1016\/j.pec.2009.10.009","first_seen_on":"2012-09-06T12:57:09+00:00","issns":["0738-3991","1873-5134"],"issue":"1","journal":"Patient Education & Counseling","last_mentioned_on":1442471727,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0738399109004996","http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(09)00499-6\/abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2891619\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.pec-journal.com\/article\/S0738-3991(09)00499-6\/pdf","pmcid":"PMC2891619","pmid":"19962845","pubdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["nursing"],"title":"Improving Physician-Patient Communication About Cancer Pain With a Tailored Education-Coaching Intervention","type":"article","volume":"80","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/improving-physicianpatient-communication-about-cancer-pain-tailored-educationcoaching-intervention"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7991461,"mean":6.73763445002,"rank":3193971,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4740599,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7991461,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99611,"mean":5.804033068969,"rank":34239,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":64567,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99611,"percentile":64},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1744,"mean":4.9482455536431,"rank":983,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":737,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1744,"percentile":42},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":34,"mean":4.7969696969697,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":16,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":34,"percentile":47}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":3,"Researcher":29,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
