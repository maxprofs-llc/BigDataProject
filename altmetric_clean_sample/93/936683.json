There exists a significant gap between health care utilization in rural and urban areas and inequality in health care access due to differences in socioeconomic status is increasing. We investigate inequality in service utilization among the mid-aged and elderly, with a special attention of health insurance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007bb","authors":["Yang Wang","Jian Wang","Elizabeth Maitland","Yaohui Zhao","Stephen Nicholas","Mingshan Lu","Wang Y","Wang J","Maitland E","Zhao Y","Nicholas S","Lu M"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6963-12-302","first_seen_on":"2012-09-09T12:46:38+00:00","issns":["","1472-6963"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Health Services Research","last_mentioned_on":1347194769,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/12\/302\/abstract"],"pmid":"22947369","pubdate":"2012-09-04T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Health Administration","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Health Informatics","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nursing Management\/Nursing Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health\/Gesundheitswesen","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"302","subjects":["healthservicesresearch"],"title":"Growing old before growing rich: inequality in health service utilization among the mid-aged and elderly in Gansu and Zhejiang Provinces, China","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/1472-6963-12-302","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/growing-old-before-growing-rich-inequality-health-service-utilization-among-midaged-elderly-gansu-zh"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628714,"mean":4.9390391673343,"rank":2016686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":937538,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628714,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75191,"mean":5.0994442878042,"rank":35871,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":26786,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75191,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1752,"mean":4.0449023415191,"rank":1162,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1752,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":2.9911546391753,"rank":58,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
