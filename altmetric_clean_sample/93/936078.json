Experiment 1 was designed to determine if magnesium deficiency interfered with the gluconeogenic response to fasting. Rats were fed either a control (C) or magnesium-deficient (MD) diet for 12 days. One-half of each group of rats was fasted for 24 hours prior to death. Hepatic enzyme activities, plasma and liver magnesium, and whole blood glucose were measured. Activities of G6Pase and PEPCK were higher in fasted group C rats compared to fed group C rats. Activity of FDPase was lower. The response was similar in the MD groups. Comparison of C and MD groups indicated that magnesium deficiency was accompanied by an increase in PEPCK activity. To verify this result and to investigate the role of anorexia in producing increased PEPCK activity, experiment 2 included a pair-fed group (PF). The results indicated that anorexia was not responsible for increased PEPCK activity in MD rats. The relation of circulating insulin and glucagon concentrations to effects of magnesium deficiency was explored in experiment 3. A decreased insulin:glucagon ratio was observed in MD rats. The results of these experiments suggest that magnesium deficiency alters PEPCK activity by affecting secretion of pancreatic hormones.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e8d","authors":["McNeill, D A","Herbein, J H","Ritchey, S J"],"first_seen_on":"2012-09-08T18:00:55+00:00","issns":["0022-3166"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Nutrition","last_mentioned_on":1350723993,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/6279807"],"pmid":"6279807","pubdate":"1982-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"title":"Hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes, plasma insulin and glucagon response to magnesium deficiency and fasting.","type":"article","volume":"112","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hepatic-gluconeogenic-enzymes-plasma-insulin-glucagon-response-magnesium-deficiency-fasting"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3616992,"mean":4.9289391557822,"rank":2700014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":871975,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3616992,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75180,"mean":5.118165365328,"rank":48651,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":24751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75180,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2616,"mean":6.7563732313575,"rank":1966,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2616,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":3.4882352941176,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":22}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
