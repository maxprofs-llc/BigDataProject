The study was a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, blinded, non-inferiority design clinical trial comparing robenacoxib to ketoprofen. A total of 68 cats presenting with pain and inflammation associated with acute musculoskeletal disorders were recruited and allocated randomly to receive, orally once daily for 5-6 days, either 1.0-2.4 mg\/kg robenacoxib (n=47) or 1mg\/kg ketoprofen (n=21). The primary efficacy endpoint was the total clinician score, which was the sum of clinician numerical rating scale scores for pain, inflammation and mobility. Assessments were made at baseline, on day 2, and day 4 or 5. For the total clinician score, non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib was demonstrated with a relative efficacy of 1.151 (95% confidence interval 0.872-1.494). Non-inferior efficacy of robenacoxib was also demonstrated for the secondary endpoint of the total owner score. Robenacoxib was superior (P<0.05) to ketoprofen for the owner's assessment of activity and human\/animal relationship. The tolerability of both treatments was good as assessed by monitoring adverse events, clinical signs and haematology and serum biochemistry variables.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036fa","authors":["Sano T","King JN","Seewald W","Sakakibara N","Okumura M"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.tvjl.2012.02.008","first_seen_on":"2012-09-06T12:51:39+00:00","issns":["1090-0233","10900233"],"journal":"Veterinary Journal","last_mentioned_on":1374894982,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1090023312000780"],"pmid":"22430026","pubdate":"2012-03-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Veterinary","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"title":"Comparison of oral robenacoxib and ketoprofen for the treatment of acute pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders in cats: A randomised clinical trial ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparison-oral-robenacoxib-ketoprofen-treatment-acute-pain-inflammation-associated-musculoskeletal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507509,"mean":5.1386389830674,"rank":2125198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2233095,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507509,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78534,"mean":5.4334019838794,"rank":33439,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":42282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78534,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1044,"mean":2.0585407478428,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":661,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1044,"percentile":63},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":1.2093023255814,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":29,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":65}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
