Self-medication among medical students is recognised as a threat to rational prescribing. Antibiotic self-medication could cause antibiotic resistance among medical students. We aimed to find an association between pharmacology education and antibiotic self-medication.\nOverall, 39% [(110\/285) 95% CI 32.9-44.3] of students were found to have antibiotic self-medication. The percentage for antibiotic self-medication progressively increased with the year of study. The percentage of antibiotic self-medication was significantly high in the \"Formal Pharmacology Education\" group (47%-77\/165) in comparison to the \"No Formal Pharmacology Education\" group (28%-33\/120) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001032). Overall, the most common self-prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin (56%-62\/110).","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000798","authors":["Rathish, Devarajan","Wijerathne, Buddhika","Bandara, Sandaruwan","Piumanthi, Susanhitha","Senevirathna, Chamali","Jayasumana, Channa","Siribaddana, Sisira","Devarajan Rathish","Buddhika Wijerathne","Sandaruwan Bandara","Susanhitha Piumanthi","Chamali Senevirathna","Channa Jayasumana","Sisira Siribaddana"],"doi":"10.1186\/s13104-017-2688-4","first_seen_on":"2017-07-29T11:05:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1756-0500"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Research Notes","last_mentioned_on":1501329907,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28750649?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28750649","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biology"],"title":"Pharmacology education and antibiotic self-medication among medical students: a cross-sectional study","type":"article","volume":"10","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pharmacology-education-antibiotic-selfmedication-among-medical-students-crosssectional-study"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8290197,"mean":6.9872012989734,"rank":6290004,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1121499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8290197,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170153,"mean":11.479409163571,"rank":119842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":31197,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170153,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2074,"mean":4.7176507477086,"rank":1422,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2074,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":48,"mean":13.170978723404,"rank":38,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":14,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":48,"percentile":14}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
