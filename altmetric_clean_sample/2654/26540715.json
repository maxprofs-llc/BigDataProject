Quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing B strains from each of the two lineages have been developed for improved prevention of influenza B infections. Here, we describe the results of a phase III, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter trial examining the safety and immunogenicity of a split-virion inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) in 675 adults \u2265 65\u00a0years of age (NCT01218646). Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive a single intramuscular injection with the investigational IIV4, or one of two split-virion trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s): a licensed IIV3 containing a B Victoria-lineage strain or an investigational IIV3 containing a B Yamagata-lineage strain. Post-vaccination (day 21) hemagglutinin inhibition titers to all strains induced by IIV4 were statistically non-inferior to those induced by the two IIV3s. In addition, for each B strain, rates of seroconversion in the IIV4 group were superior to those induced by the comparator IIV3 not containing that B strain. For all vaccines, the most common solicited reaction was injection-site pain, and most reactions were mild to moderate in intensity and transient. Overall safety profiles were similar between IIV4 and the IIV3s, and no vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. These results confirm that in adults \u2265 65\u00a0years of age, IIV4 was well tolerated and immunogenic against the additional B lineage strain without compromising the immunogenicity of the other three vaccine strains.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9343cf058f61000dea9","authors":["David P.
