Survival data with direct-acting antiviral agents are not available. We conducted this study to quantify the effect of paritaprevir\/ritonavir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir (PrOD) and ledipasvir\/sofosbuvir (LDV\/SOF) regimens upon mortality.\nIn the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES), a well-established national cohort of HCV-infected Veterans, we identified HCV-infected persons initiated on PrOD or LDV\/SOF, excluding those with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, hepatocellular carcinoma, or missing HCV RNA or FIB-4 scores. For each case, we identified a propensity score-matched control never initiated on treatment. Primary outcome was survival. Outcomes were assessed using frequency of events, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.\nWe identified 1473 persons on PrOD, 5497 on LDV\/SOF, and 6970 propensity score-matched untreated persons. Treated persons were more likely to be obese and have cirrhosis, but less likely to have stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), alcohol or drug abuse or dependence diagnosis, and anemia. The proportion of persons who died was higher in the untreated group compared with either treatment group (PrOD, 0.3%; LDV\/SOF, 1.4%; untreated controls, 2.5%; P < .001). A significantly larger percentage of treated patients survived to 18 months of follow-up, compared with untreated controls (P < .001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, treatment with either regimen (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], .33-.57) and attainment of sustained virologic response (SVR) were associated with significantly lower mortality (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, .33-.99).\nTreatment with PrOD or LDV\/SOF and SVR are associated with a significant mortality benefit, apparent within the first 18 months of treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000255e","authors":["Butt, Adeel Ajwad","Yan, Peng","Simon, Tracey G","Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi"],"doi":"10.1093\/cid\/cix364","first_seen_on":"2017-09-25T09:41:13+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1058-4838","1537-6591"],"issue":"6","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1506410219,"links":["https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cid\/article\/65\/6\/1006\/3980327\/Effect-of-Paritaprevir-Ritonavir-Ombitasvir"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cid\/article-pdf\/65\/6\/1006\/19634514\/cix364.pdf","pmid":"28903508","pubdate":"2017-09-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"title":"Effect of Paritaprevir\/Ritonavir\/Ombitasvir\/Dasabuvir and Ledipasvir\/Sofosbuvir Regimens on Survival Compared With Untreated Hepatitis C Virus\u2013Infected Persons: Results From ERCHIVES","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-paritaprevirritonavirombitasvirdasabuvir-ledipasvirsofosbuvir-regimens-survival-compared-untr"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.7,"6m":2.7,"3m":2.7,"1m":2.7,"1w":0.85,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462170,"mean":7.1084920520889,"rank":3408102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":5027384,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462170,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116290,"mean":11.520737455821,"rank":37972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":77683,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116290,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8241,"mean":9.3491587378641,"rank":5166,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":37,"this_scored_higher_than":3063,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8241,"percentile":37},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":40,"mean":6.3084615384615,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":18,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":40,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
