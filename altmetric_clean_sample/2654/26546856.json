Postoperative thresholds, speech perception results (word recognition scores, speech reception thresholds, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR]), and quality of life questionnaires at 20 weeks were compared with preoperative results with all patients receiving the same, best available hearing aid (HA).\nStatistically significant improvements in postoperative AMEI-aided thresholds (1, 2, 4, and 8\u200akHz) and on the speech reception thresholds and word recognition scores tests, compared with preoperative HA-aided results, were observed. On the SNR, the subjects' mean values showed statistically significant improvement, with -5.7\u200adB SNR for the AMEI-aided mean and -2.1\u200adB SNR for the preoperative HA-assisted mean. The APHAB quality of life questionnaire also showed statistically significant improvement with the AMEI.\nResults with the AMEI applied to the round window exceeded those of the best available hearing aid in speech perception as well as quality of life questionnaires. There were minimal adverse events or changes to patients' residual hearing.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
