Loco-regional tumor dissemination has been barely described whereas its accurate definition might be useful in terms of prognosis and treatment, especially for radiation therapy planning. Our purpose was therefore to describe MR patterns and prevalence of loco-regional extensions of these tumors.\nOne hundred consecutive patients (median age 16.3\u00a0years, range 7-41\u00a0years, sex ratio 7:1) with a histologically or biologically proven CNS GCT were retrospectively included. Brain and spinal MRI at diagnosis were reviewed by two neuroradiologists focusing on MR patterns of primaries and loco-regional extensions. When available, follow-up MR exams were analyzed.\nPure germinoma represented 84\/100 cases. Primaries were unifocal pineal (n\u00a0=\u00a049\/100), bifocal pineal and supra-sellar (n\u00a0=\u00a027\/100), isolated supra-sellar (n\u00a0=\u00a021\/100), isolated basal ganglia (n\u00a0=\u00a02\/100) or trifocal pineal, supra-sellar, and basal ganglia (n\u00a0=\u00a01\/100). Metastatic disease occurred in 6\/100 patients (depicted by MRI in two and CSF cytology in four). Loco-regional extensions were observed in all patients and classified as follows: third ventricle (n\u00a0=\u00a088\/100), thalamus (n\u00a0=\u00a047\/100), midbrain (n\u00a0=\u00a042\/100), distant sub-ependymal areas (n\u00a0=\u00a019\/100), optic pathways (n\u00a0=\u00a019\/100), lateral ventricles (n\u00a0=\u00a07\/100), cavernous sinus (n\u00a0=\u00a06\/100), corpus callosum (n\u00a0=\u00a04\/100), and fourth ventricle (n\u00a0=\u00a03\/100).\nCNS GCT present with specific loco-regional extensions at diagnosis. Improving their recognition will be helpful to further understand their prognostic value and potentially to optimize the treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031a8","authors":["Lo\u00efc Duron","Flavie Sadones","Philippe Thiesse","C\u00e9cile Cellier","Claire Alapetite","Fran\u00e7ois Doz","Didier Frappaz","Herv\u00e9 J.
