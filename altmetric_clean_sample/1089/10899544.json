We report that cells from longer-lived species exhibit more tumor protein p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci for a given degree of DNA damage relative to shorter-lived species. The presence of a greater number of 53BP1 foci was associated with decreased DNA fragmentation and a lower percentage of cells exhibiting micronuclei. These data suggest that cells from longer-lived species have an enhanced DNA damage response. We propose that the number of 53BP1 foci that form in response to damage reflects the intrinsic capacity of cells to detect and respond to DNA harms.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fab","authors":["Eleonora Croco","Silvia Marchionni","Martine Bocchini","Cristina Angeloni","Thomas Stamato","Claudio Stefanelli","Silvana Hrelia","Christian Sell","Antonello Lorenzini"],"doi":"10.1093\/gerona\/glw170","first_seen_on":"2016-08-30T03:42:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1758-535X"],"journal":"Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences & Medical Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1472579373,"links":["http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/29\/gerona.glw170.short?rss=1&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/biomedgerontology.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/early\/2016\/08\/29\/gerona.glw170.full.pdf","pmid":"27573809","pubdate":"2016-08-31T22:06:49+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["geriatrics"],"title":"DNA Damage Detection by 53BP1: Relationship to Species Longevity","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dna-damage-detection-53bp1-relationship-species-longevity"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8302052,"mean":6.9984430163018,"rank":6003155,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2002707,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8302052,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251587,"mean":12.499541834601,"rank":163963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":73107,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251587,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":9.7267039239001,"rank":1343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":283,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":16},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":26.532107142857,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
