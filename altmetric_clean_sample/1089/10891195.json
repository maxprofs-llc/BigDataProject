Little is known about the process of injury and regeneration of human kidney microvasculature, resulting from the lack of appropriate kidney microvascular models that can incorporate the proper cells, extracellular matrices (ECM) and architectures needed to understand the response and contribution of individual vascular components in these processes. Here, we present methods to recreate the human kidney ECM microenvironment by fabricating kidney ECM (kECM) hydrogels derived from decellularized human kidney cortex. The majority of native matrix proteins, such as collagen-IV, laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan and their isoforms were preserved in similar proportions as found in normal kidneys. Human kidney microvascular endothelial cells (HKMECs) became more quiescent when cultured on this kECM gel compared to culture on collagen-I-assessed using phenotypic, genotypic and functional assays; whereas human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) became stimulated on kECM gels. We demonstrate for the first time that human kidney cortex can form a hydrogel suitable for use in flow-directed microphysiological systems (MPSs). Our findings strongly suggest that selecting the proper extracellular matrix is a critical consideration in the development of vascularized 'organs on a chip' and carries important implications for tissue engineering of all vascularized organs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9b","authors":["Nagao, Ryan Joseph","Xu, Jin","Luo, Ping","Xue, Jun","Wang, Yi","Kotha, Surya","Zeng, Wen","Fu, Xiaoyun","Himmelfarb, Jonathan","Zheng, Ying"],"doi":"10.1089\/ten.tea.2016.0213","first_seen_on":"2016-08-29T14:50:10+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1937-335X","1937-3341"],"issue":"19-20","journal":"Tissue Engineering: Part A","last_mentioned_on":1472472000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27481445"],"pmid":"27481445","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["histology","biotechnology"],"title":"Decellularized human kidney cortex hydrogels enhance kidney microvascular endothelial cell maturation and quiescence","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/decellularized-human-kidney-cortex-hydrogels-enhance-kidney-microvascular-endothelial-cell-maturatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.048,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.048},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":1627059,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6667399,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252309,"mean":12.463826783138,"rank":66083,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":73,"this_scored_higher_than":186212,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252309,"percentile":73},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":855,"mean":3.3231756440281,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":751,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":855,"percentile":87},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.1923076923077,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
