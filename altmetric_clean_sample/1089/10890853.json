Lowering SBP has been shown to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality, but the optimal SBP target continues to be a topic of intense debate. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported a significantly lower risk for CVD outcomes and all-cause mortality by targeting SBP <120\u00a0mmHg compared with <140\u00a0mmHg in a population of hypertensive persons at high CV risk. In this review, we discuss the strengths, limitations, and generalizability of SPRINT findings to other hypertensive populations that were excluded from the trial, including those with diabetes or prior stroke, <50\u00a0years old, and at lower CVD risk. We will focus on the implications of SPRINT findings for appropriate BP targets in high-risk groups of hypertensive persons, including the elderly and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We will also address the cost-effectiveness of intensive BP treatment as implemented in SPRINT and the implications of SPRINT for health care policy and future BP guidelines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6143cf058f61000704d","authors":["Bhatt, Hemal","Ghazi, Lama","Calhoun, David","Oparil, Suzanne"],"doi":"10.1007\/s11886-016-0775-0","first_seen_on":"2016-08-29T14:28:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1534-3170","1523-3782"],"issue":"10","journal":"Current Cardiology Reports","last_mentioned_on":1472498212,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27566331"],"pmid":"27566331","pubdate":"2016-08-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medicine & Public Health","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["cardiology"],"title":"BP Targets in Hypertension: What Should We Do Now That SPRINT Is Out?","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/bp-targets-hypertension-we-now-sprint"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8296164,"mean":6.9911317525872,"rank":4110719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":4121783,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8296164,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252309,"mean":12.463680129048,"rank":125723,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":124261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252309,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":340,"mean":4.0352389380531,"rank":135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":204,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":340,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":21.598333333333,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":15}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
