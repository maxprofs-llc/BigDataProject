Type II collagen is the main component of cartilage matrix, which is degraded by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 mediated by MMP-13. Nebivolol, a licensed drug used for the treatment of hypertension in clinics, displays its anti-inflammatory capacity in various conditions. However, whether Nebivolol has a protective effect on cartilage matrix degradation has not been reported before. In this study, we investigated the effects of Nebivolol on regulating the expression of MMP-13 and degradation of type II collagen. Our results indicate that Nebivolol alleviated the increase in gene expression, protein expression, and activity of MMP-13 induced by IL-1\u03b2. Importantly, IL-1\u03b2 strikingly reduced the levels of type II collagen in cell culture supernatants, which was reversed by treatment with Nebivolol in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, Nebivolol was found to alleviate the increased levels of phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 and reduced levels of total I\u03baB\u03b1 induced by IL-1\u03b2, which subsequently mitigated p65 nuclear translocation and the transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, our results indicated that IL-1\u03b2 treatment resulted in a significant increase in expression of the transcriptional factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) at both the mRNA and protein levels, which was significantly ameliorated by treatment with Nebivolol. The combination of these findings suggests that Nebivolol can potentially be applied in human OA treatment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e20","authors":["Zhigang Li","Baoyi Liu","Dewei Zhao","BenJie Wang","Yupeng Liu","Yao Zhang","Fengde Tian","Borui Li"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12192-017-0805-x","first_seen_on":"2017-05-25T15:39:43+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1355-8145","1466-1268"],"journal":"Cell Stress and Chaperones","last_mentioned_on":1495705818,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs12192-017-0805-x"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12192-017-0805-x.pdf","pmid":"28512729","pubdate":"2017-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cancer Research","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Biology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["cellbiology"],"title":"Protective effects of Nebivolol against interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-induced type II collagen destruction mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13)","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":1,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8266357,"mean":6.977935429341,"rank":4395601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2301282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8266357,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237867,"mean":12.1229202324,"rank":130800,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":84772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237867,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237,"mean":2.6593559322034,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":106,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237,"percentile":44},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":5.8947368421053,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/AmandaYogart\/statuses\/867658115059265537","license":"gnip","rt":["ExtracellMatrix"],"citation_ids":[20481101],"posted_on":"2017-05-25T08:26:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Amanda Baker","url":"http:\/\/www.yogart.co.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/423454251264651264\/3l0f46Bd_normal.jpeg","description":"PR and marketing consultant, Pilates and yoga teacher specialising in movement for life for all ages and abilities","id_on_source":"AmandaYogart","tweeter_id":"2274433656","geo":{"lt":50.83413,"ln":-0.27431,"country":"GB"},"followers":806},"tweet_id":"867658115059265537"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/JHElisseeff\/statuses\/867679206909595649","license":"gnip","rt":["ExtracellMatrix"],"citation_ids":[20481101],"posted_on":"2017-05-25T09:50:18+00:00","author":{"name":"JHElisseeff","url":"http:\/\/jlab.johnshopkins.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/573652442929192960\/D1HJUTM7_normal.jpeg","description":"Professor Johns Hopkins Inventor Founding Director Translational Tissue Engineering Center Biomedical Engineering Global Engineering Innovation YGL","id_on_source":"JHElisseeff","tweeter_id":"3073873055","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":626},"tweet_id":"867679206909595649"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ExtracellMatrix\/statuses\/867630077370085376","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[20481101],"posted_on":"2017-05-25T06:35:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Extracellular Matrix","url":"http:\/\/www.extracellularmatrixnews.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/748300476379103233\/3iKR_EC3_normal.jpg","description":"The online resource for the extracellular matrix community.
