The present analysis was done in follow-up to a previous clinical study done by this same group. Nasopharyngeal washes (NPWs) were obtained from 83 of 120 individuals at variable times post adenotonsillectomy, in the absence of ARI symptoms. A look back at virus detection results in NPWs from the same 83 individuals at the time of tonsillectomy revealed that 73.5% (61\/83) were positive for one or more viruses. The overall frequency of respiratory virus detection in post-tonsillectomy NPWs was 58.8%. Rhinovirus (RV) was the agent most frequently detected, in 38 of 83 subjects (45.8%), followed by enterovirus in 7 (8.4%), human metapneumovirus in 6 (7.2%), human respiratory syncytial virus in 3 (3.6%) and human coronavirus in 1 (1.2%). Remarkably, there was no detection of adenovirus (HAdV) or human bocavirus (HBoV) in asymptomatic individuals in follow-up of adenotonsillectomy. In keeping with persistence of respiratory DNA viruses in human tonsils, tonsillectomy significantly reduces asymptomatic shedding of HAdV and HBoV in NPWs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Ronaldo Bragan\u00e7a Martins","Lucas Penna Rocha","Mirela Moreira Prates","Talita Bianca Gagliardi","Balduino Biasoli","Marcelo Junqueira Leite","Guilherme Buzatto","Miguel Angelo Hyppolito","Davi Casale Aragon","Edwin Tamashiro","Fabiana Cardoso Pereira Valera","Eurico Arruda","Wilma Terezinha Anselmo-Lima"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0174188","first_seen_on":"2017-03-17T17:30:11+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"3","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1490037099,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0174188&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174188","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0174188"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0174188&type=printable","pmid":"28306724","pubdate":"2017-03-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e0174188","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Respiratory DNA viruses are undetectable in nasopharyngeal secretions from adenotonsillectomized children","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0174188","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/respiratory-dna-viruses-undetectable-nasopharyngeal-secretions-adenotonsillectomized-children"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10.72,"score_history":{"1y":10.72,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10.72},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8389481,"mean":7.0670107241375,"rank":811061,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":90,"this_scored_higher_than":7578426,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8389481,"percentile":90},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":266323,"mean":13.115714278204,"rank":41482,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":224840,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":266323,"percentile":84},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":115757,"mean":10.634830246381,"rank":16973,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":98782,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":115757,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4524,"mean":11.096378067654,"rank":686,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":3838,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4524,"percentile":84}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
