The present work proves that L1-norm PCA can perform independent component analysis (ICA) under the whitening assumption. However, when the source probability distributions fulfil certain conditions, the L1-norm criterion needs to be minimized rather than maximized, which can be accomplished by simple modifications on existing optimal algorithms for L1- PCA. If the sources have symmetric distributions, we show in addition that L1-PCA is linked to kurtosis optimization. A number of numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and analyze the comparative performance of different algorithms for ICA via L1-PCA. Although our analysis is asymptotic in the sample size, this equivalence opens interesting new perspectives for performing ICA using optimal algorithms for L1-PCA with guaranteed global convergence while inheriting the increased robustness to outliers of the L1-norm criterion.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002a67","authors":["R.
