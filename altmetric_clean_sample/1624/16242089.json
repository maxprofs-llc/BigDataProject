In the transduced cells infected with HIV-1, the nascent Fab fragments bind intracellularly to the HIV-1 envelope protein and inhibit HIV-1 production. The secreted Fab fragments are able to neutralize cell-free HIV-1. In addition, the nascent Fab fragments can inhibit HIV-1 production by binding intracellularly to envelope mutants that escape neutralization by extracellular F105 antibody. The combined intra- and extracellular binding activities of the expressed Fab fragments result in the efficient blocking of cytopathic syncytium formation and infectious virus production. Thus, these antibody-producing T lymphocytes are not only resistant to HIV-1 infection but also can protect surrounding lymphocytes by secreting neutralizing antibodies. This novel strategy of combining intracellular and extracellular immunization may be useful for gene therapy of AIDS and other diseases.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["S Y Chen","Y Khouri","J Bagley","W A Marasco"],"first_seen_on":"2017-02-08T23:44:09+00:00","issns":["0027-8424"],"issue":"13","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","last_mentioned_on":1486580640,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC44111"],"pdf_url":"\/pmc\/articles\/PMC44111\/pdf\/pnas01135-0207.pdf","pmcid":"PMC44111","pmid":"8016092","pubdate":"1994-06-21T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"5932","subjects":["science"],"title":"Combined intra- and extracellular immunization against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection with a human anti-gp120 antibody.","type":"article","volume":"91","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/combined-intraand-extracellular-immunization-against-human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1-infection-h-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8177609,"mean":6.9186386481167,"rank":1602744,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6540010,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8177609,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264237,"mean":12.843516197641,"rank":73343,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":190499,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264237,"percentile":72},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":46215,"mean":23.942890033323,"rank":18815,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":27119,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":46215,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1010,"mean":55.084806739346,"rank":575,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":434,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1010,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
