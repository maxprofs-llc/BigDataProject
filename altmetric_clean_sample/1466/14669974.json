Our theoretical and experimental results reveal that these Se-vacancies can efficiently activate and optimize the basal planes of the WSe2 MLNSs. As expected, the optimized catalyst exhibits efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100024e2","authors":["Ying Sun","Xuewei Zhang","Baoguang Mao","Minhua Cao"],"doi":"10.1039\/c6cc07832j","endpage":"14269","first_seen_on":"2016-12-12T10:01:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1364-548X"],"issue":"99","journal":"Chemical Communications","last_mentioned_on":1481556885,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2016\/cc\/c6cc07832j#!divAbstract?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2016\/cc\/c6cc07832j","pmid":"27878150","pubdate":"2016-12-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Materials Science","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"14266","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"\n              Controllable selenium vacancy engineering in basal planes of mechanically exfoliated WSe\n              2\n              monolayer nanosheets for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution\n            ","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/controllable-selenium-vacancy-engineering-basal-planes-mechanically-exfoliated-wse-sub2sub-monolayer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.35,"score_history":{"1y":2.35,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7879571,"mean":6.6725285125901,"rank":3208729,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4628144,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7879571,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251182,"mean":12.322498254247,"rank":98180,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":150831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251182,"percentile":60},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5648,"mean":3.0145578183106,"rank":1748,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":3846,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5648,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":213,"mean":4.0242641509434,"rank":75,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":131,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":213,"percentile":61}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
