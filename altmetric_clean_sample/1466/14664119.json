The latest research on weight control was presented by young up-and-coming investigators. The symposium consisted of the following presentations: Gastrointestinal brush cells, immunity, and energy homeostasis; Impact of a brown rice-derived bioactive product on feeding regulation and fuel metabolism; A novel G protein-coupled receptor-regulated neuronal signaling pathway triggers sustained orexigenic effects; and NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine regulates food preference. These four talks presented at the symposium were summarized as a series of short reviews in this review.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df2","authors":["Yoshiro Ishimaru","Chisayo Kozuka","Kenichiro Nakajima","Tsutomu Sasaki"],"doi":"10.1007\/s12576-016-0495-7","endpage":"95","first_seen_on":"2016-12-12T03:45:23+00:00","issns":["1880-6562","1880-6546"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of Physiological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1494410825,"links":["http:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s12576-016-0495-7","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27730500?dopt=Abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs12576-016-0495-7.pdf","pmid":"27730500","pubdate":"2016-10-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Biochemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Animal Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Cell Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Human Physiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurobiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Physiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"83","subjects":["physiology"],"title":"Expanding frontiers in weight-control research explored by young investigators","type":"article","volume":"67","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expanding-frontiers-weightcontrol-research-explored-young-investigators"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0.5,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8183022,"mean":6.92160443679,"rank":4337520,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2272348,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8183022,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":267380,"mean":12.230010030705,"rank":148121,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":93161,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":267380,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":162,"mean":3.0795776397516,"rank":66,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":77,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":162,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":3.025,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
