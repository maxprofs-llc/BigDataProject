We measured vestibular sensory evoked potentials (VsEPs) in \u03b19 knockout mice, \u03b110 knockout mice, \u03b17 knockout mice, \u03b19\/10 and \u03b17\/9 double knockouts, and wild type controls. We also studied the morphology and ultrastructure of efferent terminals on vestibular hair cells in \u03b19, \u03b110 and \u03b19\/10 knockouts. Both type I and type ll vestibular hair cells express the \u03b19 and \u03b110 subunits. The efferent boutons on vestibular cells in \u03b19, \u03b110 and \u03b19\/10 knockouts appeared normal, but a quantitative analysis was not performed. Mean VsEP thresholds were significantly elevated in \u03b19 and \u03b19\/10 knockout animals. Some \u03b19 and \u03b19\/10 knockout animals, however, had normal or near normal thresholds, while others were greatly affected. Despite individual variability in threshold responses, latencies were consistently shortened. The double \u03b17\/9 KO resulted in decreased variance by normalizing waveforms and latencies. The phenotypes of the \u03b17 and \u03b110 single KOs were identical. Both \u03b17 and \u03b110 knockout mice evidenced normal thresholds, decreased activation latencies and had larger amplitudes compared to WT mice. The data suggest a complex interaction of nAChR receptors in regulating vestibular afferent gain and activation timing. Although the \u03b19\/10 heteromeric nAChR is an important component of vestibular efferent activity, other peripheral or central nAChRs involving the \u03b17 subunit or \u03b110 subunit and \u03b19 homomeric receptors are also important.
