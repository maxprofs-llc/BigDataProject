This meta-analysis aims to synthesize relevant studies to evaluate the association between serum vitamin E and the risk of CRC based on case-control studies.\nPotentially relevant studies were selected by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The association between serum vitamin E levels and CRC was estimated by the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Q test and I statistic. Subgroup analysis was conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was performed to reveal stability and reliability.\nA total of 10 papers with 11 studies, including 6431 subjects with 520 CRC patients and 5981 controls, were included in this present meta-analysis. The results indicated that compared with healthy controls, patients with CRC showed lower concentrations of serum vitamin E (WMD\u200a=\u200a-2.994\u200a\u03bcmol\/L, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a-4.395 to -1.593). Ethnicity subgroup analysis indicated that the serum vitamin E levels were lower in European (WMD\u200a=\u200a-1.82\u200a\u03bcmol\/L, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a-3.00 to -0.65), but not in Asian. Control-source subgroup analysis revealed that a significant association was observed in subgroup with hospital-based controls (WMD\u200a=\u200a-3.43\u200a\u03bcmol\/L, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a-6.27 to -0.59), but not in those with population-based controls. Sensitivity analysis suggested no significant difference in the pooled estimates, indicating stable results.\nCRC is associated with a lower concentration of serum vitamin E. However, necessary prospective cohort studies should be conducted to assess the effect of serum vitamin E on the risk of CRC in the future.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b27","authors":["Yonghai Dong","Yun Liu","Yan Shu","Xiaodan Chen","Jilong Hu","Ruizhi Zheng","Dongyang Ma","Cheng Yang","Xihong Guan"],"doi":"10.1097\/md.0000000000007470","first_seen_on":"2017-08-30T01:40:29+00:00","issns":["0025-7974"],"issue":"27","journal":"Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506257813,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/MD.0000000000007470","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5502190\/"],"pdf_url":"insights.ovid.com\/Common\/SSRPdf\/V1\/JOURNAL%2fmedi%2fbeta%2f00005792-201707070-00059%2froot%2fv%2f2017-07-06T095525Z%2fr%2fapplication-pdf","pmid":"00005792-201707070-00059","pubdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Medicine","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Link between risk of colorectal cancer and serum vitamin E levels","type":"article","volume":"29"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.58,"score_history":{"1y":7.58,"6m":7.58,"3m":7.58,"1m":0.5,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.58},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8457084,"mean":7.1060307514935,"rank":1183272,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":7268831,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8457084,"percentile":85},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176813,"mean":12.511082618827,"rank":33325,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":143269,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176813,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4292,"mean":2.9428869727336,"rank":259,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4032,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4292,"percentile":93},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":159,"mean":1.771582278481,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":150,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":159,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"BR":1}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Vitamin E deficiency may lead to increased colorectal cancer risk: Chinese meta-analysis","url":"http:\/\/www.nutraingredients.com\/Research\/Vitamin-E-deficiency-may-lead-to-increased-colorectal-cancer-risk-Chinese-meta-analysis?utm_source=RSS_text_news&amp;utm_medium=RSS_feed&amp;utm_campaign=RSS_Text_News","license":"public","citation_ids":[24502851],"posted_on":"2017-08-28T11:56:00+00:00","summary":"Vitamin E deficiency might be linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer, according to a Chinese systematic review and meta-analysis.","author":{"name":"NutraIngredients RSS","url":"http:\/\/www.nutraingredients.com\/","description":"Breaking News on Supplements &amp; Nutrition - Europe"}}],"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cbraghini\/statuses\/911937482421407744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24502851],"posted_on":"2017-09-24T12:56:53+00:00","author":{"name":"Carlos Braghini Jr.","url":"http:\/\/www.ecologiacelular.com.br","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/880784028705714177\/OhLb8Rnw_normal.jpg","description":"M\u00e9dico, trabalha com Controle da Dor, Reeduca\u00e7\u00e3o Alimentar e Reequil\u00edbrio Metab\u00f3lico.
