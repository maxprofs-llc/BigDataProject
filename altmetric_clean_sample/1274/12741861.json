From late 2003, the National Blood Service provided 80 to 90 percent of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and plasma for platelet (PLT) pools from male donors.\nForty-nine percent of reports were highly likely\/probable TRALI, and 51 percent possible\/unlikely. Of 96 investigations, donor antibodies recognizing recipient antigens were found in 73 cases (65%), with HLA Class I in 25 of those (40%), HLA Class II antibodies in 38 (62%), and granulocyte antibodies in 12 (17%). A review in 2003 revealed that the TRALI risk\/component was 6.9 times higher for FFP and 8.2 times higher for PLTs than for red blood cells, and that in donors of implicated FFP\/PLTs, white blood cell antibodies were found 3.6 times more often than by chance (p <or= 0.0001), with all implicated donors being female. Provision of male plasma was associated with a reduction in TRALI reports from 36 in 2003 to 23 in each of 2004 and 2005 and 10 in 2006. Highly likely\/probable cases reduced from 22 in 2003 to 13, 6, and 3 [corrected] in the 3 subsequent years, with cases implicating FFP or PLTs with positive donor serology [corrected] falling from 16 to 9, 3, and 1 respectively.\nThe risk of highly likely\/probable TRALI due to FFP has fallen from 15.5 per million units issued during 1999 through 2004 to 3.2 per million during 2005 through 2006 (p = 0.0079) and from 14.0 per million to 5.8 per million for PLTs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f61000368b","authors":["Chapman, Catherine E","Stainsby, Dorothy","Jones, Hilary","Love, Elizabeth","Massey, Edwin","Win, Nay","Navarrete, Cristina","Lucas, Geoff","Soni, Neil","Morgan, Cliff","Choo, Louise","Cohen, Hannah","Williamson, Lorna M",", ","Chapman, Catherine E.","Williamson, Lorna M."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2008.01948.x","endpage":"452","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T22:07:13+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1537-2995","00411132","15372995"],"issue":"3","journal":"Transfusion","last_mentioned_on":1325376000,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18980623","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2008.01948.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2008.01948.x\/pdf","pmid":"18980623","pubdate":"2009-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Inc","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"440","subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Ten years of hemovigilance reports of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the United Kingdom and the impact of preferential use of male donor plasma","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1111\/j.1537-2995.2008.01948.x","volume":"49","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/ten-years-hemovigilance-reports-transfusionrelated-acute-lung-injury-united-kingdom-impact-preferent"},"altmetric_score":{"score":6,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8438691,"mean":7.0965835121246,"rank":1407314,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":6953565,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8438691,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":250054,"mean":12.773562700707,"rank":61390,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":188428,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":250054,"percentile":75},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1713,"mean":4.4144719626168,"rank":182,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":1460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1713,"percentile":85},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":44,"mean":12.925534883721,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":77,"this_scored_higher_than":34,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":44,"percentile":77}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Ph.
