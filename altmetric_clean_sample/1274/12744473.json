The objective of this report is to provide the latest evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of vulvovaginitis in prepubertal and adolescent females. In this systematic review we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence system. Vulvovaginal complaints are common in the pediatric and adolescent age group. The patient's age in conjunction with history and associated complaints will guide evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Treatment should include counseling on hygiene and voiding techniques as well as therapy for any specific pathogens identified.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eac","authors":["Andrea Zuckerman","Mary Romano"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.jpag.2016.08.002","first_seen_on":"2016-10-18T23:06:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["10833188","1873-4332"],"issue":"6","journal":"Journal of Pediatric & Adolescent Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1474524121,"links":["http:\/\/www.jpagonline.org\/article\/S1083-3188(16)30132-2\/fulltext"],"pmid":"27969009","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pediatrics","gynecology"],"title":"Clinical Recommendation: Vulvovaginitis","type":"article","volume":"29","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-recommendation-vulvovaginitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":6388671,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1143066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249787,"mean":12.774920219708,"rank":174331,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":45430,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249787,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":519,"mean":3.1338108108108,"rank":378,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":93,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":519,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":24,"mean":2.1326086956522,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":24,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
