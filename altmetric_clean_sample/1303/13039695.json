Cereals are particularly inefficient at soil N uptake, where the unrecovered nitrogen causes serious environmental damage. Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) is an important cereal crop, particularly in resource-poor semi-arid regions, and is known to have a high NUE in comparison to other major cereals under limited N conditions. This study provides the first assessment of genetic diversity and signatures of selection across 230 fully sequenced genes putatively involved in the uptake and utilization of N from a diverse panel of sorghum lines. This comprehensive analysis reveals an overall reduction in diversity as a result of domestication and a total of 128 genes displaying signatures of purifying selection, thereby revealing possible gene targets to improve NUE in sorghum and cereals alike. A number of key genes appear to have been involved in selective sweeps, reducing their sequence diversity. The ammonium transporter (AMT) genes generally had low allelic diversity, whereas a substantial number of nitrate\/peptide transporter 1 (NRT1\/PTR) genes had higher nucleotide diversity in domesticated germplasm. Interestingly, members of the distinct race Guinea margaritiferum contained a number of unique alleles, and along with the wild sorghum species, represent a rich resource of new variation for plant improvement of NUE in sorghum.","altmetric_jid":"52f8bc933cf058d4628b456f","authors":["Massel, Karen","Campbell, Bradley C.","Mace, Emma S.","Tai, Shuaishuai","Tao, Yongfu","Worland, Belinda G.","Jordan, David R.","Botella, Jose R.","Godwin, Ian D.","Campbell, Bradley C","Mace, Emma S","Worland, Belinda G","Jordan, David R","Botella, Jose R","Godwin, Ian D"],"doi":"10.3389\/fpls.2016.01544","first_seen_on":"2016-10-25T22:48:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1664-462X"],"journal":"Frontiers in Plant Science","last_mentioned_on":1479257070,"links":["http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01544\/full?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01544\/full","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27826302"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journal.frontiersin.org\/article\/10.3389\/fpls.2016.01544\/pdf","pmid":"27826302","pubdate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Whole Genome Sequencing Reveals Potential New Targets for Improving Nitrogen Uptake and Utilization in Sorghum bicolor","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/whole-genome-sequencing-reveals-potential-new-targets-improving-nitrogen-uptake-utilization-sorghum"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7.5,"score_history":{"1y":7.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7700406,"mean":6.6097173252523,"rank":1019525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":6675353,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7700406,"percentile":86},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":237585,"mean":12.69544926426,"rank":48550,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":188847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":237585,"percentile":79},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5074,"mean":2.4597646363099,"rank":277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":4795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5074,"percentile":94},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":398,"mean":2.7343828715365,"rank":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":375,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":398,"percentile":94}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":8,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":8}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
