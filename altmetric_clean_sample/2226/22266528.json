Here, the aims were to characterize the oral microbiota by deep sequencing in a low-caries population with regular dental care since childhood and search for association with caries prevalence and incidence. Saliva and tooth biofilm from 17-year-olds and mock bacteria communities were analysed using 16S rDNA Illumina MiSeq (v3-v4) and PacBio SMRT (v1-v8) sequencing including validity and reliability estimates. Caries was scored at 17 and 19 years of age. Both sequencing platforms revealed that Firmicutes dominated in the saliva, whereas Firmicutes and Actinobacteria abundances were similar in tooth biofilm. Saliva microbiota discriminated caries-affected from caries-free adolescents, with enumeration of Scardovia wiggsiae, Streptococcus mutans, Bifidobacterium longum, Leptotrichia sp. HOT498, and Selenomonas spp. in caries-affected participants. Adolescents with B. longum in saliva had significantly higher 2-year caries increment. PacBio SMRT revealed Corynebacterium matruchotii as the most prevalent species in tooth biofilm. In conclusion, both sequencing methods were reliable and valid for oral samples, and saliva microbiota was associated with cross-sectional caries prevalence, especially S. wiggsiae, S. mutans, and B. longum; the latter also with the 2-year caries incidence.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Eriksson, Linda","Lif Holgerson, Pernilla","Johansson, Ingegerd","Linda Eriksson","Pernilla Lif Holgerson","Ingegerd Johansson"],"doi":"10.1038\/s41598-017-06221-z","first_seen_on":"2017-07-22T00:58:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["2045-2322"],"issue":"1","journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1500798292,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28724921?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-06221-z","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28724921?dopt=Abstractu0026utm_source=dlvr.itu0026utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41598-017-06221-z.pdf","pmid":"28724921","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","startpage":"5861","subjects":["science"],"title":"Saliva and tooth biofilm bacterial microbiota in adolescents in a low caries community","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/saliva-tooth-biofilm-bacterial-microbiota-adolescents-low-caries-community"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.6,"score_history":{"1y":1.6,"6m":1.6,"3m":1.6,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.6},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8261086,"mean":6.9752528681095,"rank":3872277,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":4355760,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8261086,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":170714,"mean":11.627681723126,"rank":75969,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":93419,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":170714,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":35409,"mean":14.782470854044,"rank":17100,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":18069,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":35409,"percentile":51},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3277,"mean":12.320352869353,"rank":1467,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":1772,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3277,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":2,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
