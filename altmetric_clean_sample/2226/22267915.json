Dementia was defined by (1) hospitalization diagnosis codes (1996-2012) and (2) a comprehensive neurocognitive examination (2011-2013) with adjudication.\nOSA and sleep duration were not associated with risk of incident dementia. When using adjudicated outcomes, severe OSA (\u226530 vs. <5 apnea-hypopnea events\/hour) was associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia (risk ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.35 [1.06-5.18]) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (1.66 [1.03-2.68]); associations were attenuated with cardiovascular risk factor adjustment. Sleeping <7 versus 8 to \u22649\u00a0hours was associated with higher risk of all-cause dementia (2.00 [1.03-3.86]).\nWhen adjudicated outcome definitions were used, late-midlife OSA and short sleep duration were associated with all-cause and Alzheimer's disease dementia in later life.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6083cf058f61000695c","authors":["Lutsey, Pamela L.","Misialek, Jeffrey R.","Mosley, Thomas H.","Gottesman, Rebecca F.","Punjabi, Naresh M.","Shahar, Eyal","MacLehose, Richard","Ogilvie, Rachel P.","Knopman, David","Alonso, Alvaro","Pamela L.
