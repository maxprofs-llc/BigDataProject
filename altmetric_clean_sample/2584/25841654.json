Dendritic cells (DCs), the most effective antigen-presenting cells, are widely distributed beneath respiratory epithelium, DCs uptake and present antigens to T cells, to initiate protective immune responses in different infections. In this study, we investigated the role of porcine DCs in vaccine Mhp-168 exposure.\nThe antigen presenting ability of DCs were improved by vaccine Mhp-168 exposure. DCs could activate T-cell proliferation by up-regulating the antigen presenting molecule MHCII expression and co-stimulatory molecule CD80\/86. However, the up-regulation of IL-10 and accompany with down-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 gene level may account for the limitation of attenuated Mhp-168 strain use as vaccine alone.\nThese findings are benefit for exploring the protection mechanisms and the possible limitations of this attenuated Mhp-168 vaccine.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4cc3cf058f6100004b5","authors":["Yumeng Shen","Weiwei Hu","Yanna Wei","Zhixin Feng","Qian Yang"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12917-017-1194-1","first_seen_on":"2017-09-17T22:10:18+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1746-6148"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Veterinary Research","last_mentioned_on":1505739642,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28915878?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","https:\/\/bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com\/articles\/10.1186\/s12917-017-1194-1?platform=hootsuite"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s12917-017-1194-1?site=bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"28915878","pubdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Veterinary"],"startpage":"285","title":"The immune mechanism of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae 168 vaccine strain through dendritic cells","type":"article","volume":"13"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8430317,"mean":7.0913096536278,"rank":4256324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3956790,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8430317,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112932,"mean":11.937551938795,"rank":54765,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":52860,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112932,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1288,"mean":2.7333395493396,"rank":521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":706,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1288,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":31,"mean":2.1553333333333,"rank":12,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":17,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":31,"percentile":54}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DCell_papers\/statuses\/909539983324618752","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25841654],"posted_on":"2017-09-17T22:10:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Dendritic cells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444106482712182784\/jm3fnA5u_normal.jpeg","description":"Journal paper feed for academics interested in dendritic cells, immunology and immunity (image source: NIH)","id_on_source":"DCell_papers","tweeter_id":"2386845055","geo":{"lt":53.48095,"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB"},"followers":247},"tweet_id":"909539983324618752"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ProfVeterinario\/statuses\/909764117031944192","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[25841654],"posted_on":"2017-09-18T13:00:42+00:00","author":{"name":"MissioneVeterinario","url":"http:\/\/www.missioneveterinario.it","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/536892153977245698\/9Om4Hwxy_normal.png","description":"#AggiornamentoProfessionale per #Veterinari.\nCorso #ECM #MissioneVeterinario accreditato dal #MinisteroDellaSalute 36 crediti in modalit\u00e0 #FAD.","id_on_source":"ProfVeterinario","tweeter_id":"2412518042","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":619},"tweet_id":"909764117031944192"}]}}
