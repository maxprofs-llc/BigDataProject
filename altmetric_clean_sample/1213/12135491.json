Stapled peptides are therapeutic protein mimetics that have been locked within a specific conformational structure by hydrocarbon stapling. These peptides are highly important in selectively impairing disease-relevant protein-protein interactions and exhibit significant pharmacokinetic advantages over other forms of therapeutics in terms of affinity, specificity, size, synthetic accessibility and resistance to proteolytic degradation. A series of stapled peptides are currently in development, and the potential successes of these peptides, either as single-agent treatments or as combinational treatments with other therapeutic modalities, could potentially change the landscape of protein therapeutic development. Here, we provide examples of successful discovery efforts to illustrate the research strategies of stapled peptides in drug design and development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074e0","authors":["Xiayang Xie"],"doi":"10.4155\/fmc-2016-0102","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T11:53:16+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1756-8919","1756-8927"],"journal":"Future Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474545182,"links":["http:\/\/www.future-science.com\/doi\/full\/10.4155\/fmc-2016-0102"],"pmid":"27654699","pubdate":"2016-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["chemistry","pharmacy"],"title":"Stapled peptides: providing the best of both worlds in drug development","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/stapled-peptides-providing-best-both-worlds-drug-development"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4496317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2344089,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253723,"mean":12.66697665161,"rank":140077,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89378,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253723,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":524,"mean":3.5013499043977,"rank":216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":524,"percentile":47},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":32,"mean":2.9009677419355,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":6,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":32,"percentile":6}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.
