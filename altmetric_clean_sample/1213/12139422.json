In details, 1,3-thiazolidin-4-ones bearing (cyclo)aliphatic or (hetero)aromatic moieties linked to the N1-hydrazine at C2 were synthesized and classified into three series according to the aromatic or bicyclic rings connected to the lactam nitrogen of the thiazolidinone. These molecules were assayed for their anti-Candida effects in reference to the biological activity of the conventional topic (clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole) and systemic drugs (fluconazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin B). Finally, we investigated the selectivity against fungal cells by testing the compounds endowed with the best MICs on Hep2 cells in order to assess their cell toxicity (CC50) and we noticed that two derivatives were less cytotoxic than the reference drug clotrimazole. Moreover, a preliminary molecular modelling approach has been performed against lanosterol 14-\u03b1 demethylase (CYP51A1) to rationalize the activity of the tested compounds and to specify the target protein or enzyme.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["De Monte, Celeste","Carradori, Simone","Bizzarri, Bruna","Bolasco, Adriana","Caprara, Federica","Mollica, Adriano","Rivanera, Daniela","Mari, Emanuela","Zicari, Alessandra","Akdemir, Atilla","Secci, Daniela"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ejmech.2015.10.048","endpage":"96","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T15:50:27+00:00","issns":["1768-3254","02235234"],"journal":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1474559415,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26562544?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26562544","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"82","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Anti-Candida activity and cytotoxicity of a large library of new N-substituted-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives","type":"article","volume":"107","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/anticandida-activity-cytotoxicity-large-library-new-nsubstituted13thiazolidin4one-derivatives"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253724,"mean":12.666811049845,"rank":209386,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253724,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1167,"mean":1.8415162950257,"rank":749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1167,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117,"mean":2.1193965517241,"rank":71,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
