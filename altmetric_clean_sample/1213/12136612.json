Cases were divided into two groups based on whether their first-trimester PAPP-A multiple of the median (MoM) levels were \u22640.5 (Group 1, n=75) or >0.5 (Group 2, n=208). As primary end points, the rate of cesarean section (C\/S), the rate of C\/S due to fetal distress, and the umbilical artery blood pH values in cases of C\/S for fetal distress were compared between the two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using the Chi-square test and independent samples t-test. P\u22640.05 were considered statistically significant.\nThe mean gestational age at birth and the birth weights were significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p=0.002 and p=0.007, respectively). Although the rate of C\/S was similar between the groups (p=0.823), the rate of C\/S due to fetal distress was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (68.4% vs. 42%, respectively; p=0.050) and the mean umbilical artery blood pH value for C\/S deliveries indicated by fetal distress was lower (p=0.048) in Group 1 than in Group 2. When the mode of delivery was analyzed according to the application of labor induction, both the C\/S delivery rates (31.6% in Group 1 and 31.7% in Group 2; p=0.992) and C\/S delivery rates due to fetal distress (66.7% in Group 1 and 46.2% in Group 2; p=0.405) were similar in both groups.\nLow PAPP-A levels (\u22640.5 MoM) in the first trimester are associated with the risk of intrapartum fetal distress development and the likelihood of C\/S for fetal distress. Nonetheless, this risk is not affected by labor induction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa52d3cf058f610004116","authors":["Av\u015far, Ay\u015fe Filiz","Se\u00e7en, El\u00e7in \u0130\u015flek","Ak\u00e7ay, G\u00fclin Feykan Ye\u011fin","Keskin, H\u00fcseyin Levent","Ta\u015f, Emre Erdem","Dalgac\u0131, Ahmet Ferit"],"doi":"10.5152\/jtgga.2016.16022","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T12:27:08+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1309-0399"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of the Turkish-German Gynecological Association","last_mentioned_on":1474547047,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27651721?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27651721","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The relationship between first-trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A levels and intrapartum fetal distress development.","type":"article","volume":"17"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":7275660,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253724,"mean":12.666912735542,"rank":209391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253724,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":52,"mean":2.1,"rank":32,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":52,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":17,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BlameOxytocin\/statuses\/778932891673702404","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12136612],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T12:24:07+00:00","author":{"name":"The Love Hormone","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/647614031289708544\/4CuoFMsx_normal.png","description":"RSS feed of oxytocin and vasopressin papers in PubMed.
