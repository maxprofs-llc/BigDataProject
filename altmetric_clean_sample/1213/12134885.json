Although suitable tools for selective Treg cell manipulation in man are missing, their number and function can be altered by a number of drugs and biologicals and by reprogramming tumor-infiltrating antigen presenting cells. Nanoparticles offer exceptional new options in drug and gene delivery by prolonging the circulation time of their cargo, protecting it from degradation and promoting its local accumulation in cells and tissues. In tumor therapy, the use of nanoparticles is expected to overcome limitations in drug delivery and provide novel means for cell-specific functional alteration. In this perspective, we summarize strategies suitable for interference with Treg-mediated suppression, discuss the potential use of nanoparticles for this purpose and identify additional, unexplored opportunities.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823a","authors":["Helmut Jonuleit"],"doi":"10.2217\/nnm-2016-0197","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T11:04:17+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1743-5889","1748-6963"],"journal":"Nanomedicine","last_mentioned_on":1474547343,"links":["http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/abs\/10.2217\/nnm-2016-0197","http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/doi\/full\/10.2217\/nnm-2016-0197"],"pmid":"27654070","pubdate":"2016-09-21T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Treg cells as potential cellular targets for functionalized nanoparticles in cancer therapy","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/treg-cells-potential-cellular-targets-functionalized-nanoparticles-cancer-therapy-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":3660585,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":4637462,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":55},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253723,"mean":12.666952806615,"rank":105861,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":56,"this_scored_higher_than":143604,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253723,"percentile":56},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.923390438247,"rank":126,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":365,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":72},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":2.0348275862069,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":20,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2,"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":3,"Veterinary Science and Veterinary Medicine":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1},"mendeley":{"AT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fsghep\/statuses\/778912743541702658","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12134885],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T11:04:04+00:00","author":{"name":"Hepatic Oncology Jnl","url":"http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/loi\/hep","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/489037783885815809\/N8dpxCuY_normal.jpeg","description":"Hepatic Oncology Journal | Focus on the management of adult and pediatric #livercancer #HCC | Published by Future Science Group","id_on_source":"fsghep","tweeter_id":"2647648802","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1205},"tweet_id":"778912743541702658"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/fsgijh\/statuses\/778912755520671744","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12134885],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T11:04:07+00:00","author":{"name":"Int J Hematol Oncol","url":"http:\/\/www.futuremedicine.com\/loi\/ijh","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/491506510065713152\/Sj2mCmUv_normal.jpeg","description":"International Journal of Hematologic Oncology | Advancements in diagnosis, treatment strategies and novel targeted therapies | Published by Future Science Group","id_on_source":"fsgijh","tweeter_id":"2668858369","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":904},"tweet_id":"778912755520671744"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/RosalindFSG\/statuses\/778934132470493185","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12134885],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T12:29:03+00:00","author":{"name":"Rosalind Hill","url":"http:\/\/www.future-science-group.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/555020368553836544\/0BCPcJeX_normal.jpeg","description":"Digital Publishing Director @futuresciencegp.
