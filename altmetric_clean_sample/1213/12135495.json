The assemblies have been comprehensively characterized by a series of analytical techniques ((1)H NMR titration experiments, 2D COSY and HETCOR NMR spectra and low temperature (1)H NMR spectroscopy) and the crystal structures have been elucidated by X-ray diffraction. The optoelectronic properties of the assemblies and the electronic interaction between the iridium and porphyrin chromophoric units have been explored with detailed photophysical measurements, supported by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026c9","authors":["Diego Rota Martir","Gordon J Hedley","David Bradford Cordes","Alexandra Slawin","Daniel Escudero","Denis Jacquemin","Tamara Kosikova","Douglas Philp","Daniel Dawson","Sharon Elizabeth Ashbrook","Ifor Samuel","Eli Zysman-Colman","Gordon J.
