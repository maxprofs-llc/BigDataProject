With better understanding of the physiology of the open chest and refinements in thoracic anesthetic and surgical approaches, Filipino surgeons began performing thoracoplasties, then lung resections for pulmonary tuberculosis and later for lung cancer in specialty hospitals dealing with pulmonary diseases-first at the Quezon Institute (QI) and presently at the Lung Center of the Philippines although some university and private hospitals made occasional forays into the chest. Esophageal surgery began its early attempts during the post-World War II era at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), a university hospital affiliated with the University of the Philippines. With the introduction of minimally invasive thoracic surgical approaches, Filipino thoracic surgeons have managed to keep up with their Asian counterparts although the problems of financial reimbursement typical of a developing country remain. The need for creative innovative approaches of a focused multidisciplinary team will advance the boundaries of thoracic surgery in the Philippines.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa67d3cf058f61000981b","authors":["Danguilan, Jose Luis J"],"doi":"10.21037\/jtd.2016.06.56","endpage":"S617","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T14:11:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2072-1439","20721439","20776624"],"issue":"Suppl 8","journal":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","last_mentioned_on":1474553505,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27651936Clinical"],"pmid":"27651936","pubdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"S613","title":"Clinical innovations in Philippine thoracic surgery","type":"article","volume":"8","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-innovations-philippine-thoracic-surgery"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8418826,"mean":7.0849522326371,"rank":4496304,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2344105,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8418826,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253724,"mean":12.666849083449,"rank":140073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":89388,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253724,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":580,"mean":2.3625319516408,"rank":165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":349,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":580,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":2.3640909090909,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":9,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":39}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/malariapw_paper\/statuses\/778959975678939136","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[12138038],"posted_on":"2016-09-22T14:11:45+00:00","author":{"name":"@malariapw_papers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_4_normal.png","id_on_source":"malariapw_paper","tweeter_id":"778582270789681152","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":1},"tweet_id":"778959975678939136"}]}}
