Yet, it is unknown whether this positive effect is sustained once the incentives stop.\nPatients in the intervention and control group were followed up for 2\u2005years after the intervention. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at 6\u2005months and 24\u2005months post intervention. Assessments were conducted between September 2011 and November 2014.\nAfter the intervention period, intervention and control groups did not show any statistically significant differences in adherence, neither in the first 6\u2005months (71% and 77%, respectively) nor in the following 18\u2005months (68%, 74%). There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes, that is, adherence \u226595% and untoward incidents either.\nIt may be concluded that incentives to improve adherence to antipsychotic maintenance medication are effective only for as long as they are provided. Once they are stopped, adherence returns to approximately baseline level with no sustained benefit.\nISRCTN77769281; Results.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006cc0","authors":["Stefan Priebe","Stephen A Bremner","Hana Pavlickova"],"doi":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011673","first_seen_on":"2016-09-22T07:51:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2044-6055"],"issue":"9","journal":"BMJ Open","last_mentioned_on":1476248400,"links":["http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673?cpetoc","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=gmpxZuWvdjD32uZ","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011673","http:\/\/bmjopenbeta.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673.short?g=w_open_current_tab","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673.abstract","http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673.short?g=w_open_current_tab","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1136\/bmjopen-2016-011673"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/content\/6\/9\/e011673.full.pdf","pmid":"27655261","pubdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","startpage":"e011673","title":"Discontinuing financial incentives for adherence to antipsychotic depot medication: long-term outcomes of a cluster randomised controlled trial","type":"article","volume":"6","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/discontinuing-financial-incentives-adherence-antipsychotic-depot-medication-longterm-outcomes-cluste"},"altmetric_score":{"score":16.75,"score_history":{"1y":16.75,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":16.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7992424,"mean":6.7383403203205,"rank":474656,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":94,"this_scored_higher_than":7516617,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7992424,"percentile":94},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":248572,"mean":12.470604615985,"rank":25843,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":222669,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":248572,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5715,"mean":16.782589079454,"rank":963,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":4748,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5715,"percentile":83},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":418,"mean":28.542316546763,"rank":72,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":346,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":418,"percentile":82}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
