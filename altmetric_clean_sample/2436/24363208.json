Five eyes (29%) belonged to International Classification of Retinoblastoma group C and 12 eyes (71%) belonged to group D. Primary treatment included triple drug intravenous chemotherapy for a mean of 10 cycles (median, 9 cycles; range, 6-18 cycles). Fifteen patients (88%) had undergone 56 periocular carboplatin injections with a mean of 4 injections (median, 3 injections; range, 1-8 injections), concurrent with intravenous chemotherapy. A total of 53 intravitreal topotecan injections were performed in 17 eyes of 17 consecutive patients with refractory or recurrent vitreous seeds with a mean of 3 injections (median, 3 injections; range, 2-6 injections). Complete regression of vitreous seeds was achieved in 17 of 17 eyes (100%). At a mean follow-up of 23.8 months (median, 24 months; range, 15.1-34.1 months), one eye (6%) with a recurrent retinal tumour needed enucleation, and the rest of the 16 eyes (94%) maintained complete regression. Final visual acuity could be reliably assessed in all 16 eyes (100%), of whom 12 eyes (75%) had visual acuity \u226520\/200. None of the patients developed ocular or systemic complications.\nThree-weekly intravitreal topotecan appears effective and safe in controlling focal or diffuse refractory or recurrent vitreous seeds in retinoblastoma.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000244f","authors":["Raksha Rao","Santosh G Honavar","Vishal Sharma","Vijay Anand P Reddy","Rao, Raksha","Honavar, Santosh G","Sharma, Vishal","Reddy, Vijay Anand P"],"doi":"10.1136\/bjophthalmol-2017-310641","first_seen_on":"2017-08-26T18:46:49+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1468-2079","0007-1161"],"journal":"British Journal of Ophthalmology","last_mentioned_on":1504201565,"links":["http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/early\/2017\/08\/25\/bjophthalmol-2017-310641?rss=1&hootPostID=22b2ecc28b33bb929182f428b060761a","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28844050?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/bjo.bmj.com\/content\/bjophthalmol\/early\/2017\/08\/25\/bjophthalmol-2017-310641.full.pdf","pmid":"28844050","pubdate":"2017-08-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BMJ Publishing Group Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"bjophthalmol-2017-310641","subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Intravitreal topotecan in the management of refractory and recurrent vitreous seeds in retinoblastoma","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8454083,"mean":7.1051250224367,"rank":6110941,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2039519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8454083,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":183570,"mean":12.603918428493,"rank":119252,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":53245,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":183570,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2606,"mean":4.414226487524,"rank":1805,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2606,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77,"mean":3.1780263157895,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":38,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77,"percentile":49}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BMJ_Ophth\/statuses\/901516240010838016","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24363208],"posted_on":"2017-08-26T18:46:35+00:00","author":{"name":"BMJOphthalmology","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/784380801609793536\/NUcJDjri_normal.jpg","description":"News and research updates for ophthalmologists, basic scientists and vision scientists from BMJ.  #ophthalmology","id_on_source":"BMJ_Ophth","tweeter_id":"138746463","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":5397},"tweet_id":"901516240010838016"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/retina_papers\/statuses\/903312955285975040","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[24363208],"posted_on":"2017-08-31T17:46:05+00:00","author":{"name":"retinapapers","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_normal.png","id_on_source":"retina_papers","tweeter_id":"774192480652697600","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":26},"tweet_id":"903312955285975040"}]}}
