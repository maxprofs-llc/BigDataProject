Lower bounds on the dimension can be certified in a device-independent way, based only on observed statistics. We highlight that some such \"dimension witnesses\" capture only the presence of systems of some dimension, which in a sense is trivial, not the capacity of performing information processing on them, which is the point of experimental efforts to control high-dimensional systems. In order to capture this aspect, we introduce the notion of irreducible dimension of a quantum behavior. This dimension can be certified, and we provide a witness for irreducible dimension four.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Wan Cong","Yu Cai","Jean-Daniel Bancal","Valerio Scarani"],"doi":"10.1103\/physrevlett.119.080401","first_seen_on":"2017-08-26T16:39:15+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0031-9007","1079-7114"],"issue":"8","journal":"Physical Review Letters","last_mentioned_on":1504069441,"links":["https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.119.080401","https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.119.080401?utm_content=buffer94660&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.aps.org\/pdf\/10.1103\/PhysRevLett.119.080401","pmid":"28952755","pubdate":"2017-08-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Physical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Physics and Astronomy","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"Witnessing Irreducible Dimension","type":"article","volume":"119","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/witnessing-irreducible-dimension"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0.5,"3m":0.5,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8451184,"mean":7.1040239874029,"rank":6412501,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1149004,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8451184,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":181971,"mean":12.612520338517,"rank":129135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":32923,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":181971,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16727,"mean":11.268462513452,"rank":12227,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":2958,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16727,"percentile":17},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":349,"mean":17.243,"rank":226,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":91,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":349,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
