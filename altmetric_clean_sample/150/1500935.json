A number of studies have described peak torque as one of the best fall-related predictor. No studies have comprehensively focused on the rate of torque development of the lower limb muscles among elderly fallers. Then, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between muscle peak torque and rate of torque development of the lower limb joints in elderly with and without fall history. It was also aimed to determine whether these parameters of muscle performance (i.e., peak torque and rate of torque development) are related to the number of falls.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f61000377e","authors":["Paulo Cesar Barauce Bento","Gleber Pereira","Carlos Ugrinowitsch","Andr\u00e9 Luiz Felix Rodacki"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.clinbiomech.2010.02.002","first_seen_on":"2013-05-23T07:35:42+00:00","issns":["0268-0033"],"issue":"5","journal":"Clinical Biomechanics","last_mentioned_on":1369294292,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0268003310000513"],"pmid":"20350773","pubdate":"2010-03-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biomedicalengineering","physiology"],"title":"Peak torque and rate of torque development in elderly with and without fall history","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peak-torque-rate-torque-development-elderly-without-fall-history"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89692,"mean":7.1488339298258,"rank":61767,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18288,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89692,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":602,"mean":4.3289517470882,"rank":433,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":118,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":602,"percentile":19},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":2.2529411764706,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":4,"Professor > Associate Professor":11,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":9,"Student  > Ph.
