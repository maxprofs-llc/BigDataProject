Samples were taken with universal swab (Biolab\u00ae, Budapest, Hungary) into the Urea-Myco DUO kit (Bio-Rad\u00ae, Budapest, Hungary) and incubated in ambient air for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. The determination of antibiotic sensitivity was performed in U9 and arginin broth using the SIR Mycoplasma kit (Bio-Rad\u00ae, Budapest, Hungary) under the same conditions. Between 01.05.2008 and 31.12.2011, 373\/4,466 (8.35 %) genito-urethral samples with U. urealyticum and 41\/4,466 (0.91 %) genito-urethral samples with M. hominis infection were diagnosed in sexually active individuals in the National STD Center, Semmelweis University. U. urealyticum was isolated in 12.54 % in the cervix and 4.1 % in the male urethra, while M. hominis was isolated in 1.33 % in the cervix and 0.51 % in the male urethra. The affected age group was between 21 and 60 years old. U. urealyticum strains were sensitive to tetracycline (95.9 %), doxycycline (97.32 %), and azithromycin (85.79 %), and resistant to erythromycin (81.23 %), clindamycin (75.06 %), and ofloxacin (25.2 %). Cross-resistance occurred in 38.71 % of patients to erythromycin and clindamycin. M. hominis strains were sensitive to clindamycin, ofloxacin, and doxycycline in more than 95 %, to tetracycline in 82.92 %, and no cross-resistance was detected among the antibiotics. Our study confirms that the continuously changing antibiotic resistance of ureaplasmas and mycoplasmas should be followed at least in a few centers in every country, so as to determine the best local therapy options for sexually transmitted infection (STI) patients.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002828","authors":["P\u00f3nyai K","Mihalik N","Ostorh\u00e1zi E","Farkas B","P\u00e1rducz L","Marschalk\u00f3 M","K\u00e1rp\u00e1ti S","Rozgonyi F"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10096-013-1892-y","first_seen_on":"2013-05-24T05:40:23+00:00","issns":["0934-9723"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases","last_mentioned_on":1371314478,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23686458"],"pmid":"23686458","pubdate":"2013-05-22T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Internal Medicine","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["microbiology","communicablediseases"],"title":"Incidence and antibiotic susceptibility of genital mycoplasmas in sexually active individuals in Hungary.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/incidence-antibiotic-susceptibility-genital-mycoplasmas-sexually-active-individuals-hungary"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":3350650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1481027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94141,"mean":7.299678202677,"rank":59719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":32,"this_scored_higher_than":30233,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94141,"percentile":32},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":703,"mean":1.9797094017094,"rank":413,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":259,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":703,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":2.3192307692308,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
