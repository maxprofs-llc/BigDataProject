The target in humans for EpoR agonists drugs appears clear-to treat anemia. However, there is evidence of the pleitropic actions of erythropoietin (Epo). For that reason, rhEpo therapy was suggested as a reliable approach for treating a broad range of pathologies, including heart and cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease), spinal cord injury, stroke, diabetic retinopathy and rare diseases (Friedreich ataxia). Unfortunately, the side effects of rhEpo are also evident. A new generation of nonhematopoietic EpoR agonists drugs (asialoEpo, Cepo and ARA 290) have been investigated and further developed. These EpoR agonists, without the erythropoietic activity of Epo, while preserving its tissue-protective properties, will provide better outcomes in ongoing clinical trials. Nonhematopoietic EpoR agonists represent safer and more effective surrogates for the treatment of several diseases such as brain and peripheral nerve injury, diabetic complications, renal ischemia, rare diseases, myocardial infarction, chronic heart disease and others.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f610003117","authors":["Sanchis-Gomar F","Perez-Quilis C","Lippi G"],"doi":"10.2119\/molmed.2013.00025","first_seen_on":"2013-05-24T21:27:15+00:00","issns":["1076-1551"],"issue":"","journal":"Molecular Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1369430576,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23615965?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"23615965","pubdate":"2013-04-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) agonism to treat a wide range of diseases.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/erythropoietin-receptor-epor-agonism-used-treat-wide-range-disease"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":3073251,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":951293,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89626,"mean":7.1755494783823,"rank":61087,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":19,"this_scored_higher_than":17678,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89626,"percentile":19},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":249,"mean":2.1821774193548,"rank":150,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":61,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":249,"percentile":24},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":11.38,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Lecturer":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":8,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":4,"Computer Science":1,"Unspecified":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1},"mendeley":{"BR":1,"PT":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Stroke_Wisdom\/statuses\/338042456035696640","license":"public","citation_ids":[1507317],"posted_on":"2013-05-24T21:22:56+00:00","author":{"name":"Stroke OW","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/pfiytpO4PQ","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/63140369\/twitter_image_normal.png","description":"Organizing stroke and mini-stroke resources shared by health experts, advocates, and organizations into WisdomCards.","id_on_source":"Stroke_Wisdom","tweeter_id":"17054021","geo":{"lt":40.71455,"ln":-74.007124,"country":"US"},"followers":317},"tweet_id":"338042456035696640"}]}}
