The situation on university campuses is even more startling, with as many as 1 in 4 female students being victims of rape or attempted rape. The associated physical and mental health effects are extensive and the social and economic costs are staggering. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a novel, small-group sexual assault resistance education program can reduce the incidence of sexual assault among university-attending women, when compared to current university practice of providing informational brochures. METHODS: The trial will evaluate a theoretically and empirically sound four-unit, 12-hour education program that has been demonstrated in pilot studies to have short-term efficacy. Three of the four units provide information, skills, and practice aimed at decreasing the time needed for women to assess situations with elevated risk of acquaintance sexual assault as dangerous and to take action, reducing emotional obstacles to taking action, and increasing the use of the most effective methods of verbal and physical self-defense. The fourth unit focuses on facilitating a stronger positive sexuality from which women may resist sexual coercion by male intimates more successfully. The trial will extend the pilot evaluations by expanding the participant pool and examining the long term efficacy of the program. A total of 1716 first-year female students (age 17 to 24 years) from three Canadian universities will be enrolled. The primary outcome is completed sexual assault, measured by The Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization instrument. Secondary outcomes include changes in knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to the process of sexual assault resistance. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 1 week, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. DISCUSSION: The results of the trial will be used to produce a maximally effective sexual assault resistance education program that can be adopted by universities, to assess whether aspects of the program need to be strengthened, and also to indicate how long the effects of the program last and at which point in time refresher sessions may be necessary.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01338428.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007dd","authors":["Charlene Y Senn","Misha Eliasziw","Paula C Barata","Wilfreda E Thurston","Ian R Newby-Clark","H Lorraine Radtke","Karen L Hobden"],"doi":"10.1186\/1472-6874-13-25","first_seen_on":"2013-05-23T17:32:15+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1472-6874",""],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Women's Health","last_mentioned_on":1434034983,"links":["http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6874\/13\/25\/abstract","http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6874\/13\/25"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/pdf\/1472-6874-13-25.pdf","pmid":"23702221","pubdate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"25","title":"Sexual assault resistance education for university women: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (SARE trial)","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-assault-resistance-education-university-women-study-protocol-randomized-controlled-trial-sare-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":11.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":11.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5558909,"mean":6.3241699877035,"rank":477068,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":5077422,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5558909,"percentile":91},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":97402,"mean":7.3193659613351,"rank":10257,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":87081,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":97402,"percentile":89},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":395,"mean":3.6914720812183,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":366,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":395,"percentile":92},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":7.8153846153846,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Ph.
