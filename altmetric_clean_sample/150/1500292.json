Herein, we report the fabrication of a new porous coordination polymer (PCP)-based composite consisting of a gold nanorod (GNR) used as an optical switch and PCP crystals for controlled molecular release using light irradiation as an external trigger. The delicate core-shell structures of this new platform, composed of an individual GNR core and an aluminum-based PCP shell, were achieved by the selective deposition of an aluminum precursor onto the surface of GNR followed by the replication of the precursor into aluminum-based PCPs. The mesoscopic structure was characterized by electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping, and sorption experiments. Combination at the nanoscale of the high storage capacity of PCPs with the photothermal properties of GNRs resulted in the implementation of unique motion-induced molecular release, triggered by the highly efficient conversion of optical energy into heat that occurs when the GNRs are irradiated into their plasmon band. Temporal control of the molecular release was demonstrated with anthracene as a guest molecule and fluorescent probe by means of fluorescence spectroscopy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Kira Khaletskaya"],"doi":"10.1021\/ja403108x","first_seen_on":"2013-05-22T23:37:40+00:00","issns":["0002-7863"],"journal":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","last_mentioned_on":1373585319,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ja403108x"],"pmid":"23672307","pubdate":"2013-05-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Integration of Porous Coordination Polymers and Gold Nanorods into Core\u2013Shell Mesoscopic Composites toward Light-Induced Molecular Release","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/integration-porous-coordination-polymers-gold-nanorods-coreshell-mesoscopic-composites-toward-lighti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3079622,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":959519,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":89815,"mean":7.1614980069924,"rank":61837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":18320,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":89815,"percentile":20},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15478,"mean":4.1097822575435,"rank":11891,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":2859,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15478,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":570,"mean":4.8122636203866,"rank":408,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":121,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":570,"percentile":21}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":15,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
