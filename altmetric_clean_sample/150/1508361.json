A problem is that PTSD is underdiagnosed and undertreated in people with psychotic disorders. This study's primary goal is to examine the efficacy and safety of prolonged exposure and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) for PTSD in patients with both psychotic disorders and PTSD, as compared to a waiting list. Secondly, the effects of both treatments are determined on (a) symptoms of psychosis, in particular verbal hallucinations, (b) depression and social performance, and (c) economic costs. Thirdly, goals concern links between trauma exposure and psychotic symptomatology and the prevalence of exposure to traumatic events, and of PTSD. Fourthly predictors, moderators, and mediators for treatment success will be explored. These include cognitions and experiences concerning treatment harm, credibility and burden in both participants and therapists.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100008a6","authors":["Paul AJM de Bont","David PG van den Berg","Berber M van der Vleugel","Carlijn de Roos","Cornelis L Mulder","Eni S Becker","Ad de Jongh","Mark van der Gaag","Agnes van Minnen"],"doi":"10.1186\/1745-6215-14-151","first_seen_on":"2013-05-25T12:41:50+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1745-6215"],"issue":"1","journal":"Trials","last_mentioned_on":1431412200,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23702050","http:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/14\/1\/151"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1745-6215-14-151?site=trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com","pmid":"23702050","pubdate":"2013-05-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Trials","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"151","subjects":["medicine"],"title":"A multi-site single blind clinical study to compare the effects of prolonged exposure, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing and waiting list on patients with a current diagnosis of psychosis and co morbid post traumatic stress disorder: study protocol for the randomized controlled trial Treating Trauma in Psychosis","type":"article","volume":"14","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/multisite-single-blind-clinical-study-compare-effects-prolonged-exposure-eye-movement-desensitizatio-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":8.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":8.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5090201,"mean":6.0304483120515,"rank":613217,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":87,"this_scored_higher_than":4474862,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5090201,"percentile":87},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94667,"mean":7.3024539539011,"rank":13370,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":81242,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94667,"percentile":85},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1683,"mean":5.0987360285375,"rank":265,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":1416,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1683,"percentile":84},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63,"mean":3.2084193548387,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":54,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
