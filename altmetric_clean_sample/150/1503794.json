Overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in mice exerts similar metabolic changes in muscle as seen with endurance exercise. Muscular IL-15 production has been shown to increase in mice after weeks of regular endurance running. With the present study we aimed to determine if muscular IL-15 production would increase in human male subjects following 12 weeks of endurance training. In two different studies we obtained plasma and muscle biopsies from young healthy subjects performing: (1) 12 weeks of ergometer cycling exercise five times per week with plasma and biopsies before and after the intervention, and (2) 3 h of ergometer cycling exercise with plasma and biopsies before and after the exercise bout and well into recovery. We measured changes in plasma IL-15, muscle IL-15 mRNA and IL-15 protein. Twelve weeks of regular endurance training induced a 40% increase in basal skeletal muscle IL-15 protein content (p < 0.01), but with no changes in either muscle IL-15 mRNA or plasma IL-15 levels. However, an acute bout of 3-h exercise did not show significant changes in muscle IL-15 or plasma IL-15 levels. The induction of muscle IL-15 protein in humans following a regular training period supports previous findings in mice and emphasizes the hypothesis of IL-15 taking part in skeletal muscle adaptation during training.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6163cf058f610007279","authors":["Rinnov A","Yfanti C","Nielsen S","Akerstr\u00f6m TC","Peijs L","Zankari A","Fischer CP","Pedersen BK","Anders Rinnov","Christina Yfanti","S\u00f8ren Nielsen","Thorbj\u00f6rn C.
