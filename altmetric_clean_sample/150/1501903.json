In 'dry' biomass gasification processes, originating in most coal processing technologies, biomass of low water content is necessary to avoid the energy loss by water evaporation. In contrast, hydrothermal processes need water as reaction medium; therefore, these processes are preferentially used for wet or 'green' biomass. In this review paper we will describe the main research directions in the hydrothermal conversion of biomass into fuels and carbon throughout gasification to produce H2 or CH4, liquefaction to produce crude oils and phenols from lignin as well as carbonization to produce carbonaceous materials which can be either used as fuels (carbon negative chars) or interesting energetic materials (hydrothermal carbons).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026a1","authors":["Andrea Kruse","Axel Funke","Maria-Magdalena Titirici"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.cbpa.2013.05.004","first_seen_on":"2013-05-23T13:35:59+00:00","issns":["13675931"],"journal":"Current Opinion in Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1369315900,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1367593113000938"],"pmid":"23707262","pubdate":"2013-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"title":"Hydrothermal conversion of biomass to fuels and energetic materials","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/hydrothermal-conversion-biomass-fuels-energetic-materials-6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3626860,"mean":4.9517239589446,"rank":2907266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":73129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3626860,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85468,"mean":6.9650817040496,"rank":67478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":186,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85468,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":538,"mean":1.9897541899441,"rank":327,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":538,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":39,"mean":1.1913157894737,"rank":17,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":39,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":3,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
