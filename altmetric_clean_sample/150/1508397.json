This paper proposes the use of the partial proportional odds (PPO) model as a statistical modeling technique that both bridges the gap between ordered and non-ordered response modeling, and avoids violating the key assumptions in the behavior of crash severity inherent in these two alternatives. The partial proportional odds model is a type of logistic regression that allows certain individual predictor variables to ignore the proportional odds assumption which normally forces predictor variables to affect each level of the response variable with the same magnitude, while other predictor variables retain this proportional odds assumption. This research looks at the effectiveness of this PPO technique in predicting vehicular crash severities on Connecticut state roads using data from 1995 to 2009. The PPO model is compared to ordinal and multinomial response models on the basis of adequacy of model fit, significance of covariates, and out-of-sample prediction accuracy. The results of this study show that the PPO model has adequate fit and performs best overall in terms of covariate significance and holdout prediction accuracy. Combined with the ability to accurately represent the theoretical process of crash injury severity prediction, this makes the PPO technique a favorable approach for crash injury severity modeling by adequately modeling and predicting the ordinal nature of the crash severity process and addressing the non-proportional contributions of some covariates.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","doi":"10.1016\/j.aap.2013.04.022","first_seen_on":"2013-05-25T12:47:28+00:00","issns":["1879-2057"],"journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","last_mentioned_on":1396510568,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23702439?dopt=Abstract","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23702439?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"23702439","pubdate":"2013-04-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Transportation And Freight Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Engineering","Physical Sciences"],"title":"Analysis of driver and passenger crash injury severity using partial proportional odds models.","type":"article","volume":"58C","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/analysis-driver-passenger-crash-injury-severity-using-partial-proportional-odds-models"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6228985,"mean":5.9651782765876,"rank":5293594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6228985,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":99376,"mean":7.3391059320755,"rank":81716,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":99376,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1734,"mean":4.6224073860358,"rank":997,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1734,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78,"mean":5.5085194805195,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":5,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
