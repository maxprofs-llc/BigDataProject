It appears in commonly accepted forms in everyday life and more egregious, devastating ways as well. Often extreme manifestations of psychopathy become part of everyday existence, almost taken as normal while its cumulative destructiveness mounts. This paper explores a range of psychopathic states in individuals and groups, including positive and negative contributions these tendencies can make. Psychopathy in individuals and culture interweave in many ways, and some of the latter are discussed.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d4","authors":["Michael Eigen"],"doi":"10.1521\/prev.2016.103.6.729","endpage":"742","first_seen_on":"2016-12-27T08:10:22+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1943-3301","0033-2836"],"issue":"6","journal":"Psychoanalytic Review","last_mentioned_on":1482826209,"links":["http:\/\/guilfordjournals.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1521\/prev.2016.103.6.729"],"pmid":"27893339","pubdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"729","subjects":["psychiatry"],"title":"Psychopathy in Everyday Life","type":"article","volume":"103","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/psychopathy-everyday-life"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7942916,"mean":6.7127945609325,"rank":6874609,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7942916,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252980,"mean":12.493557568019,"rank":207932,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252980,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":137,"mean":2.3996323529412,"rank":125,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":137,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":2.5,"rank":4,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/uranus_2\/statuses\/813658214323490816","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15094286],"posted_on":"2016-12-27T08:10:09+00:00","author":{"name":"\u30de\u30fc\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30fc\uff12\u4e16","url":"http:\/\/smetc.blog120.fc2.com\/?sp","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/650483455248064512\/EOJq3sZX_normal.png","description":"\u5c11\u306a\u304f\u3068\u3082\u5927\u5b66\u521d\u5e74\u6b21\u307e\u3067\u306f\u5834\u9762\u7dd8\u9ed9\u75c7\uff08\u81ea\u5df1\u8a3a\u65ad\uff09\u3060\u3063\u305f\u7537\u3002Twitter\u307e\u3068\u3081(http:\/\/psychobrain.seesaa.net\/)\u3002 \u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9805\u2460\u8ad6\u6587\u306f\u8981\u7d04\u3057\u304b\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u306a\u3044\u5834\u5408\u304c\u591a\u3044\u2461\u9593\u9055\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3042\u308a\u2462\u79c1\u306f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002","id_on_source":"uranus_2","tweeter_id":"253847599","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":3418},"tweet_id":"813658214323490816"}]}}
