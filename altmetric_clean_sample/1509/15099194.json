Compared with the CO2 hydrogenation using the Cu-Fe-Ce\/HZSM-5 alone, the CO2 conversion and the dimethyl ether (DME) selectivity for the plasma-catalytic process were increased by 16.3%, and 10.1%, respectively, indicating the CO2 was activated by the plasma and promoted the CO2 hydrogenation. The intrinsic kinetics study shown that the activation energies of the methanol synthesis, the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and the methanol dehydration to DME were 149.34 kJ\u00b7mol-1, 75.47 kJ\u00b7mol-1, and 73.18 kJ\u00b7mol-1, respectively, which were lower than that of using Cu-Fe-Ce\/HZSM-5 without plasma, indicating that the activation of CO2 in the plasma can reduce the activation energy of the hydrogenation reaction and improve the yield of DME.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63b3cf058f610008dda","authors":["Su, Tongming","Zhou, Xinhui","Qin, Zuzeng","Ji, Hongbing"],"doi":"10.1002\/cphc.201601283","first_seen_on":"2016-12-27T13:13:33+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1439-7641"],"journal":"ChemPhysChem","last_mentioned_on":1484186630,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201601283\/abstract;jsessionid=60D183ABD97B6FE70F9A1CAF7798FB18.f04t03","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201601283\/abstract;jsessionid=E845360F0B190F816BCF42B651D34C77.f04t01","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201601283\/abstract;jsessionid=AD640D867ED27C2CE0EE9B63F4FF9410.f03t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+Journal+subscribe+and+renew+pages+for+some+journals+will+be+unavailable+on+Wednesday+11th+January+2017+from+06%3A00-12%3A00+GMT+%2F+01%3A00-07%3A00+EST+%2F+14%3A00-20%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.+Apologies+for+the+inconvenience","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201601283\/abstract;jsessionid=DA2C91827A55E93B11018EE0127BDDCA.f01t02"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/cphc.201601283\/pdf","pmid":"27898184","pubdate":"2016-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical Chemistry (Incl.
