However, the inherent invasiveness of orthognathic surgery often leads to a high complication rate. Facial fat grafting could be a less invasive method to correct facial deformities.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the results of microfat grafting for facial contouring.\nThis retrospective chart review evaluated 166 patients who were treated with microfat grafting for maxillary and\/or mandibular hypoplasia. Pretreatment and posttreatment photographs were compared regarding improvement of facial contour, and complications were recorded.\nThe follow-up period ranged from 4 months to 10 years (mean, 2 years 7 months). Thirty-eight percent of the patients had a refill procedure 6 or more months after the first procedure. A majority of the evaluated patients stated that they benefited from the microfat grafting, with ratings of excellent (50%), sufficient (48%), and poor (2%). Complications included visible fat lobules under the lower eyelid skin (7%), which was seen during the first 4 years and was resolved by changing the injection cannulae and technique, and fat resorption, which was seen in all patients, with a clinical range from \u00b115% in the immobile malar area and chin region to \u00b150% in the mobile lip area.\nFacial microfat grafting is a valuable alternative to more complicated advancement osetotomies being performed in patients solely for aesthetic reasons. The low morbidity and rapid recovery make facial microfat grafting a welcome tool in the armamentarium of the modern facial aesthetic surgeon.\n4 Therapeutic.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f6100068e7","authors":["Lindenblatt, Nicole","van Hulle, Astrid","Verpaele, Alexis M","Tonnard, Patrick L"],"doi":"10.1093\/asj\/sjv083","first_seen_on":"2015-06-06T16:59:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1527-330X"],"journal":"Aesthetic Surgery Journal","last_mentioned_on":1444236552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26038369","http:\/\/asj.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/35\/7\/763"],"pmid":"26038369","pubdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery"],"title":"The Role of Microfat Grafting in Facial Contouring","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/role-microfat-grafting-facial-contouring"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6265888,"mean":5.9560405915417,"rank":2478279,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":3724942,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6265888,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":174277,"mean":8.9935413941107,"rank":76067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":95027,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":174277,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":501,"mean":12.13524,"rank":288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":40,"this_scored_higher_than":205,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":501,"percentile":40},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37,"mean":20.7485,"rank":21,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37,"percentile":35}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"practitioner":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":2,"Other":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1,"Professor":2},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":9,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1,"FR":1,"US":1},"mendeley":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ducrest\/status\/607230219280392192","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4106102],"posted_on":"2015-06-06T16:59:00+00:00","author":{"name":"Dominique du Crest","url":"http:\/\/www.skinaid.eu\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1474773419\/image_normal.jpg","description":"#Evidence as guiding star!Curating #skin science.
