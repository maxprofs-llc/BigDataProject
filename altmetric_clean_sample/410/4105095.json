It has been active since 2001 and web-based since 2004. It runs on government funding only and is used in all Swedish neurology departments. The SMSreg currently includes data on 14,500 of Sweden's estimated 17,500 prevalent patients with MS. One important function of SMSreg, to which participation is voluntary, is to serve as a tool for decision support and to provide an easy overview of the patient information needed at clinical visits. This is its core feature and explains why the majority of Swedish MS specialists contribute data. Another success factor for SMSreg is that entered data can be readily accessed, either through a query function into Excel format or through a set of predesigned tables and diagrams in which parameters can be selected. Recent development includes a portal allowing patients to view a summary of their registered data and to report a set of patient-reported outcomes. SMSreg data have been used in close to 100 published scientific reports. Current projects include an incidence cohort (EIMS), post-marketing cohorts of patients on novel disease-modifying drugs (IMSE), and a prevalence cohort (GEMS). As these studies combine physical sampling and questionnaire data with clinical documentation and possible linkage to other public registries, together they provide an excellent platform for integrated MS research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002158","authors":["Hillert, J","Stawiarz, L"],"doi":"10.1111\/ane.12425","first_seen_on":"2015-06-06T12:03:23+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1600-0404"],"journal":"Acta Neurologica Scandinavica","last_mentioned_on":1433738481,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26046553?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26046553","pubdate":"2015-06-06T22:08:09+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"The Swedish MS registry - clinical support tool and scientific resource.","type":"article","volume":"132 Suppl S199","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/swedish-ms-registry-clinical-support-tool-scientific-resource"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5204211,"mean":6.1399971899698,"rank":2312456,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":2834214,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5204211,"percentile":54},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176404,"mean":8.7967659960433,"rank":78220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":94855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176404,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":788,"mean":2.88974841169,"rank":345,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":431,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":788,"percentile":54},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":2.7557727272727,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":26,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
