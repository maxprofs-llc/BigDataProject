Secondary outcomes were number of glaucoma medications and postoperative complications.\nDiagnoses were primary open-angle glaucoma (32%), chronic angle-closure glaucoma (26%), and secondary open-angle glaucoma (OAG, 42%); 50\/53 of subjects had 6 months' and 28\/53 had 12 months' follow-up data. Preoperative IOP was 27.9\u00b17.5 mm Hg (mean\u00b1SD). Postoperative IOP at 6 mo was 10.2\u00b15.6 and at 12 mo was 10.7\u00b15.2 lower than preoperative levels (all P<0.0001). Cumulative treatment success was 81% at 6 mo and 78% at 12 mo. Number of medications fell from 3.4\u00b11.2 pretreatment to 0.8\u00b11.0 at 1 to 6 mo and 0.7\u00b11.2 at 12 mo postoperatively (all P<0.0001). Complications in the initial postoperative period (<3 mo) were hypotony (3\/53, 6%), fibrinous uveitis (2\/53, 4%), and cystoid macular edema without hypotony (CME; 4\/53, 6%). Complications beyond 6 mo occurred in 8\/50 (16%) subjects as hypotony (4\/50, 8%), choroidal detachment (4\/50, 3 with IOP<5 and 1 with IOP\u22655; 8%), CME without hypotony (3\/50, 6%), and failed corneal graft (1\/50, 2%).\nThe mean IOP was lowered by at least 61% after ECP-plus and IOP lowering was sustained over the follow-up period. Fewer glaucoma medications were needed. Complication rates were comparable with or slightly higher than anterior endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation and acceptable given the refractory nature of disease being treated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007ca9","authors":["Tan, James C H","Francis, Brian A","Noecker, Robert","Uram, Martin","Dustin, Laurie","Chopra, Vikas","Tan, James C.H.","Francis, Brian A."],"doi":"10.1097\/ijg.0000000000000278","first_seen_on":"2015-06-06T13:07:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1536-481X","1057-0829"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Glaucoma","last_mentioned_on":1458993733,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Abstract\/publishahead\/Endoscopic_Cyclophotocoagulation_and_Pars_Plana.99104.aspx","http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Abstract\/2016\/03000\/Endoscopic_Cyclophotocoagulation_and_Pars_Plana.17.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/9000\/00000\/Endoscopic_Cyclophotocoagulation_and_Pars_Plana.99104.pdf","pmid":"26020690","pubdate":"2015-05-26T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation and Pars Plana Ablation (ECP-Plus) to Treat Refractory Glaucoma.","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/glaucomajournal\/Fulltext\/2016\/03000\/Endoscopic_Cyclophotocoagulation_and_Pars_Plana.17.aspx","volume":"Publish Ahead of Print","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endoscopic-cyclophotocoagulation-pars-plana-ablation-ecpplus-treat-refractory-glaucoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7441664,"mean":6.4677569293272,"rank":5370056,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1810240,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7441664,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":217893,"mean":8.2775446092561,"rank":139733,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":65177,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":217893,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1330,"mean":1.5951437170805,"rank":621,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":524,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1330,"percentile":39},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":50,"mean":1.684693877551,"rank":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":50,"percentile":28}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":4,"Other":2,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":11}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"RU":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JOGJournal\/status\/607171836959289344","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[4105285],"posted_on":"2015-06-06T13:07:01+00:00","author":{"name":"Journal of Glaucoma","url":"http:\/\/www.glaucomajournal.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1376189460\/JOGcover_normal.jpg","description":"JOG provides a stimulating forum for discussion of clinical, scientific, and socioeconomic issues of concern to clinicians who care for glaucoma patients.","id_on_source":"JOGJournal","tweeter_id":"308497783","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":479},"tweet_id":"607171836959289344"},{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EyeNews_ru\/status\/607172938371088385","license":"datasift","rt":["JOGJournal"],"citation_ids":[4105285],"posted_on":"2015-06-06T13:11:23+00:00","author":{"name":"EyeNews_ru","url":"http:\/\/www.EyeNews.ru","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/747009588835328000\/-t2uPxm3_normal.jpg","description":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432 \u0422\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435! \u0417\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u043a \u043d\u0430\u043c!
