However, the arrangement of staging groups assumes that these factors are independent variables. A retrospective review of 359 consecutive patients undergoing esophageal resection was conducted to define the relationship between T and N and to determine whether T is a significant predictor of regional lymph node metastasis (N1).\nPrimary treatment was operation without preoperative therapy. There were 295 (82%) adenocarcinomas, 55 (15%) squamous cell carcinomas, and 9 (3%) adenosquamous carcinomas. T status was Tis in 29 (8%) patients, T1 in 65 (18%), T2 in 37 (10%), T3 in 219 (61%), and T4 in 9 (3%). N status was N0 in 161 (45%) patients and N1 in 198 (55%). M status was M0 in 327 (91%) patients and M1 in 32 (9%). Stage was 0 in 29 (8%) patients, I in 58 (16%), IIA in 70 (20%), IIB in 22 (6%), III in 148 (41%), and IV in 32 (9%).\nThe likelihood of N1 disease occurring with increasing T was tested using the trend test. The percentage of patients with N1 disease is 0% for Tis, 11% for T1, 43% for T2, 77% for T3, and 67% for T4 (p < 0.001). This relationship existed for both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariable analysis identified increasing T, adenocarcinoma, and lack of well-differentiated histologic features as significant predictors of N1 disease. Compared with a T1 patient, a T2 patient is 6 times more likely to have N1 disease, a T3 patient 23 times, and a T4 patient 35 times.\nWe conclude that for patients with esophageal carcinoma, T is an important predictor of N and this association should be included with other established factors used in clinical staging and treatment decisions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f610006a35","authors":["Rice, T W","Zuccaro, G","Adelstein, D J","Rybicki, L A","Blackstone, E H","Goldblum, J R"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T23:52:27+00:00","issns":["0003-4975"],"issue":"3","journal":"The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1430998878,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9527214"],"pmid":"9527214","pubdate":"1998-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Esophageal carcinoma: depth of tumor invasion is predictive of regional lymph node status.","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/esophageal-carcinoma-depth-tumor-invasion-predictive-regional-lymph-node-status-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5067569,"mean":6.0017903301953,"rank":1251191,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3222174,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5067569,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":171986,"mean":8.75099153996,"rank":55197,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":113659,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":171986,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2388,"mean":2.3896899874319,"rank":230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":1879,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2388,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86,"mean":1.4688235294118,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":79,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86,"percentile":91}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
