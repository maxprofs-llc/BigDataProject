New sequence data (5S genes of D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. orena, and D. takahashii) and already-published data (5S genes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. teissieri) are used in these comparisons. We show that four regions within the Drosophila 5S genes display distinct rates of evolution: the coding region (120 bp), the 5'-flanking region (54-55 bp), the 3'-flanking region (21-22 bp), and the internal spacer (149-206 bp). Intra- and interspecific heterogeneity is due mainly to insertions and deletions of 6-17-bp oligomers. These small rearrangements could be generated by fork slippages during replication and could produce rapid sequence divergence in a limited number of steps.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e60","authors":["P\u00e4ques, F","Samson, M L","Jordan, P","Wegnez, M"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-06T04:09:59+00:00","issns":["0022-2844"],"issue":"5","journal":"Journal of Molecular Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1337746134,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7490776"],"pmid":"7490776","pubdate":"1995-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Genetics","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology"],"title":"Structural evolution of the Drosophila 5S ribosomal genes.","type":"article","volume":"41","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/structural-evolution-drosophila-5s-ribosomal-genes-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3852006,"mean":5.0340553609531,"rank":884423,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":2433515,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3852006,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":63946,"mean":7.4717968566737,"rank":18521,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":43795,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":63946,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":595,"mean":3.0676256323777,"rank":102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":198,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":595,"percentile":33},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":2.0642857142857,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":[],"by_discipline":[]}}},"posts":{"wikipedia":[{"title":"Ribosomal DNA","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?diff=prev&oldid=493935721#altmetric_citation_1","license":"public","citation_ids":[4103321],"posted_on":"2012-05-23T04:08:54+00:00","summary":"Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a DNA sequence that codes for ribosomal RNA.
