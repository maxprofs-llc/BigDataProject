In this study, the effects of NaCl (50-200 mM) on expression of high-affinity potassium transporters (HKTs), antioxidant enzymes and their isozyme profiles were investigated in two contrasting bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes viz., HD2329 (salt-sensitive) and Kharchia65 (salt-tolerant). Kharchia65 can successfully grow in salt affected soils, while HD2329 cannot tolerate salt stress. Differential expression studies of two HKT genes (TaHKT2;1.1 and TaHKT2;3.1) revealed their up-regulated expression (-1.5-fold) in the salt-sensitive HD2329 and down-regulated (-5-fold) inducible expression in the salt-tolerant genotype (Kharchia65). Specific activity of antioxidant enzymes, viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) was found to be higher in the salt-tolerant genotype. Isozyme profile of two (POX and GR) antioxidant enzymes showed polymorphism between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes. A new gene TaHKT2;3.1 was also identified and its expression profile and role in salt stress tolerance in wheat was also studied. Partial sequences of the TaHKT2;1.1 and TaHKT2;3.1 genes from bread wheat were submitted to the EMBL GenBank database. Our findings indicated that defence responses to salt stress were induced differentially in contrasting bread wheat genotypes which provide evidences for functional correlation between salt stress tolerance and differential biochemical and molecular expression patterns in bread wheat.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9123cf058f61000cca7","authors":["Singh, Archana","Bhushan, Bharat","Gaikwad, Kishor","Yadav, O P","Kumar, Suresh","Rai, R D"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T16:35:24+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0301-1208"],"issue":"1","journal":"Indian journal of biochemistry biophysics","last_mentioned_on":1433521390,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26040114?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"26040114","pubdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biophysics","biochemistry"],"title":"Induced defence responses of contrasting bread wheat genotypes under differential salt stress imposition.","type":"article","volume":"52","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/induced-defence-responses-contrasting-bread-wheat-genotypes-under-differential-salt-stress-impositio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5190641,"mean":6.1260720832137,"rank":4320156,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5190641,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":175121,"mean":8.7709922110554,"rank":143214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":175121,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":69,"mean":1.9334411764706,"rank":47,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":69,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
