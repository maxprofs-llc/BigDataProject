It is a unique dipeptidyl alcohol, consisting of a uracil acrylic acid moiety and a monooxo-dithioacetal group. To elucidate the biosynthetic logic of sparsomycin, a biosynthetic gene cluster for sparsomycin was identified from the producer Streptomyces sparsogenes by genome mining, targeted gene mutations, and heterologous expression. Both the genetic and enzymatic studies revealed a minimum set of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases needed for generating the dipeptidyl alcohol scaffold of sparsomycin, featuring unusual mechanisms in dipeptidyl assembly and offloading.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6073cf058f610006811","authors":["Rui, Zhe","Huang, Wei","Xu, Fei","Han, Mo","Liu, Xinyu","Lin, Shuangjun","Zhang, Wenjun"],"doi":"10.1021\/acschembio.5b00284","first_seen_on":"2015-06-06T10:20:48+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1554-8937"],"journal":"ACS Chemical Biology","last_mentioned_on":1433903998,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26046698?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/acschembio.5b00284"],"pmid":"26046698","pubdate":"2015-06-06T22:08:04+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biology","biochemistry"],"title":"Sparsomycin Biosynthesis Highlights Unusual Module Architecture and Processing Mechanism in Non-ribosomal Peptide Synthetase","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sparsomycin-biosynthesis-highlights-unusual-module-architecture-processing-mechanism-nonribosomal-pe"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5214547,"mean":6.1508528861404,"rank":2402157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":51,"this_scored_higher_than":2681964,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5214547,"percentile":51},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":176605,"mean":8.8041929288126,"rank":82875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":87571,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":176605,"percentile":49},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1222,"mean":4.017868959869,"rank":479,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1222,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":5.3538181818182,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
