In this study, subjects (n\u00a0 = \u00a08) performed ramped and sustained isometric contractions (ankle plantar flexion and knee flexion; range: \u223c1-40%\u00a0maximal voluntary contraction) and we measured MU territory size with spike-triggered averages from fine-wire electrodes inserted along the length (7 electrodes) or across the width (5 electrodes) of the MG muscle. Of 69\u00a0MUs along the muscle, 32\u00a0MUs spanned at least half the muscle length (\u2265\u00a06.9\u00a0cm), 11 of which spanned all recording sites (13.6\u00a0to 17.9\u00a0cm). Distal fibres had smaller pennation angles (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which were accompanied by larger territories in MUs with fibres located distally (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was no distal-to-proximal pattern of muscle activation in ramp contraction (p\u00a0 = \u00a00.93). Of 36 MUs across the muscle, 24\u00a0MUs spanned at least half the muscle width (\u2265\u00a04.0\u00a0cm), 13 of which spanned all recording sites (8.0\u00a0to 10.8\u00a0cm). Motor units were not localized (length or width) based on recruitment threshold or contraction type, nor was there a relationship between MU territory size and recruitment threshold (Spearman's rho\u00a0 = \u00a0-0.20 and 0.13, p\u00a0>\u00a00.18). Motor units in the human MG have larger territories than previously reported and are not localized based on recruitment threshold or joint action. This indicates that the CNS does not have the means to selectively activate regions of the MG muscle based on task requirements. This article is protected by copyright.
