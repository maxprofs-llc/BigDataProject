Four patients were male; five were female. Patients' ages ranged from 8 years to 35 years (median, 12 years). The follow-up interval ranged from 1 month to 10 years (median, 4 years). These peripheral retinal elevations had a tendency to remain stable, although those with telangiectatic vessels or vasoproliferative tumors occasionally demonstrated an increase in accumulation of exudate. Treatment of such eyes with cryotherapy, or low-dose plaque radiotherapy, resulted in vasoproliferative tumor and telangiectatic vessel regression, absorption of the hard exudate, and resolution of the retinal elevation in four of five eyes. One patient had spontaneous regression of the retinoschisis cavity over a 4-year period.\nPatients with pars planitis may present with bullous retinoschisis and\/or exudative retinal detachment. These findings may be related to a Coats disease-like vascular response (telangiectatic vessels and vasoproliferative tumors) secondary to chronic inflammation. Treatment of the vascular leakage tended to result in resolution of the detachment and\/or schisis.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008765","authors":["Pollack, Aryeh L","McDonald, H Richard","Johnson, Robert N","Ai, Everett","Irvine, Alexander R","Lahey, J Michael","Lewis, Hilel","Rodriguez, Alvaro","Ryan, Edwin H","Shields, Carol L"],"first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T19:00:08+00:00","issns":["0275-004X"],"issue":"6","journal":"Retina","last_mentioned_on":1430163835,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12476097"],"pmid":"12476097","pubdate":"2002-12-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"title":"Peripheral retinoschisis and exudative retinal detachment in pars planitis.","type":"article","volume":"22","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/peripheral-retinoschisis-exudative-retinal-detachment-pars-planitis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5033220,"mean":5.9655498050018,"rank":1240899,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3197841,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5033220,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":172566,"mean":8.7064781502622,"rank":55437,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":113968,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":172566,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1077,"mean":1.0843215613383,"rank":59,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":989,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1077,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93,"mean":1.1157608695652,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":87,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93,"percentile":93}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
