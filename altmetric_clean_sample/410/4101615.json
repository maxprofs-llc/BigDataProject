This makes Boxgrove 1 one of the older known and systematically aged Middle Pleistocene hominid specimens, and it reinforces the pattern of an underrepresentation of older adults observed in Middle and Late Pleistocene archaic Homo samples.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002de3","authors":["Streeter, M","Stout, S D","Trinkaus, E","Stringer, C B","Roberts, M B","Parfitt, S A"],"doi":"10.1006\/jhev.2001.0460","first_seen_on":"2015-06-05T21:21:15+00:00","issns":["0047-2484","00472484"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Human Evolution","last_mentioned_on":1427051179,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0047248401904609"],"pmid":"11312585","pubdate":"2001-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Evolutionary Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Archaeology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["anthropology","biology"],"title":"Histomorphometric age assessment of the Boxgrove 1 tibial diaphysis ","type":"article","volume":"40","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/histomorphometric-age-assessment-boxgrove-1-tibial-diaphysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4901725,"mean":5.8260192838313,"rank":1199055,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":3110170,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4901725,"percentile":63},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":168176,"mean":8.6625577404491,"rank":53908,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":111180,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":168176,"percentile":66},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":967,"mean":11.60532505176,"rank":523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":231,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":967,"percentile":23},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":22.425272727273,"rank":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":43}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Researcher":9,"Student  > Ph.
