Little is known about the therapist-made or commercially available bubble-PEP devices. The aim of this study was to determine the end-expiratory pressures (cm H2O) and oscillation frequencies (Hz) generated when a range of flows were applied to the therapist-made bubble-PEP devices (Bubble-PEP-3cm and Bubble-PEP-0cm) and commercial bubble-PEP devices (AguaPEP, Hydrapep, and Therabubble).\nThis was a bench-top experimental study using a compressed air source, flow rotameter (flows of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 L\/min), and pressure transducer. Data were collected using a data acquisition device with PhysioDAQxs software and analyzed with Breathalyser software to determine the pressures and oscillation frequencies generated by 5 bubble-PEP devices. Each flow was constant for a 30-s measurement period, and measurements were repeated in triplicate. The 5 devices were: a therapist-made Bubble-PEP-3cm device (filled with 13 cm of water, tubing resting 3 cm from the base of the container); the therapist-made Bubble-PEP-0cm (filled with 10 cm of water, tubing resting at the base of the container); and the AguaPEP, Hydrapep, and Therabubble devices with water to the 10 cm mark on the containers.\nFlows of 5-25 L\/min produced the following mean \u00b1 SD PEP and oscillation frequencies (Hz): the Bubble-PEP-3cm produced PEP of 10.4 \u00b1 0.14 to 10.8 \u00b1 0.24 cm H2O, oscillations between 13 and 17 Hz; the Bubble-PEP-0cm produced PEP of 10.9 \u00b1 0.01 to 12.9 \u00b1 0.08 cm H2O, oscillations between 12 and 14 Hz; the AguaPEP produced PEP from 9.7 \u00b1 0.02 to 11.5 \u00b1 0.02 cm H2O, oscillations between 11 and 17 Hz; the Hydrapep produced PEP of 9.6 \u00b1 0.35 to 10.7 \u00b1 0.39 cm H2O, oscillations between 14 and 17 Hz; and the Therabubble produced PEP from 8.6 \u00b1 0.01 to 12.8 \u00b1 0.03 cm H2O, oscillations between 14 and 17 Hz.\nBubble-PEP-3cm maintained the most stable pressure throughout the range of flows tested. All devices investigated produced similar oscillation frequencies.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5eb3cf058f610005ca2","authors":["Mary D Santos","Maree A Milross","John P Eisenhuth","Jennifer A Alison"],"doi":"10.4187\/respcare.05164","first_seen_on":"2017-02-02T22:03:29+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["0020-1324","1943-3654"],"journal":"Respiratory Care","last_mentioned_on":1493053338,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28143962","http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/content\/62\/4\/444"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/content\/respcare\/62\/4\/444.full.pdf","pmid":"28143962","pubdate":"2017-02-02T22:03:29+00:00","publisher":"Respiratory Care","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Pressures and Oscillation Frequencies Generated by Bubble-Positive Expiratory Pressure Devices","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/rc.rcjournal.com\/lookup\/doi\/10.4187\/respcare.05164"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":4.7,"6m":4.7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8093859,"mean":6.8854427063012,"rank":1643525,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":79,"this_scored_higher_than":6441615,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8093859,"percentile":79},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260205,"mean":12.898660112834,"rank":74216,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":185405,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260205,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":827,"mean":4.101196125908,"rank":176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":650,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":827,"percentile":78},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":5.8868421052632,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":5,"practitioner":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":2,"Members of the public":5}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"AU":2,"GB":3}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/georgentou1\/statuses\/827276224783265794","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16061405],"posted_on":"2017-02-02T22:03:16+00:00","author":{"name":"GeorgeNtoumenopoulos","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/598014991996833792\/Qz5RX64Z_normal.jpg","description":"Physiotherapist working at GSH, University of Technology Sydney and St Vincent's Hospital.
