The effects of dilutions (1:10 and 1:100), incubation times (6-8 and 18-21 h), and incubation temperatures (35 and 42 degree) were determined. Recovery of V.cholerae was significantly greater (P<0.05) from oyster homogenates diluted 1:100 in alkaline peptone water and incubated at 42 degree C for 18-21 h. This enrichment procedure also provided the best detection of the cholera toxin gene by polymerase chain reaction.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5073cf058f61000310f","authors":["Angelo DePaola","Gyu-Chul Hwang"],"doi":"10.1016\/s0890-8508(95)80031-x","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T06:44:34+00:00","handles":[],"issns":["08908508","0890-8508"],"issue":"2","journal":"Molecular & Cellular Probes","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/S0890-8508(95)80031-X"],"pmid":"7603474","pubdate":"1995-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","cellbiology","biotechnology"],"title":"Effect of dilution, incubation time, and temperature of enrichment on cultural and PCR detection of Vibrio cholerae obtained from the oyster Crassostrea virginica","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S089085089580031X","volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/effect-dilution-incubation-time-temperature-enrichment-cultural-pcr-detection-vibrio-cholerae-obtain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8080265,"mean":6.8940341290757,"rank":2034769,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":61,"this_scored_higher_than":4956825,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8080265,"percentile":61},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":260414,"mean":12.874786719557,"rank":91198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":164666,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":260414,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":187,"mean":2.184,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":114,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":187,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
