Participants were randomised to receive either a brief or extended feedback version of the Grassessment program and were required to complete a one month follow up questionnaire.\nOne hundred and ninety four participants completed the one month follow up. Wilcoxon analyses showed a significant decrease in past month quantity and frequency of cannabis use (ps<0.001; r=-0.41 and -0.40 respectively) and lower severity of dependence scores (p=0.002; r=-0.31) among those in the brief feedback condition. Participants in the extended feedback group also demonstrated significant decreases in patterns of use (ps<0.002; r=-0.39 and -0.33) but not severity of dependence (p=0.09; r=0.18). A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis showed no significant interaction between length of feedback received and past month cannabis use frequency (p=0.78), quantity (p=0.73), or severity of dependence (p=0.47).\nThis study adds support for the use of brief online self-complete interventions to reduce cannabis use and related problems in the short term. The findings suggest that in the case of the brief online screening and feedback program Grassessment, extended feedback does not lead to superior outcomes over brief feedback.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f45","authors":["Copeland, Jan","Rooke, Sally","Rodriquez, Dan","Norberg, Melissa M","Gibson, Lisa","Jan Copeland","Sally Rooke","Dan Rodriquez","Melissa M.
