Mechanistic investigations on active-site model compounds, which are synthesized by rational design to incorporate systematic variations, can focus on and resolve answers to fundamental questions, including protonation and\/or H-bonding aspects, which accompany electron transfer. Here, we describe the nature and comparative reactivity of two low-spin heme-peroxo-Cu complexes, LS-4DCHIm, [(DCHIm)F8Fe(III)-(O2(2-))-Cu(II)(DCHIm)4](+), and LS-3DCHIm, [(DCHIm)F8Fe(III)-(O2(2-))-Cu(II)(DCHIm)3](+) (F8 = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)-porphyrinate; DCHIm = 1,5-dicyclohexylimidazole), toward different proton (4-nitrophenol and [DMF\u00b7H(+)](CF3SO3(-))) (DMF = dimethyl-formamide) or electron (decamethylferrocene (Fc*)) sources. Spectroscopic reactivity studies show that differences in structure and electronic properties of LS-3DCHIm and LS-4DCHIm lead to significant differences in behavior. LS-3DCHIm is resistant to reduction, is unreactive toward weakly acidic 4-NO2-phenol, and stronger acids cleave the metal-O bonds, releasing H2O2. By contrast, LS-4DCHIm forms an adduct with 4-NO2-phenol, which includes an H-bond to the peroxo O-atom distal to Fe (resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy and DFT). With addition of Fc* (2 equiv overall required), O-O reductive cleavage occurs, giving water, Fe(III), and Cu(II) products; however, a kinetic study reveals a one-electron rate-determining process, ket = 1.6 M(-1) s(-1) (-90 \u00b0C). The intermediacy of a high-valent [(DCHIm)F8Fe(IV)\u2550O] species is thus implied, and separate experiments show that one-electron reduction-protonation of [(DCHIm)F8Fe(IV)\u2550O] occurs faster (ket2 = 5.0 M(-1) s(-1)), consistent with the overall postulated mechanism. The importance of the H-bonding interaction as a prerequisite for reductive cleavage is highlighted.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f56","authors":["Suzanne M.
