Recent studies have indicated that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is related to the development and progression of human carcinomas. However, further studies were required to confirm the roles played by HMGB1 in clinical prostate cancer treatment. We investigated the relationship between HMGB1 expression and the characteristics of prostate cancer, and also evaluated the significance of HMGB1 as a prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245a","authors":["Li, Tao","Gui, Yaping","Yuan, Tao","Liao, Guoqiang","Bian, Cuidong","Jiang, Qiquan","Huang, Shengsong","Liu, Bo","Wu, Denglong"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1464-410x.2012.11277.x","endpage":"E1130","first_seen_on":"2012-06-06T16:35:25+00:00","issns":["1464-410X","1464-4096"],"issue":"11c","journal":"British Journal of Urology","last_mentioned_on":1339000475,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11277.x\/abstract;jsessionid=93C8F2EE9279132909A892427B0CC4E4.d02t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+9+June+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11277.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1464-410X.2012.11277.x\/pdf","pmid":"22672360","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"E1125","title":"Overexpression of high mobility group box 1 with poor prognosis in patients after radical prostatectomy","type":"article","volume":"110","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/overexpression-high-mobility-group-box-1-poor-prognosis-patients-after-radical-prostatectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8163518,"mean":6.8970466082141,"rank":6202749,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1094985,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8163518,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95175,"mean":5.6276098094017,"rank":62763,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":16852,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95175,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3064,"mean":6.4715337904016,"rank":2430,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":10,"this_scored_higher_than":314,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3064,"percentile":10},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":45,"mean":4.0704545454545,"rank":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":45,"percentile":2}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
