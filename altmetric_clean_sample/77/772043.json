Benefits include no visible scars, less pain, and shorter recovery time. We describe a video of a 37-year-old female who underwent a pure transvaginal appendectomy (TVA) for acute appendicitis. This is 1 of 18 successfully performed TVAs at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Appropriate Institutional Review Board was obtained preoperatively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100035f7","doi":"10.1007\/s00464-012-2319-z","first_seen_on":"2012-06-01T10:00:43+00:00","issns":["1432-2218"],"journal":"Surgical Endoscopy","last_mentioned_on":1338544833,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22648096?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22648096","pubdate":"2012-05-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["generalsurgery","diagnosticimaging","gastroenterology"],"title":"Pure transvaginal laparoscopic appendectomy.","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/pure-transvaginal-laparoscopic-appendectomy"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3634361,"mean":4.9198212791297,"rank":2898108,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81918,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3634361,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":73049,"mean":4.4446362391851,"rank":52875,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":420,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":73049,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1821,"mean":1.9373186813187,"rank":1221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1821,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":131,"mean":0.88384615384615,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":131,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Master":1,"Professor":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":4,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":1}}},"geo":{"mendeley":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cirugiaF\/statuses\/208498259860267009","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[772043],"posted_on":"2012-06-01T10:00:33+00:00","author":{"name":"Cirug\u00eda","url":"http:\/\/fabumed.net\/ume\/cirugia\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1565649616\/favicon_normal.ico","description":"Herramienta para buscar, compartir, revisar y referenciar autores latinoamericanos que contribuyen a fortalecer la literatura m\u00e9dica de Latinoam\u00e9rica","id_on_source":"cirugiaF","tweeter_id":"382282545","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":441},"tweet_id":"208498259860267009"}]}}
