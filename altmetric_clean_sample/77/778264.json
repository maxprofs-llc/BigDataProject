Depending on the task, about 50%-80% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulties in maintaining SPEM. We designed a study that comprised different target velocities as well as testing for internal (extraretinal) guidance of SPEM in the absence of a visual target. We applied event-related fMRI by presenting four velocities (5, 10, 15, 20\u00b0\/s) both with and without intervals of target blanking. 17 patients and 16 healthy participants were included. Eye movements were registered during scanning sessions. Statistical analysis included mixed ANOVAs and regression analyses of the target velocity on the Blood Oxygen Level Dependency (BOLD) signal. The main effect group and the interaction of velocity\u00d7group revealed reduced activation in V5 and putamen but increased activation of cerebellar regions in patients. Regression analysis showed that activation in supplementary eye field, putamen, and cerebellum was not correlated to target velocity in patients in contrast to controls. Furthermore, activation in V5 and in intraparietal sulcus (putative LIP) bilaterally was less strongly correlated to target velocity in patients than controls. Altered correlation of target velocity and neural activation in the cortical network supporting SPEM (V5, SEF, LIP, putamen) implies impaired transformation of the visual motion signal into an adequate motor command in patients. Cerebellar regions seem to be involved in compensatory mechanisms although cerebellar activity in patients was not related to target velocity.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2012PLoSO...7E8494N","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Matthias Nagel","Andreas Sprenger","Susanne Steinlechner","Ferdinand Binkofski","Rebekka Lencer"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0038494","first_seen_on":"2012-06-05T21:25:49+00:00","issns":["1932-6203"],"issue":"6","journal":"PLoS ONE","last_mentioned_on":1338932093,"links":["http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038494"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/dx.plos.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0038494.pdf","pmid":"22693639","pubdate":"2012-06-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e38494","subjects":["medicine","science"],"title":"Altered Velocity Processing in Schizophrenia during Pursuit Eye Tracking","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/altered-velocity-processing-schizophrenia-during-pursuit-eye-tracking"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5036908,"mean":5.9657355758162,"rank":2494042,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":47,"this_scored_higher_than":2389900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5036908,"percentile":47},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78532,"mean":5.1273158625256,"rank":33084,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":42803,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78532,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":88911,"mean":9.2651301540885,"rank":45788,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":43,"this_scored_higher_than":38445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":88911,"percentile":43},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2985,"mean":7.349581769437,"rank":1523,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":44,"this_scored_higher_than":1316,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2985,"percentile":44}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
