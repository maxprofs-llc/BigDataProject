These women may seek reproductive health care at medical facilities operated by the military, in the civilian sector, or through the Department of Veterans Affairs. This article reviews the current data on unintended pregnancy and prevalence of and barriers to contraceptive use among active-duty and veteran women. Active-duty servicewomen have high rates of unintended pregnancy and low contraceptive use, which may be due to official prohibition of sexual activity in the military, logistic difficulties faced by deployed women, and limited patient and provider knowledge of available contraceptives. In comparison, little is known about rates of unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use among women veterans. Based on this review, research recommendations to address these issues are provided.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f61000570e","authors":["Schwarz, Eleanor Bimla","Vinita Goyal","Sonya Borrero","Eleanor Bimla Schwarz"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajog.2011.11.018","first_seen_on":"2012-05-31T14:48:37+00:00","issns":["0002-9378","00029378"],"issue":"6","journal":"American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology","last_mentioned_on":1489048209,"links":["http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/PIIS0002937811023489\/abstract?rss=yes","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3361625\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajog.org\/article\/S0002-9378(11)02348-9\/pdf","pmid":"22200252","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"463","subjects":["obstetrics","gynecology"],"title":"Unintended pregnancy and contraception among active-duty servicewomen and veterans","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/linkinghub.elsevier.com\/retrieve\/pii\/S0002937811023489","volume":"206","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/unintended-pregnancy-contraception-among-activeduty-servicewomen-veterans"},"altmetric_score":{"score":14,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":14},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8452553,"mean":7.1043676697798,"rank":627662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":7817058,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8452553,"percentile":92},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":95743,"mean":5.6489746610683,"rank":6753,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":88917,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":95743,"percentile":92},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6080,"mean":8.2930320776444,"rank":650,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":89,"this_scored_higher_than":5417,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6080,"percentile":89},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":70,"mean":6.5795072463768,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":85,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":70,"percentile":85}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
