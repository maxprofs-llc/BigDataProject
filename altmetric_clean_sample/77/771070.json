While there is no definitive treatment for these tumors, several angiogenesis inhibitors, including bleomycin, have been employed. To better understand the mechanism of bleomycin in accelerating haemangioma regression, we investigated the effects of the drug on hemangiomagenesis using a previously described mouse hemangioma model.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60b3cf058f6100069d1","authors":["Mabeta P","Pepper MS"],"doi":"10.1007\/s10456-011-9248-7","first_seen_on":"2012-05-31T19:00:52+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"","journal":"Angiogenesis","last_mentioned_on":1338490841,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22198238?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22198238","pubdate":"2011-12-28T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"Inhibition of hemangioma development in a syngeneic mouse model correlates with bcl-2 suppression and the inhibition of Akt kinase activity.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/inhibition-hemangioma-development-syngeneic-mouse-model-correlates-bcl2-suppression-inhibition-akt-k"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5039474,"mean":5.9644629265799,"rank":4207631,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5039474,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78326,"mean":5.0782266964571,"rank":64596,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78326,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":144,"mean":1.528,"rank":113,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":144,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8,"mean":0.46428571428571,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
