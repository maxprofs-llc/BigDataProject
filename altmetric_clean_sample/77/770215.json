Alcohol and tobacco consumption have been recognized as the main risk factors for development of OSCC. However, 10 to 20% of patients suffering from OSCC have no history of use of these substances. Clinico-pathological evidence suggests that we are dealing with virally-induced cancers, and that HPV should not be a relevant candidate. A systematic search of HPV in OSCC has no real relevance in current clinical practice even although it is still relevant in organized research protocols. Further studies are ongoing, with the aim of identifying other infectious agents, including viruses, in OSCC.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f610000835","authors":["Chlo\u00e9 Bertolus","Chlo\u00e9 Bertolus","Patrick Goudot","Antoine Gessain","Nicolas Berthet"],"doi":"10.1186\/1750-9378-7-13","first_seen_on":"2012-05-31T11:32:05+00:00","issns":["1750-9378"],"issue":"1","journal":"Infectious Agents and Cancer","last_mentioned_on":1338439502,"links":["http:\/\/www.infectagentscancer.com\/content\/7\/1\/13\/abstract"],"pmid":"22647139","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"13","title":"Clinical relevance of systematic human papillomavirus (HPV) diagnosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/clinical-relevance-systematic-human-papillomavirus-hpv-diagnosis-oral-squamous-cell-carcinoma"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3628883,"mean":4.937418267118,"rank":2901690,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":77497,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3628883,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":72994,"mean":4.4639134985546,"rank":53157,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":307,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":72994,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":130,"mean":3.5102790697674,"rank":92,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":130,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":21,"mean":0.6125,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":21,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":2,"Student  > Ph.
