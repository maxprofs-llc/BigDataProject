Hippocampal long-term potentiation represents the major experimental model for the synaptic changes underlying learning and memory and is controlled by endogenous dopamine. We found that hippocampal long-term potentiation is altered in both a neurotoxic and transgenic model of Parkinson's disease and this plastic alteration is associated with an impaired dopaminergic transmission and a decrease of NR2A\/NR2B subunit ratio in synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors. Deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning were also found in hemiparkinsonian and mutant animals. Interestingly, the dopamine precursor l-DOPA was able to restore hippocampal synaptic potentiation via D1\/D5 receptors and to ameliorate the cognitive deficit in parkinsonian animals suggesting that dopamine-dependent impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation may contribute to cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000242e","authors":["Calabresi, Paolo","Costa C","Sgobio C","Siliquini S","Tozzi A","Tantucci M","Ghiglieri V","Di Filippo M","Pendolino V","de Iure A","Marti M","Morari M","Spillantini MG","Latagliata EC","Pascucci T","Puglisi-Allegra S","Gardoni F","Di Luca M","Picconi B","Calabresi P","C.
