Association of template and DC power sources by controllable electrochemistry processes offers a technique platform to efficiently grow a combined heterojunction nanowire arrays driven by a minimization of interfacial energy. The resulting p-n junction materials of CuS\/PbS show highly uniform 1D wire architecture. The single CuS\/PbS p-n heterojunction nanowire based devices were fabricated, and their electrical behaviors were investigated. The independent nanowires exhibited a very high ON\/OFF ratio of 1195, due to the association effect of electrical switches and diodes.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Xuemin Qian","Huibiao Liu","Nan Chen","Haiqing Zhou","Lianfeng Sun","Yongjun Li","Yuliang Li"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300471j","first_seen_on":"2012-06-06T19:22:35+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1339010522,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic300471j"],"pmid":"22671306","pubdate":"2012-06-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120606103920007","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Architecture of CuS\/PbS Heterojunction Semiconductor Nanowire Arrays for Electrical Switches and Diodes","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/architecture-cuspbs-heterojunction-semiconductor-nanowire-arrays-electrical-switches-diodes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506407,"mean":5.1217268660368,"rank":3526254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":134633,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506407,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":76235,"mean":4.8224524752734,"rank":58159,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":601,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":76235,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.592594864955,"rank":5391,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":65,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":314,"mean":1.1341853035144,"rank":276,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":314,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
