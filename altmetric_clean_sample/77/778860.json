Due to their unique biological, physicochemical, and mechanical properties, RNTs could serve as the next generation of injectable orthopedic materials. In this study, a self-assembling module (termed twin base linkers or TBL) was synthesized, and the corresponding RNTs were used as bioactive components in composites of poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles (termed TBL\/HA\/pHEMA). The properties of these composites were characterized for solidification time, surface morphology, mechanical properties, and cytocompatibility. The experimental conditions were optimized to achieve solidification within 2-40 min, offering a range of properties for orthopedic applications. Composites with 20 wt% HA nanoparticles had a compressive strength (37.1 MPa) and an ultimate tensile stress (14.7 MPa) similar to that of a natural vertebral disc (5-30 MPa). Specifically, the TBL (0.01 mg\/mL)\/HA(20 wt%)\/pHEMA composites improved long-term functions of osteoblasts (or bone-forming cells) in terms of collagen synthesis, alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium deposition. Moreover, this composite inhibited fibroblast adhesion, thus decreasing the potential for undesirable fibrous tissue formation. In summary, this in vitro study provided evidence that TBL\/HA\/pHEMA composites are promising injectable orthopedic implant materials that warrant further mechanistic and in vivo studies.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa63a3cf058f610008b9b","authors":["Linlin Sun","Lijie Zhang","Usha D.
