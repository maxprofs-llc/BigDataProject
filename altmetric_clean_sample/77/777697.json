SHA-10 extract, with Immunal, a preparation containing Echinacea purpurea (L.) extract, in uncomplicated common colds was carried out in 130 children aged between 4 and 11 years over a period of 10 days. The study was designed as an adjuvant treatment of Kan Jang and Immunal with a standard treatment. The patients were assigned to one of the three groups. In control group C; 39 patients received only standard treatment. Kan Jang and Immunal were used as an adjuvant to this therapy in the other two groups. Adjuvant group A; 53 patients treated with Kan Jang tablets concomitant to standard treatment, and adjuvant control group B; 41 patients treated with concomitant Immunal. It was found that the adjuvant treatment with Kan Jang, was significantly more effective than Immunal, when started at an early stage of uncomplicated common colds. The symptoms of the disease were less severe in the Kan Jang group. The effect of Kan Jang was particularly pronounced in two objective parameters, amount of nasal secretion g\/day and nasal congestion. Kan Jang also accelerated the recovery time, whereas Immunal did not show the same efficacy. The use of standard medication was significantly less in the Kan Jang adjuvant group than in either the Immunal or standard treatment group. Kan Jang treatment was well tolerated and no side effects or adverse reactions were reported.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005c3a","authors":["Spasov AA","Ostrovskij OV","Chernikov MV","Wikman G"],"doi":"10.1002\/ptr.1359","first_seen_on":"2012-06-05T14:11:38+00:00","issns":["0951-418X"],"issue":"1","journal":"Phytotherapy Research","last_mentioned_on":1338905485,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/14750201","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/14750201\/"],"pmid":"14750201","pubdate":"2004-01-31T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Comparative controlled study of Andrographis paniculata fixed combination, Kan Jang and an Echinacea preparation as adjuvant, in the treatment of uncomplicated respiratory disease in children.","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/comparative-controlled-study-andrographis-paniculata-fixed-combination-kan-jang-echinacea-preparatio"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7657399,"mean":6.5796747534814,"rank":3963214,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":2150636,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7657399,"percentile":28},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93396,"mean":5.3673552117351,"rank":44344,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"this_scored_higher_than":36654,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93396,"percentile":39},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1292,"mean":5.6045917893106,"rank":691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":36,"this_scored_higher_than":472,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1292,"percentile":36},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.5461538461538,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":42,"this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":42}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Ph.
