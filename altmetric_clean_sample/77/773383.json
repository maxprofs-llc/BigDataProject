However, there are a few recant reports on non-viral vector-mediated p53 gene delivery in breast cancer. Methods\u2002 A new formulation of luminescent silica nanoparticles (LSNs) for gene delivery was produced by the two-step method with slight modification. Key findings\u2002 The pp53 plasmid constructs (p53-EGFP)\/LSNs complexes were transfected into human breast cancer cell (MCF-7) and transfection efficiency was determined by FACS analysis. The gene expression was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis respectively. Further the growth inhibition through induced apoptosis with pp53-EGFP\/LSNs complex were assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and annexin V staining, respectively. Interestingly the in vivo biodistribution of plasmid DNA study revealed the occurrence was investigated by PCR and RT-PCR. The transfection efficiency of LSNs showed the highest transfection efficiency among the LSN formulation was higher than that of commercially available Lipofectin\u00ae. The LSNs-mediated transfection of the p53 gene resulted in efficient high level of wild-type p53 mRNA and protein expression levels in MCF-7 cells. Selected tissues were analyzed for any potential toxicity by histological analysis the efficient reestablishment of wild-type p53 function in breast cancer cells restored the p53 dependent apoptotic pathway. Conclusions\u2002 Taken together, our results reveal that cationic LSN-mediated p53 gene delivery may have potential application as a non-viral vector-mediated breast cancer gene therapy due to its effective induction of apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002eb9","authors":["Rejeeth, Chandrababu","Salem, Ahmed"],"doi":"10.1111\/j.2042-7158.2012.01547.x","endpage":"315","first_seen_on":"2012-06-01T22:19:20+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2042-7158"],"issue":"3","journal":"Journal of Pharmacy & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1460975411,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.2042-7158.2012.01547.x\/full","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27085860?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.2042-7158.2012.01547.x\/pdf","pmid":"27085860","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"startpage":"305","subjects":["pharmacy","pharmacology"],"title":"Novel luminescent silica nanoparticles (LSN): p53 gene delivery system in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-luminescent-silica-nanoparticles-lsn-p53-gene-delivery-system-breast-cancer-vitro-vivo-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7565447,"mean":6.5306080289211,"rank":3061492,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":4456238,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7565447,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92832,"mean":5.299711992761,"rank":30872,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":61264,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92832,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":682,"mean":2.6411512481645,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":345,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":682,"percentile":50},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3,"mean":6.25,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Researcher":1,"Unspecified":2},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1,"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1,"Unspecified":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/722008309641773056","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[773383],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T10:26:09+00:00","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed.","id_on_source":"CancerPapers","tweeter_id":"3326766226","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":727},"tweet_id":"722008309641773056"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genomeguardian\/statuses\/722009322402648064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[773383],"posted_on":"2016-04-18T10:30:11+00:00","author":{"name":"TP53","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/516935062370000897\/PnU7aavz_normal.jpeg","description":"A twitterbot dedicated to supplying the most recent papers about p53, the Guardian of the Genome.","id_on_source":"genomeguardian","tweeter_id":"2794540623","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":175},"tweet_id":"722009322402648064"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/genes5\/statuses\/208684131943583745","license":"datasift","citation_ids":[773383],"posted_on":"2012-06-01T22:19:08+00:00","author":{"name":"genes","url":"http:\/\/www.whatisimmunity.com","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_5_normal.png","description":"myself priti very much interested in sharing knowledge and work in various fields such as health care,diet,supplements,toxicity and many more","id_on_source":"genes5","tweeter_id":"296359530","followers":42},"tweet_id":"208684131943583745"}]}}
