The compounds 1 and 2 are characterized by HR-MS mass, (1)H, and (13)C NMR, FTIR, UV-vis, and electrochemical techniques and the structures are determined by X-ray single crystal analysis. The X-ray analysis revealed different coordination behavior of Re(CO)(3) with 21-thiaporphyrin and 21-oxaporphyrin. Interestingly, the Re(CO)(3) coordinates to two of the three inner nitrogens and one sulfur instead of three inner nitrogens as generally expected to produce unique compound 1 whereas it coordinates to three inner nitrogens but not with furan oxygen to form compound 2. The 21-thiaporphyrin ring is more distorted in compound 1 compared to 21-oxaporphyrin ring in compound 2 on complexation with Re(CO)(3). The presence of three carbonyl groups in compounds 1 and 2 are verified by (13)C NMR and IR spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of compounds 1 and 2 showed ill-defined Q-bands along with broad Soret band and the extinction coefficients are much lower than their corresponding free base porphyrins. The compounds 1 and 2 showed two reversible porphyrin ring based reductions supporting their electron deficient nature. The compound 1 is very stable under protonation conditions, and the protonation occurs at the uncoordinated pyrrole ring whereas the compound 2 undergoes decomplexation under same conditions. Furthermore, compound 1 showed the fluxional behavior in coordination mode of binding in solution.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002ae4","authors":["Avijit Ghosh","Mangalampalli Ravikanth"],"doi":"10.1021\/ic300344g","first_seen_on":"2012-06-01T19:41:18+00:00","issns":["0020-1669","1520-510X"],"journal":"Inorganic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1338579662,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/abs\/10.1021\/ic300344g"],"pmid":"22651690","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Inorganic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"120601082935002","subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes of 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl-21-thia and 21-Oxaporphyrins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rheniumi-tricarbonyl-complexes-5101520tetraphenyl21thia-21oxaporphyrins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4506935,"mean":5.125739366827,"rank":3533842,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":135112,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4506935,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":75981,"mean":4.7831363516715,"rank":58846,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":612,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":75981,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5999,"mean":1.5652857619206,"rank":5219,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":66,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5999,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":322,"mean":1.0277258566978,"rank":248,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":322,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"researcher":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.
