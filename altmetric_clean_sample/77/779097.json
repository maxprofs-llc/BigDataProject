Their capacity to dodge the induction of macrophages microbicidal functions was found to correlate with the alteration of several signalling pathways regulating those latter. In this review, the role of the Leishmania GP63 as a critical virulence factor influencing macrophage physiology will be discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5043cf058f6100030c1","authors":["Martin Olivier","Vanessa Diniz Atayde","Amandine Isnard","Kasra Hassani","Marina Tiemi Shio"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.micinf.2012.05.014","first_seen_on":"2012-06-06T10:42:40+00:00","funders":["cihr"],"issns":["1286-4579","12864579"],"journal":"Microbes & Infection","last_mentioned_on":1375285680,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S128645791200144X","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22683718","http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S128645791200144X?v=s5"],"pmid":"22683718","pubdate":"2012-06-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier Masson SAS","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["microbiology","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Leishmania virulence factors: focus on the metalloprotease GP63 ","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/leishmania-virulence-factors-focus-metalloprotease-gp63"},"altmetric_score":{"score":13.35,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":13.35},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4724864,"mean":5.6963290495431,"rank":321015,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":4402960,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4724864,"percentile":93},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77054,"mean":5.0869351485341,"rank":5233,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":93,"this_scored_higher_than":71801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77054,"percentile":93},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":776,"mean":6.0821419354839,"rank":68,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":708,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":776,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":41,"mean":1.6625,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":97,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":41,"percentile":97}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":7,"Researcher":19,"Student  > Ph.
