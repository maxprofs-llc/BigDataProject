The neurohormone oxytocin (OXT), mediated through its specific receptor (OXTR), is involved in the regulation of social behaviour and social cognition. Previous research has suggested a role of OXT system genes in disorders of social reciprocity. Preliminary evidence points to an association of peripheral OXT levels as well as OXT and OXTR gene polymorphisms with psychotic symptoms and treatment response in schizophrenia. This study aims to determine a possible contribution of OXT and OXTR genetic variations to schizophrenia susceptibility.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f61000472c","authors":["Christiane Montag","Eva-Maria Brockmann","Martin Bayerl","Dan Rujescu","Daniel J.
