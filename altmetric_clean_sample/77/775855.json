It is estimated that more than 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection and more than 100 countries have endemic dengue virus transmission. Laboratory tests are essential to provide an accurate diagnosis of dengue virus infection so that appropriate treatment and patient management may be administered. In many dengue endemic settings, laboratory diagnostic resources are limited and simple rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide opportunities for point-of-care diagnosis. This paper addresses current issues relating to the application of commercial dengue RDTs for the diagnosis of acute dengue virus infection, recent diagnostic evaluations, and identifies future needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ef3cf058f610002cd1","authors":["Blacksell, Stuart D."],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/151967","first_seen_on":"2012-06-04T13:49:12+00:00","funders":["wellcome"],"handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1110-7243","1110-7251"],"journal":"Journal of Biomedicine & Biotechnology","last_mentioned_on":1425495512,"links":["http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2012\/151967\/","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3357944\/","http:\/\/www.hindawi.com\/journals\/bmri\/2012\/151967\/"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/jbb\/2012\/151967.pdf","pmcid":"PMC3357944","pmid":"22654479","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["medicine","biotechnology"],"title":"Commercial Dengue Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Point-of-Care Application: Recent Evaluations and Future Needs?","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/commercial-dengue-rapid-diagnostic-tests-pointofcare-application-recent-evaluations-future-needs"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7772166,"mean":6.6362066801147,"rank":1465122,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":6279101,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7772166,"percentile":80},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":93759,"mean":5.3772882740673,"rank":16673,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":76720,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":93759,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":374,"mean":5.5368793565684,"rank":62,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":308,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":374,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7,"mean":4.2723333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7,"percentile":57}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":32,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.
