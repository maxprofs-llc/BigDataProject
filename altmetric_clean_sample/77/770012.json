Do bimanual movements require information processing in the same set of brain areas that are engaged by movements of the individual components (left and right hands)? Or is it necessary that other brain areas are recruited to help in the act of coordination? These two possibilities are often considered as mutually exclusive, with studies yielding support for one or the other depending on techniques and hypotheses. However, as yet there is no account of how the two views may work together dynamically. Using the method of Mode-Level Cognitive Subtraction (MLCS) on high density EEG recorded during unimanual and bimanual movements, we expose spatiotemporal reorganization of large-scale cortical networks during stable inphase and antiphase coordination and transitions between them. During execution of stable bimanual coordination patterns, neural dynamics were dominated by temporal modulation of unimanual networks. At instability and transition, there was evidence for recruitment of additional areas. Our study provides a framework to quantify large-scale network mechanisms underlying complex cognitive tasks often studied with macroscopic neurophysiological recordings.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50c3cf058f610003196","authors":["Arpan Banerjee","Emmanuelle Tognoli","J.A.
