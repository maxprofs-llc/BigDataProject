In model organisms and cell lines, large-scale screens have identified key components of many cellular pathways and helped to identify novel targets in disease-relevant pathways. Image-based high-content screening has become an increasingly important tool in high-throughput screening, enabling changes in phenotype characteristics, such as cell morphology and cell differentiation, to be monitored. In this review, we discuss the use of image-based screening approaches to explore the behavior of adult, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells. First, we review how current pluripotency and differentiation assays can be adapted to high-throughput formats. We then describe general aspects of image-based screening of cells and present an outlook on challenges for screening stem cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60e3cf058f610006ca7","authors":["Erdmann, Gerrit","Volz, Christian","Boutros, Michael","Gerrit Erdmann","Christian Volz","Michael Boutros"],"doi":"10.1002\/biot.201200117","endpage":"778","first_seen_on":"2012-06-06T14:04:55+00:00","issns":["1860-7314","1860-6768","18606768"],"issue":"6","journal":"Biotechnology Journal","last_mentioned_on":1338990889,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biot.201200117\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/biot.201200117\/pdf","pmid":"22653826","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"WILEY\u00e2\u0080\u0090VCH Verlag","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"768","subjects":["biotechnology"],"title":"Systematic approaches to dissect biological processes in stem cells by image\u00e2\u0080\u0090based screening","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/biot.201200117","volume":"7","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/systematic-approaches-dissect-biological-processes-stem-cells-imagebased-screening"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7420052,"mean":6.4521287710784,"rank":5614385,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":995481,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7420052,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92681,"mean":5.318149827363,"rank":60262,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":16774,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92681,"percentile":18},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":768,"mean":6.9937262059974,"rank":655,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":43,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":768,"percentile":5},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":4.41,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
