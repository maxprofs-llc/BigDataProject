However, higher tendency of dye-leaching by water and lower wettability of dye molecules are two major obstacles need to be tackled for future applications of aqueous DSSCs. Sensitizers designed for aqueous DSSCs are discussed based on their functions, such as modification of the molecular skeleton and the anchoring group for better stability against dye-leaching by water, and incorporation of hydrophilic entity in the dye molecule or addition of surfactant to the system to increase wettability of the dye for more facile dye regeneration. Surface treatment of the photoanode for deterring dye-leaching or improving wettability of the dye molecule is also discussed. Redox mediators designed for aqueous DSSCs are also discussed. The review also includes quantum dot sensitized solar cells, which focus on improvement of QD loading and suppression of interfacial charge recombination at the photoanode.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e58","authors":["Li, Chun\u2010Ting","Lin, Ryan Yeh\u2010Yung","Lin, Jiann T."],"doi":"10.1002\/asia.201601627","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T20:39:40+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["18614728","1861-471X"],"journal":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","last_mentioned_on":1486328462,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601627\/abstract;jsessionid=2D1C54F2B3E24B09CE9B6A1249AF28C9.f01t02","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601627\/abstract;jsessionid=708282887A2BA4724D904BFE2B0D8477.f01t04","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/asia.201601627?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/asia.201601627\/pdf","pmid":"28070969","pubdate":"2017-02-03T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"title":"Sensitizers for aqueous-based solar cells","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/doi.wiley.com\/10.1002\/asia.201601627","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sensitizers-aqueousbased-solar-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8166192,"mean":6.9129712202356,"rank":4327783,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2267239,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8166192,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":263462,"mean":12.837205301733,"rank":150266,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":33,"this_scored_higher_than":87046,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":263462,"percentile":33},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2501,"mean":1.3721424,"rank":447,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":74,"this_scored_higher_than":1873,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2501,"percentile":74},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":112,"mean":1.5189189189189,"rank":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":72,"this_scored_higher_than":81,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":112,"percentile":72}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
