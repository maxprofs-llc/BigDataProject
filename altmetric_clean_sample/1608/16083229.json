The work presented here assesses the role of the signaling molecule protein kinase C theta (PKC\u03b8) in the induction of IL-10 expression in CD4+ T cells. Using wildtype and PKC\u03b8-deficient Tg4 T cell receptor transgenic mice, we implemented a well-described protocol of repeated doses of myelin basic protein (MBP)Ac1-9[4Y] antigen to induce Tr1-like IL-10+ T cells. We find that PKC\u03b8 is required for the efficient induction of IL-10 following antigen administration. Both serum concentrations of IL-10 and the proportion of IL-10+ T cells were reduced in PKC\u03b8-deficient mice relative to wildtype mice following [4Y] treatment. We further characterized the T cells of [4Y] treated PKC\u03b8-deficient Tg4 mice and found reduced expression of the transcription factors cMaf, Nfil3 and FoxP3 and the surface receptors PD-1 and Tim3, all of which have been associated with the differentiation or function of IL-10+ T cells. Finally, we demonstrated that, unlike [4Y] treated wildtype Tg4 T cells, cells from PKC\u03b8-deficient mice were unable to suppress the priming of na\u00efve T cells in vitro and in vivo. In summary, we present data demonstrating a role for PKC\u03b8 in the induction of suppressive, IL-10-secreting T cells induced in TCR-transgenic mice following chronic antigen administration. This should be considered when contemplating PKC\u03b8 as a suitable drug target for inducing immune suppression and graft tolerance.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","authors":["Graham J.
