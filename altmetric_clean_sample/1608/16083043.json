The synthetic sample was found to be of S-configuration by VCD spectroscopy and comparison of the data with DFT calculations, while ECD spectroscopy was found to be inconclusive in this case. The enantiomeric purity of samples from test purchases and police seizures was assessed by a self-developed chiral HPLC method.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007df","authors":["Carina Weber","Stefan Pusch","Dieter Schollmeyer","Sascha M\u00fcnster-M\u00fcller","Michael P\u00fctz","Till Opatz"],"doi":"10.3762\/bjoc.12.279","first_seen_on":"2017-02-03T18:53:52+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1860-5397"],"journal":"Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1486147685,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5238538\/"],"pmid":"28144353","pubdate":"2017-02-03T20:16:00+00:00","publisher":"Beilstein-Institut","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"startpage":"2808","title":"Characterization of the synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-CHMCZCA","type":"article","volume":"12","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/characterization-synthetic-cannabinoid-abchminaca"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0.5,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8155605,"mean":6.9067370031636,"rank":6193967,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1096847,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8155605,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":262823,"mean":12.839419546308,"rank":190123,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":44905,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":262823,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":285,"mean":2.4995,"rank":190,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":60,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":285,"percentile":21},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":23,"mean":1.5204545454545,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":23,"percentile":17}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Chemistry":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/GacetaCienForen\/statuses\/827589493301661700","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[16083043],"posted_on":"2017-02-03T18:48:05+00:00","author":{"name":"Gac Ciencia Forense","url":"http:\/\/www.uv.es\/gicf\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566123006179545089\/yXGddJpq_normal.jpeg","description":"Gaceta Internacional de Ciencias Forenses \/ International Gazette of Forensic Sciences.
