Our aim was to shed light on the mechanistic basis of thermoperiodic floral induction with acceleration under lower DT than NT compared to other DT-NT-combinations at the same average daily temperature (ADT), a response exploited in temperate area greenhouses. Arabidopsis thaliana floral pathway mutants and a lhy circadian clock mutant as well as the expression of floral integrators and LHY were studied under different DT-NT-combinations, all at the same ADT. We show that acceleration of floral induction under lower DT than NT is linked to increased FT expression early during the day and generally increased LFY expression preceding visible flower buds, compared to higher DT than NT or equal DT and NT. Consistent with FT-action through LFY, time to floral transition in ft-1 and lfy-1 was similar under\u00a0all treatments, in contrast to the situation for soc1-1, which behaved wild type- (WT) like. The lhy-21 mutants did not discriminate between opposite DT-NT-combinations, whereas LHY expression in the WT differed in these temperature regimes. This might suggest that LHY play a role in thermoperiodic control of floral induction. We conclude that thermoperiodic control of floral transition is associated with modulation of the diurnal expression patterns of FT with timing of temperature alteration being important rather than ADT.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f610003330","authors":["Micael Wendell","Linda Ripel","YeonKyeong Lee","Odd Arne Rognli","Sissel Torre","Jorunn E.
