A male patient showed severe developmental delay, pendular nystagmus and laryngeal wheezing. The auditory brain stem response showed only the first wave and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter hypomyelination, suggesting typical PMD. A novel PLP1 mutation, F240L, which was inherited from his mother, was identified.","altmetric_jid":"55f17ebf2a83ee43768b4590","authors":["Yongping Lu","Keiko Shimojima","Tomoko Sakuma","Sachiko Nakaoka","Toshiyuki Yamamoto"],"doi":"10.1038\/hgv.2016.44","first_seen_on":"2017-01-05T08:02:42+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2054-345X"],"journal":"Human Genome Variation","last_mentioned_on":1483603349,"links":["http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/hgv201644?WT.feed_name=subjects_medical-research"],"pmid":"28101371","pubdate":"2017-01-05T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Mutation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Genetics research","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"16044","title":"A novel PLP1 mutation F240L identified in a patient with connatal type Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease","type":"article","volume":"4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7987814,"mean":6.7359164730015,"rank":6910358,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7987814,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253770,"mean":12.60118376161,"rank":209080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253770,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":57,"mean":3.6224642857143,"rank":48,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":57,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":0.625,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/kellysheridan22\/statuses\/816917774295592960","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[15241470],"posted_on":"2017-01-05T08:02:29+00:00","author":{"name":"Andeee Ferrel","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/812401673817702404\/TGJQp1XV_normal.jpg","description":"Hi there!   like biology, food, and fast cars (just kidding).
