Two related patients had a heterozygous, likely pathogenic novel variant of POLD1 (NM002691.3: c.3199 G>A; p.E1067K). Most patients had high ratios (>1.5) of %fat trunk to %fat legs (FMR) when compared to reference normals. Liver fat quantified using MR Dixon method was high (11.3+6.3%) and correlated positively with hemoglobin A1c and triglycerides while leg fat by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) correlated negatively with triglycerides. In addition to known metabolic comorbidities; chronic pain (78.3%), hypertension (56.5%) and mood disorders (52.2%) were highly prevalent. Mean NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) score was 5\u00b11 and 78.3% had fibrosis. LMNA-immunofluorescence staining from select patients (including one with the novel POLD1 variant) showed a high degree of nuclear atypia and disorganization.\nPL is a complex multi-system disorder. Metabolic parameters correlate negatively with extremity fat and positively with liver fat. DEXA-based FMR may prove useful as a diagnostic tool. Nuclear disorganization and atypia may be a common biomarker even in the absence of pathogenic variants in LMNA. This article is protected by copyright.
