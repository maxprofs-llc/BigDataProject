This knowledge is prerequisite for a better understanding of seminal plasma variability, which is linked to semen quality. The objective of this study was to characterize the proteomes of seminal vesicle fluid and seminal plasma and to compare them to better understand the origin of seminal plasma proteins. We collected ejaculates and seminal vesicle fluid postmortem from 6 mature Holstein Friesian bulls. We performed the analysis and identification of proteins using 2-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization mass spectrometry. We identified 105 proteins in bull seminal vesicle fluid and 88 proteins in seminal plasma. For both seminal vesicles and seminal plasma proteins described in our study, top biological functions were cellular movement, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Additionally, seminal vesicle fluid proteins were involved in protein degradation and synthesis. Seminal plasma proteins were also involved in cellular assembly and organization and cell-to-cell signaling and interactions. Proteins of both fluids were involved in the following canonical pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, liver X receptor\/farnesoid X receptor, and farnesoid X receptor\/retinoid X receptor activation. Additionally, seminal vesicle fluid proteins appeared to be involved in oxidative stress response mediated by nuclear factor E2-related factor 2. Our results described the bull seminal vesicle fluid proteome for the first time and allowed for significant expansion of the current knowledge on the bull seminal plasma proteome. Moreover, analysis indicated that both bull seminal vesicle fluid and seminal plasma proteomes contained interconnected protein groups related to protective functions, glycolysis, and the morphology and physiology of the spermatozoa. These proteins and their interactions could be targeted in future research.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002d4a","authors":["B. Westfalewicz","M.A. Dietrich","A. Mostek","A. Partyka","W.
