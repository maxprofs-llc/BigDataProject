Participants (N=336) ages 18-27 years old were evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID). The SCAARED was completed at or within two-weeks before the SCID. The psychometrics of the SCAARED were analyzed using standard statistical analyses including principal components, and Receiver Operant Curve analyses. A replication was performed in an age\/sex matched independent sample (N=158).\nThe SCAARED showed four factors: somatic\/panic\/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and social anxiety. The total and each factor scores demonstrated good internal consistency (\u03b1=0.86-0.97) and good discriminant validity between anxiety and other disorders and within anxiety disorders for generalized and social anxiety. Area Under the Curve for the total and each of the factor scores ranged between 0.72 and 0.84 (p<0.0001). These results were replicated in the independent sample.\nThe SCAARED showed excellent psychometric properties supporting its use to screen adults for anxiety disorders, longitudinal studies following youth into adulthood and studies comparing child and adult populations. Further replication studies in larger community and clinical samples are indicated.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033d2","authors":["Angulo, Melina","Rooks, Brian T.","Gill, MaryKay","Goldstein, Tina","Sakolsky, Dara","Goldstein, Benjamin","Monk, Kelly","Hickey, Mary Beth","Diler, Rasim S.","Hafeman, Danella","Merranko, John","Axelson, David","Birmaher, Boris","Melina Angulo","Brian T.
