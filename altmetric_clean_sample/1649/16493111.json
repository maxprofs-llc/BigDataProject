Data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were employed (N\u00a0=\u00a06,611; 20-85\u00a0yrs), with follow-up mortality assessment through 31 December 2006. DNA was extracted from whole blood to assess LTL via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared to those in the first LTL tertile, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for those in the 2(nd) and 3(rd) LTL tertiles, respectively, was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.60-1.12; P\u00a0=\u00a0.22) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.50-1.14; P\u00a0=\u00a0.18). However, after adjustments, LTL tertile 3 (vs. 1) was associated with all-cause mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.37; 95% CI: 0.14-0.93; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) for those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise. Similarly, LTL was associated with CVD-specific mortality for those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.17; 95% CI: 0.04-0.73; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). Longer telomeres are associated with increased survival, particularly among men and those who are active, underscoring the importance of promotion of physical activity behaviour.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f61000150d","authors":["Loprinzi, Paul D.","Loenneke, Jeremy P.","Paul D.
