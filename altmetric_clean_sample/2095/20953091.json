However, the mechanism of this effect is still unclear. This study investigated the antioxidant effect of NaBu on HepG2 cells under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. NaBu (0.3\u00a0mM) attenuated cell death and accumulation of reactive oxygen species and improved multiple antioxidant parameters in H2O2-injured HepG2 cells. NaBu inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) by increasing the p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9) level and promoted nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which increased the expression of downstream antioxidant enzymes. Together with promotion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha and mitochondrial DNA copy number, NaBu modulated energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, decreasing glycolysis, increasing \u03b2-oxidation, and enhancing the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. NaBu increased mitochondrial manganese-superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. In conclusion, NaBu protected HepG2 cells against oxidative stress by modulating Nrf2 pathway activity and mitochondrial function.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6293cf058f610007df3","authors":["Xing, Xingan","Jiang, Zheshu","Tang, Xue","Wang, Panpan","Li, Yingrui","Sun, Yongjuan","Le, Guowei","Zou, Sixiang"],"doi":"10.1007\/s13105-017-0568-y","first_seen_on":"2017-06-11T10:31:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1138-7548","1877-8755"],"journal":"Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1497177076,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28600747?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28600747","pubdate":"2017-06-11T22:01:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["physiology","biochemistry"],"title":"Sodium butyrate protects against oxidative stress in HepG2 cells through modulating Nrf2 pathway and mitochondrial function","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sodium-butyrate-protects-against-oxidative-stress-hepg2-cells-through-modulating-nrf2-pathway-mitoch"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8352366,"mean":7.0446264010179,"rank":7220337,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8352366,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":242301,"mean":12.586092018159,"rank":197796,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":242301,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":206,"mean":3.1217365853659,"rank":148,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":206,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":8.9725,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
