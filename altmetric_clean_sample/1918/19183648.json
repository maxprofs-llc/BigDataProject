The synthesis of PEGs of different molecular weights (ranging from 2000 to 13 000 g mol(-1) with polydispersities <1.15) with a central ketal unit (PEG-ketal-diol) and their conversion to PEG-ketal-dimethacrylates (PEG-ketal-DMA) is introduced. Degradation rates of both PEG-ketal-diols and PEG-ketal-DMA are investigated by in situ (1) H NMR kinetic studies in deuterated phosphate buffer. Hydrogels containing 0, 5, or 10 wt% of PEG-ketal-DMA and 100, 95, or 90 wt% of PEG-DMA, respectively, are synthesized and disintegration of the gels is investigated in buffer at different pH values. Visible disintegration of the gels appears at pH 5 for hydrogels containing PEG-ketal-DMA, whereas no visible degradation is observed at all at neutral pH or for PEG hydrogels without PEG-ketal-DMA.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f610008093","authors":["Pohlit, Hannah","Leibig, Daniel","Frey, Holger"],"doi":"10.1002\/mabi.201600532","first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T16:58:54+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["16165187","1616-5195"],"journal":"Macromolecular Bioscience","last_mentioned_on":1492599649,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201600532\/abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/mabi.201600532\/pdf","pmid":"28337839","pubdate":"2017-03-24T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Macromolecular And Materials Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Materials Science","Chemical Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Dimethacrylates with Cleavable Ketal Sites: Precursors for Cleavable PEG-Hydrogels","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/polyethylene-glycol-dimethacrylates-cleavable-ketal-sites-precursors-cleavable-peghydrogels"},"altmetric_score":{"score":7,"score_history":{"1y":7,"6m":7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":1153642,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":84,"this_scored_higher_than":6856359,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":84},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232953,"mean":12.773757855695,"rank":48837,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":181806,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232953,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":923,"mean":2.1976854663774,"rank":105,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":763,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":923,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.8,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":92,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":92}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Ph.
