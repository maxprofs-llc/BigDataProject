The investigation protocol included SSR, sensory and motor NCS and EMG. SSR was performed not only in FD patients, but also in 18 normal controls. All FD patients had normal nerve conduction studies and electromyography. SSR was present in all controls with a mean amplitude of 1453.6+\/-682.3 microV. However, the SSR was absent in six and lower than 500 microV in the remaining FD patients. All patients had normal sensory and motor NCS and EMG. SSR, on the other hand, was significantly altered in all patients and this test could, therefore, be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of FD patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f6e","authors":["Gomes, Irenio","Nora, Daniel B","Becker, Jefferson","Ehlers, Jo\u00e3o Arthur C","Schwartz, Ida V D","Giugliani, Roberto","Ashton-Prolla, Patricia","Jardim, Laura"],"first_seen_on":"2017-04-19T16:54:57+00:00","issns":["0022-510X"],"issue":"1-2","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","last_mentioned_on":1492642043,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12972384"],"pmid":"12972384","pubdate":"2003-10-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Nerve conduction studies, electromyography and sympathetic skin response in Fabry's disease.","type":"article","volume":"214","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nerve-conduction-studies-electromyography-sympathetic-skin-response-fabrys-disease-2"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.7,"score_history":{"1y":2.7,"6m":2.7,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8083930,"mean":6.8667526310456,"rank":3213602,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":4844626,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8083930,"percentile":59},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":232956,"mean":12.773492906355,"rank":84102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":63,"this_scored_higher_than":147732,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":232956,"percentile":63},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2138,"mean":4.4663743565746,"rank":792,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":1339,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2138,"percentile":62},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":83,"mean":4.5134146341463,"rank":30,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":52,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":83,"percentile":62}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
