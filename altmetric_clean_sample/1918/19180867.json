Rev. Lett. 118, 167204 (2017) - Environmentally Mediated Coherent Control of a Spin Qubit in Diamond","Controlling diamond NV spins via spins in their environment"],"citation":{"abstract":"The coherent control of spin qubits forms the basis of many applications in quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy. Such control is conventionally achieved by direct driving of the qubit transition with a resonant global field, typically at microwave frequencies. Here we introduce an approach that relies on the resonant driving of nearby environment spins, whose localized magnetic field in turn drives the qubit when the environmental spin Rabi frequency matches the qubit resonance. This concept of environmentally mediated resonance (EMR) is explored experimentally using a qubit based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, with nearby electronic spins serving as the environmental mediators. We demonstrate EMR driven coherent control of the NV spin state, including the observation of Rabi oscillations, free induction decay, and spin echo. This technique also provides a way to probe the nanoscale environment of spin qubits, which we illustrate by acquisition of electron spin resonance spectra from single NV centers in various settings.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6343cf058f610008519","authors":["Scott E.
