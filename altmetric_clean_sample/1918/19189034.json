Here we report a new approach to studying human vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) pathophysiology by examining VSMCs differentiated from progenitors found in skin. Approach and Results: Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) were cultured from biopsies (N=164, ~1 cm(2)) taken from the edges of surgical incisions of older adults (N=158; males 72%; mean age 62.7\u00b113 years) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, and differentiated into VSMCs at high efficiency (>80% yield).\u00a0 The number of SKPs isolated from subjects with T2D were ~50% lower than those without T2D (cells\/g: 0.18\u00b10.03, N=58 vs. 0.40\u00b10.05, N=100, P<0.05). \u00a0Importantly, SKP-derived VSMCs from subjects with T2D had higher Fluo-5F-determined baseline cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations (AU: 1,968\u00b1160, N=7, vs. 1,386\u00b1170, N=13, P<0.05), and a trend towards greater Ca(2+) cycling responses to norepinephrine (AUC: 177,207\u00b124,669, N=7 vs. 101,537\u00b115,881, N=20, P<0.08) despite a reduced frequency of Ca(2+) cycling (events s(-1) cell(-1): 0.011\u00b10.004, N=8 vs. 0.021\u00b10.003, N=19, P<0.05) than those without T2D. \u00a0SKP-derived VSMCs from subjects with T2D also manifest enhanced sensitivity to phenylephrine in an impedance-based assay (EC50 nM: 72.3\u00b163.6, N=5 vs. 3,684\u00b13,122, N=9, P<0.05), and impaired wound closure in vitro (% closure: 21.9\u00b13.6, N=4 vs. 67.0\u00b110.3, N=4, P<0.05).\u00a0 Compared to aortic- and saphenous vein-derived primary VSMCs, SKP-derived VSMCs are functionally distinct, but mirror defects of T2D also exhibited by primary VSMCs.\u00a0 Conclusion: Skin biopsies from older adults yield sufficient SKPs to differentiate VSMCs, which reveal abnormal phenotypes of T2D that survive differentiation and persist even after long-term normoglycemic culture.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f61000257b","authors":["Sarah Katherina Steinbach","Terrence M Yau","Maral Ouzounian","Husam Abdel-Qadir","Mark
