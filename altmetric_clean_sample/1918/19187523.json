Twelve amidines were synthesized and their DNA binding, fluorescence properties, in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo activities were evaluated. These compounds are shown to bind in the DNA minor groove with high affinity, and exhibit superior in\u00a0vitro antitrypanosomal activity to that of DAPI. Six new diamidines (5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f and 5j) exhibit superior in\u00a0vivo activity to that of DAPI and four of these compounds provide 100% animal cure at a low dose of 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0mg\/kg i.p. in T.\u00a0b. rhodesiense infected mice. Generally, the fluorescence properties of the new analogues are inferior to that of DAPI with the exception of compound 5i which shows a moderate increase in efficacy while compound 5k is comparable to DAPI.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000283d","authors":["Abdelbasset A.
