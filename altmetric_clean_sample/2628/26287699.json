The six of 50 patients who stayed free from nausea practiced self-care more frequent (m=25.8days) than the 44 patients experiencing nausea (m=14.5) (p=0.013). The CAM self-care strategies were: modifying eating (80% of all self-care practicing patients, 80% of the nauseous patients versus 83% of the patients free from nausea; ns) or drinking habits (38%, 41% vs 17%; ns), taking rests (18%, 20% vs 0%; ns), physical exercising (6%, 2% vs 33%; p=0.035), acupressure (4%, 5% vs 0%; ns) and self-induced vomiting (2%, 2% vs 0%; ns).\nA fourth of patients undergoing emetogenic radiotherapy practiced CAM self-care for nausea, mostly by modifying eating or drinking habits. The CAM self-care practicing patients who did not become nauseous practiced self-care more frequent than the nauseous patients did. To make such self-care evidence based, we need studies evaluating its efficacy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000582a","authors":["Anna Enblom","Gunnar Steineck","Sussanne B\u00f6rjeson"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ctim.2017.08.003","first_seen_on":"2017-09-19T00:17:21+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["09652299","1873-6963"],"journal":"Complementary Therapies in Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1506617155,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28917366?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"28917366","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Nursing","Health Professions"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies"],"title":"Complementary and alternative medicine self-care strategies for nausea in patients undergoing abdominal or pelvic irradiation for cancer: A longitudinal observational study of implementation in routine care","type":"article","volume":"34"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":1,"6d":1,"5d":1,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8462498,"mean":7.1083922572655,"rank":4275352,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3968381,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8462498,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":126064,"mean":11.782621530505,"rank":61014,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":59124,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":126064,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":669,"mean":7.5843892215569,"rank":438,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":200,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":669,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11,"mean":1.835,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11,"percentile":45}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":2}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MBHolistic\/statuses\/909934347104411648","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26287699],"posted_on":"2017-09-19T00:17:08+00:00","author":{"name":"Monterey Holistic","url":"http:\/\/www.montereybayholistic.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793206537254686724\/_c1aiyQP_normal.jpg","description":"501(c)3 #health #education #exercise #healthnews #nutrition #holistic #fitness #wellness #inspirational #healing #success #quotes #yoga #chiropractic #fitness","id_on_source":"MBHolistic","tweeter_id":"28173797","geo":{"lt":37.25022,"ln":-119.75126,"country":"US"},"followers":28292},"tweet_id":"909934347104411648"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/beccaajacksonn\/statuses\/913444670876930048","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26287699],"posted_on":"2017-09-28T16:45:55+00:00","author":{"name":"becca","url":"http:\/\/Instagram.com\/becca.jackson\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/907294064017641472\/qYlYDGUW_normal.jpg","description":"uh huh honey","id_on_source":"beccaajacksonn","tweeter_id":"720403352442572800","geo":{"lt":43.00035,"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US"},"followers":65},"tweet_id":"913444670876930048"}]}}
