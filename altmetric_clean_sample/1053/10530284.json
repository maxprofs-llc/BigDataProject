However, the mechanism by which convulsive SE results in neurodegeneration is not fully understood. It has been shown that epileptic seizures produce markedly increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) in the brain, and that NO induces Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum via the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which occurs through S-nitrosylation of the intracellular Ca(2+) release channel. Here, we show that through genetic silencing of NO-induced activation of the RyR1 intracellular Ca(2+) release channel, neurons were rescued from seizure-dependent cell death. Furthermore, dantrolene, an inhibitor of RyR1, was protective against neurodegeneration caused by SE. These results demonstrate that NO-induced Ca(2+) release via RyR is involved in SE-induced neurodegeneration, and provide a rationale for the use of RyR1 inhibitors for the prevention of brain damage following SE.","altmetric_jid":"544fc66b2a83ee03188b4567","authors":["Yoshinori Mikami","Kazunori Kanemaru","Yohei Okubo","Takuya Nakaune","Junji Suzuki","Kazuki Shibata","Hiroki Sugiyama","Ryuta Koyama","Takashi Murayama","Akihiro Ito","Toshiko Yamazawa","Yuji Ikegaya","Takashi Sakurai","Nobuhito Saito","Sho Kakizawa","Masamitsu Iino","Mikami, Yoshinori","Kanemaru, Kazunori","Okubo, Yohei","Nakaune, Takuya","Suzuki, Junji","Shibata, Kazuki","Sugiyama, Hiroki","Koyama, Ryuta","Murayama, Takashi","Ito, Akihiro","Yamazawa, Toshiko","Ikegaya, Yuji","Sakurai, Takashi","Saito, Nobuhito","Kakizawa, Sho","Iino, Masamitsu"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ebiom.2016.08.020","endpage":"261","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T08:00:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2352-3964","23523964"],"journal":"EBioMedicine","last_mentioned_on":1481008793,"links":["https:\/\/secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com\/action\/getSharedSiteSession?redirect=http:\/\/www.ebiomedicine.com\/article\/S2352-3964(16)30369-3\/fulltext?sf33446771%3D1&rc=0&code=ebiom-site","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27544065"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ebiomedicine.com\/article\/S2352396416303693\/pdf","pmid":"27544065","pubdate":"2016-08-13T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","startpage":"253","title":"Nitric Oxide-induced Activation of the Type 1 Ryanodine Receptor Is Critical for Epileptic Seizure-induced Neuronal Cell Death","type":"article","volume":"11","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nitric-oxideinduced-activation-type-1-ryanodine-receptor-critical-epileptic-seizureinduced-neuronal"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.1,"score_history":{"1y":3.1,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7851688,"mean":6.6523167403332,"rank":1905109,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":75,"this_scored_higher_than":5928034,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7851688,"percentile":75},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":230305,"mean":12.182462849104,"rank":74078,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":155251,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":230305,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":916,"mean":21.90414863388,"rank":388,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":510,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":916,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":79,"mean":25.587051282051,"rank":35,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":40,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":79,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":6},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":6}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
