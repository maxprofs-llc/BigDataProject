The host institution was the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. An overview of selected presentations and activities is provided. This synopsis is followed by a brief tribute to the recent passing of our esteemed colleague, Dr Irving I. Gottesman. Next, there are summaries of research on monozygotic twinning after single embryo transfer, a twin study of mononucleosis susceptibility, cerebral injury following twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome surgery, and a correction and clarification regarding an article by Segal (2016) on the Brazilian Twin Registry. Human interest articles cover a hospital whose 2015 newborns included 16 pairs of twins born in 1 month, the death of an identical twin playwright, twin themes in advertising, conjoined twins separated in Saudi Arabia, and the dismissed charges of the murder of one twin by her co-twin.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53b3cf058f6100046b4","authors":["Segal, Nancy L"],"doi":"10.1017\/thg.2016.64","endpage":"6","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T12:16:57+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1832-4274","1839-2628"],"journal":"Twin Research & Human Genetics","last_mentioned_on":1471349717,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27524469?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27524469","pubdate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"1","subjects":["geneticsmedical"],"title":"The 2016 Satellite Meeting of the International Society of Twin Studies: An Overview\/Tribute to Irving I.
