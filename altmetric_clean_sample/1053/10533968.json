This report is considered the first in Korea to the best of our knowledge since no cases on silicosis could be reported in this occupation in reviewing various literature sources in Korea. The physician's first impression was lung cancer since the CT findings. However, it turned out to be pneumonia and silicosis. It was eventually diagnosed with silicosis and pneumonia, and tuberculosis. The patient is suffering from various clinical courses for long time.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa66a3cf058f610009409","authors":["Kim, Jung-Il"],"first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T12:22:58+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["2251-6085"],"issue":"7","journal":"Iranian Journal of Public Health","last_mentioned_on":1471350160,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27517002?dopt=Abstract&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27517002?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27517002","pubdate":"2016-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Silicosis with Various Clinical Courses in a Tunnel Worker: A Case Report.","type":"article","volume":"45"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":6245165,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"this_scored_higher_than":1106513,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":13},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233175,"mean":12.389092694726,"rank":166878,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"this_scored_higher_than":35079,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233175,"percentile":15},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253,"mean":3.7092301587302,"rank":130,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"this_scored_higher_than":71,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253,"percentile":28},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":3.8532,"rank":5,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":16}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/librarian123456\/statuses\/765524165973598208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10533968],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T12:22:38+00:00","author":{"name":"urmyuniverse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"librarian123456","tweeter_id":"285939976","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"765524165973598208"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/librarian123456\/statuses\/765524172181086208","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[10533968],"posted_on":"2016-08-16T12:22:40+00:00","author":{"name":"urmyuniverse","image":"https:\/\/abs.twimg.com\/sticky\/default_profile_images\/default_profile_0_normal.png","id_on_source":"librarian123456","tweeter_id":"285939976","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":62},"tweet_id":"765524172181086208"}]}}
