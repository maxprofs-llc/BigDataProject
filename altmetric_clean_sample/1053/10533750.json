The method of co-precipitation produced high crystallinity LDH that is marked by XRD, SEM, TEM and FT-IR. Results showed that 99.8% of Cd(+2) removals were at pH11 and 4h. To get the adsorption isotherms, the concentration of metal ions extending from 6 to 18mg\/L was utilized. Results supported the Langmuir adsorption model. In contrary, the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetics. Interestingly, the prepared LDH shows durable antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative (Proteous vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and MRSA) and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Geotricumcandidum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Zn-Fe LDH varied from 0.49 to 15.60\u03bcg\/mL according to the types of microorganisms. The prepared LDH achieved 90% at pH8.50 which is the pH of wastewater and at the same time exhibited durable antimicrobial activities against MRSA, Gram-negative, Gram-positive and fungi. Results have significant implications in the field of bioremediation of water with little cost, simple operation, high productivity and easiness of the equipment.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5013cf058f610003060","authors":["Moaty, S A Abdel","Farghali, A A","Khaled, Rehab"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.msec.2016.05.110","endpage":"193","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T12:18:31+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["1873-0191","09284931"],"journal":"Materials Science & Engineering: C","last_mentioned_on":1471416674,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27524011?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27524011","pubdate":"2016-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"184","subjects":["biomedicalengineering"],"title":"Preparation, characterization and antimicrobial applications of Zn-Fe LDH against MRSA","type":"article","volume":"68","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/preparation-characterization-antimicrobial-applications-znfe-ldh-against-mrsa"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8229276,"mean":6.9710832737933,"rank":3775848,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":4371282,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8229276,"percentile":53},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233220,"mean":12.388931545028,"rank":102898,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":54,"this_scored_higher_than":126048,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233220,"percentile":54},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":710,"mean":1.6939858956276,"rank":90,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":86,"this_scored_higher_than":613,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":710,"percentile":86},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":0.9125,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":15,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Student  > Ph.
