The purpose of this study was to reveal the organization of melanopsin-immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the Mongolian gerbil retina using immunocytochemistry. Melanopsin-IR cells were primarily located in the ganglion cell layer (GCL; M1c; 75.15%). Many melanopsin-IR cells were also observed in the inner nuclear layer (INL; M1d; 22.28%). The M1c and M1d cell types extended their dendritic processes into the OFF sublayer of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). We rarely observed bistratified cells (M3; 2.56%) with dendrites in both the ON and OFF sublayers of the IPL. Surprisingly, we did not observe M2 cells which are well observed in other rodents. Melanopsin-IR cell somas were small to medium in size and had large dendritic fields. They had 2-5 primary dendrites that branched sparingly and had varicosities. Melanopsin-IR cell density was very low: they comprised 0.49% of the total ganglion cell population. Moreover, none of the melanopsin-IR cells expressed calbindin-D28K, calretinin, or parvalbumin. These results suggest that in the Mongolian gerbil, melanopsin-IR cells are expressed in a very small RGC subpopulation, and are independent of calcium-binding proteins-containing RGCs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50d3cf058f6100031ad","authors":["Jeong, Mi-Jin","Jeon, Chang-Jin"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.neures.2015.06.002","endpage":"16","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T12:29:27+00:00","issns":["1872-8111","01680102"],"journal":"Neuroscience Research","last_mentioned_on":1471350552,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26083722?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"26083722","pubdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"6","subjects":["neurology"],"title":"Localization of melanopsin-immunoreactive cells in the Mongolian gerbil retina","type":"article","volume":"100","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/localization-melanopsinimmunoreactive-cells-mongolian-gerbil-retina"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"mean":6.9683458335668,"rank":7117071,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":233175,"mean":12.389080900958,"rank":198086,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":233175,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":503,"mean":2.3940876494024,"rank":355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":503,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.25,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
