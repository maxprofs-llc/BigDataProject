This update, along with the 2009 publication, is intended to assist the practitioner caring for adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), those on chronic dialysis therapy, or individuals with a kidney transplant. This review highlights key aspects of the 2017 CKD-MBD Guideline Update, with an emphasis on the rationale for the changes made to the original guideline document. Topic areas encompassing updated recommendations include diagnosis of bone abnormalities in CKD-mineral and bone disorder (MBD), treatment of CKD-MBD by targeting phosphate lowering and calcium maintenance, treatment of abnormalities in parathyroid hormone in CKD-MBD, treatment of bone abnormalities by antiresorptives and other osteoporosis therapies, and evaluation and treatment of kidney transplant bone disease.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002fb9","authors":["Markus Ketteler","Geoffrey A.
