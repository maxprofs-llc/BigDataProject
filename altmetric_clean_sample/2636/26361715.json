The raw CT data of the temporal bone was imported into MIMICS v 12 and threshold dissection, region growing and three-dimensional (3D) calculation were used to calculate 3D models. The 3D characteristics of the temporal bone and upper part of mandible were assessed.\nThe tympanic part of the temporal bone was all undeveloped. Of all the patients included, 14 patients were found to have severe maxillofacial malformations. Among them, 2 cases have floating arch, 4 cases have interrupted arch, 5 cases have mandibular processes hypoplasia and 3 cases have interrupted arch combined with severe maxillary malformation. Ten of the 14 patients were suffered from dysplasia of the mastoid part of the temporal bone as well.\nMaxillofacial malformations may sometimes coexist with congenital aural atresia. Otolaryngologists should not neglect the coexisted maxillofacial malformations and give timely referral to maxillofacial surgeons.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b88","authors":["Yaoyao Fu","Chenlong Li","Peidong Dai","Tianyu Zhang"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ijporl.2017.08.004","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T15:53:44+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["01655876","1872-8464"],"journal":"International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology","last_mentioned_on":1506012281,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science?_ob=GatewayURL&_origin=IRSSSEARCH&_method=citationSearch&_piikey=S0165587617303737&_version=1&md5=b3938606e18d54d62380933ee1786053"],"pmid":"28964289","pubdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["otolaryngology","pediatrics"],"title":"Three-dimensional assessment of the temporal bone and mandible deformations in patients with congenital aural atresia","type":"article","volume":"101"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":7298067,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":117097,"mean":11.818798558448,"rank":95587,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":117097,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1919,"mean":1.7454452554745,"rank":1319,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1919,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":68,"mean":0.32238805970149,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":68,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/910532385963462656","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26361715],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T15:53:32+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":306},"tweet_id":"910532385963462656"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/IllingworthInfo\/statuses\/910907648429711361","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26361715],"posted_on":"2017-09-21T16:44:41+00:00","author":{"name":"Illingworth Library","url":"http:\/\/www.sheffieldchildrens.nhs.uk\/our-services\/library","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/667365783845142528\/bfkqalCj_normal.png","description":"We are an NHS library at Sheffield Children\u2019s Hospital specialising in paediatrics and supporting evidence based practice, professional development and research","id_on_source":"IllingworthInfo","tweeter_id":"423358222","geo":{"lt":53.38297,"ln":-1.4659,"country":"GB"},"followers":306},"tweet_id":"910907648429711361"}]}}
