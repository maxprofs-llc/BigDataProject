Basing on transcriptome information, B. balsamifera flavonoids metabolic pathway was analyzed in KEGG data base. The result demonstrated that two metabolic pathways of flavonoids were found in KEGG data base. They were flavonoid biosynthesis pathway (No.ko00941) that contained 32 genes and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathway (No.ko00944) that contained 12 genes. Metabolic pathway of flavonoids in B. balsamifera was similar to that in other plants. Chalcone synthase (CHS) and Chalconeisomerase were much likely to be key enzymes on metabolic pathway of flavonoids in B. balsamifera. HCT was much relevant to biosynthesis of favones.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc89","authors":["Xia, Qi-Feng","Zhao, Zhi","Liu, Hong-Chang","Guan, Ling-Liang","Pang, Yu-Xin"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T16:00:59+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1001-5302"],"issue":"19","journal":"Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi China journal of Chinese materia medica","last_mentioned_on":1505923245,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28925160"],"pmid":"28925160","pubdate":"2016-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["complementarytherapies","pharmacology"],"title":"[Metabolic pathway of flavonoids in Blumea balsamifera].","type":"article","volume":"41"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0.25,"6m":0.25,"3m":0.25,"1m":0.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8440508,"mean":7.0976499018281,"rank":7293230,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8440508,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":113949,"mean":11.844046178959,"rank":93135,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":113949,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":540,"mean":0.7379332096475,"rank":202,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":540,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/transcriptomes\/statuses\/910534202046660613","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26361954],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T16:00:45+00:00","author":{"name":"Transcriptomes","url":"http:\/\/davetang.org\/muse\/2015\/01\/31\/transcriptome-feed-using-r\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/561190761790574593\/2j6U4lnz_normal.png","description":"A transcriptome feed made using #Rstats.
