Following surgery, subfoveal PFCL was retained beneath the retina. Two months later, a macular hole developed and visual acuity decreased to 20\/100, for which a vitrectomy was planned as treatment. However, the macular hole spontaneously closed and visual acuity eventually recovered to 20\/25.\nOur findings indicate that PFCL retained underneath the retina in the macular region can cause a macular hole, though spontaneous discharge may subsequently occur, leading to resolution.","altmetric_jid":"52d3d74b86a348c7778b4c58","authors":["Reiko Tanabu","Yukihiko Suzuki","Kaori Suzuki","Shizuka Takahashi","Mitsuru Nakazawa","Hideyuki Mizutani"],"doi":"10.1007\/s40123-017-0107-5","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T15:31:34+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2193-8245","2193-6528"],"journal":"Ophthalmology and Therapy","last_mentioned_on":1506346507,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007\/s40123-017-0107-5","https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/28933041?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs40123-017-0107-5.pdf","pmid":"28933041","pubdate":"2017-09-20T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Springer Healthcare","title":"Macular Hole Caused by Retained Subfoveal Perfluorocarbon that Subsequently Closed After Its Spontaneous Resolution: A Case Report","type":"article"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":1.25,"6m":1.25,"3m":1.25,"1m":1.25,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8461697,"mean":7.1088157534769,"rank":4275221,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":3968066,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8461697,"percentile":46},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":125139,"mean":11.832906551168,"rank":60691,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":46,"this_scored_higher_than":58576,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":125139,"percentile":46},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98,"mean":2.6427835051546,"rank":37,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":59,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98,"percentile":60},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.8333333333333,"rank":8,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":20}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Ophthal_Therapy\/statuses\/910526807304220672","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26360694],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T15:31:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Ophthalmology Ther","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/springer+healthcare\/journal\/40123","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/870639079968432128\/BkoWxyTU_normal.jpg","description":"PubMed-indexed, rapid publication, peer reviewed #openaccess journal.
