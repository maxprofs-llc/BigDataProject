This article provides a concise and up-to-date review of the literature and covers the latest advances in sperm cryopreservation and its array of clinical indications. Over recent years, the scope of clinical indications used for sperm cryopreservation has expanded widely. Consequently, more patient groups are eligible for sperm freezing, requiring specialist resources and higher running costs. Although sperm cryopreservation prior to cancer therapy is readily available in many countries, referral rates by oncology specialists and levels of patient engagement with cryopreservation services are both reported as low. Furthermore, sperm banking continues to raise ethical issues such whether sperm donation should be anonymous and whether sperm can be utilized posthumously by the surviving partner without consent from the patient. This review focuses on the technological advances and ethical controversies in sperm cryopreservation, and how better understanding of these issues could lead to improved access to fertility preserving treatment for patients.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef652a83ee09648b4f2c","authors":["Hamoun Rozati","Thomas Handley","Channa Jayasena"],"doi":"10.3390\/jcm6090089","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T15:18:51+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["2077-0383"],"issue":"9","journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1505977227,"links":["http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0383\/6\/9\/89"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.mdpi.com\/2077-0383\/6\/9\/89\/pdf","pmid":"28925939","pubdate":"2017-09-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"Process and Pitfalls of Sperm Cryopreservation","type":"article","volume":"6"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0.75,"6m":0.75,"3m":0.75,"1m":0.75,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446126,"mean":7.1012113779909,"rank":6105320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":2037722,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446126,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116888,"mean":11.836995354488,"rank":75342,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":34452,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116888,"percentile":29},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":330,"mean":3.4138176291793,"rank":194,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":99,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":330,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.9785714285714,"rank":9,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":26,"this_scored_higher_than":4,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":26}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/MDPIOpenAccess\/statuses\/910523607243268098","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[26360227],"posted_on":"2017-09-20T15:18:39+00:00","author":{"name":"MDPI","url":"http:\/\/t.co\/RLUmK6xBla","image":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/697440033444335617\/8P9FY71j_normal.png","description":"stands for Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.
