Hence, extensive efforts are concentrated on improving the downstream processing. Especially the development of better affinity chromatography matrices, supporting robust, time- and cost-effective antibody purification, is warranted. With the advances in molecular design and high-throughput screening approaches from chemical and biological combinatorial libraries, novel affinity ligands representing alternatives to bacterial immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding proteins have entered the scene. Here, we review the design, development and properties of diverse classes of alternative antibody-binding ligands, ranging from engineered versions of Ig-binding proteins, to artificial binding proteins, peptides, aptamers, and synthetic small-molecular-weight compounds. We also provide examples of applications for the novel affinity matrices in chromatography and beyond.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa60d3cf058f610006c4a","authors":["Nika Kruljec","Toma\u017e Bratkovi\u010d"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00335","first_seen_on":"2017-09-20T17:50:26+00:00","issns":["1043-1802","1520-4812"],"journal":"Bioconjugate Chemistry","last_mentioned_on":1505992284,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.bioconjchem.7b00335?hootPostID=bc580f47fa5d06d064bf558678ccf497"],"pmid":"28696676","pubdate":"2017-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Organic Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medicinal And Biomolecular Chemistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Chemistry","Chemical Engineering","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Engineering","Physical Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"subjects":["biochemistry"],"title":"Alternative Affinity Ligands for Immunoglobulins","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/alternative-affinity-ligands-immunoglobulins"},"altmetric_score":{"score":2.95,"score_history":{"1y":2.95,"6m":2.95,"3m":2.95,"1m":2.95,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":2.95},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8446283,"mean":7.1010682364064,"rank":3323449,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5110834,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8446283,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":116888,"mean":11.837006048577,"rank":36688,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":79866,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":116888,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":833,"mean":2.4581057692308,"rank":198,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":76,"this_scored_higher_than":634,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":833,"percentile":76},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":1.4178571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":80,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":80}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2,"researcher":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":3,"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
