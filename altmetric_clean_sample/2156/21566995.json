Although xenophagy, a special form of autophagy, eliminates invading GAS in epithelial cells, we found that GAS could survive and multiply in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were competent in starvation-induced autophagy, but failed to form double-membrane structures surrounding GAS, an essential step in xenophagy. This deficiency stemmed from reduced recruitment of ubiquitin and several core autophagy proteins in endothelial cells, as demonstrated by the fact that it could be rescued by exogenous coating of GAS with ubiquitin. The defect was associated with reduced NO-mediated ubiquitin signaling. Therefore, we propose that the lack of efficient clearance of GAS in endothelial cells is caused by their intrinsic inability to target GAS with ubiquitin to promote autophagosome biogenesis for xenophagy.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5123cf058f61000334c","authors":["Shiou-Ling Lu","Tsuyoshi Kawabata","Yi-Lin Cheng","Hiroko Omori","Maho Hamasaki","Tatsuya Kusaba","Ryo Iwamoto","Hirokazu Arimoto","Takeshi Noda","Yee-Shin Lin","Tamotsu Yoshimori"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.ppat.1006444","first_seen_on":"2017-07-06T20:32:26+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"handles":[],"issns":["1553-7374"],"issue":"7","journal":"PLoS Pathogens","last_mentioned_on":1499834111,"links":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1006444","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1006444"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plospathogens\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.ppat.1006444&type=printable","pmid":"28683091","pubdate":"2017-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Public Library of Science","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"startpage":"e1006444","subjects":["microbiology"],"title":"Endothelial cells are intrinsically defective in xenophagy of Streptococcus pyogenes","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/endothelial-cells-intrinsically-defective-xenophagy-streptococcus-pyogenes"},"altmetric_score":{"score":118.25,"score_history":{"1y":118.25,"6m":118.25,"3m":118.25,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":118.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8201580,"mean":6.9400594312327,"rank":66425,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":99,"this_scored_higher_than":8135356,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8201580,"percentile":99},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":191912,"mean":11.654344503442,"rank":3662,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":188247,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":191912,"percentile":98},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4858,"mean":13.431872349187,"rank":73,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":98,"this_scored_higher_than":4785,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4858,"percentile":98},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":160,"mean":27.364037735849,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":95,"this_scored_higher_than":153,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":160,"percentile":95}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3,"researcher":1,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Scientists":1,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1,"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Student  > Ph.
