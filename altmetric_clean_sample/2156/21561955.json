A method is given for the concentration and purification of the soluble specific substance of the pneumococcus. 2. The material obtained by this method is shown to consist mainly of a carbohydrate which appears to be a polysaccharide built up of glucose molecules. 3. Whether the soluble specific substance is actually the polysaccharide, or occurs merely associated with it, is still undecided, although the evidence points in the direction of the former possibility.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["M.
