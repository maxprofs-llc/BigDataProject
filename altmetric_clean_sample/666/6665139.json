PROMIS PF (computer adaptive testing version) and SIS-16 measures were electronically collected on 1,946 ischemic stroke patients seen in a cerebrovascular clinic using an electronic platform from September 12, 2012, to June 16, 2015. Distribution of scores was compared to assess ceiling and floor effects. Correlations with other commonly used functional status scales were performed to assess convergent validity.\nThe SIS-16 and PROMIS PF had a 19.6% and <1% ceiling effect, respectively. Patients completed 16 SIS-16 items and a median of 4 (interquartile range 4-4) PROMIS PF items. Internal consistency of both SIS-16 and PROMIS PF was excellent. The SIS-16 had slightly but significantly higher correlations with the other functional scales than PROMIS PF.\nThe use of PROMIS to obtain electronic patient-reported functional status in an ambulatory setting is feasible. PROMIS PF is an option for measurement of physical function in ischemic stroke patients. It had similar test characteristics as the SIS-16 but with lower patient burden and minimal ceiling effect.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5ea3cf058f610005b59","authors":["Irene L.
