The biological results demonstrated that the majority of the newly designed compounds possessed moderate efficiency in inhibiting the replication of the wild-type (WT) HIV-1 strain (IIIB ) with EC50 values in the range from 0.10 \u03bcM to 5.39 \u03bcM. Among them, 5b1 and 5b3 proved to be the two most active inhibitors against WT HIV-1 with EC50 values of 0.10 \u03bcM and 0.12 \u03bcM, respectively, which were more active than nevirapine (NVP) in the same assay. In addition, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition assay indicated that the representative compound 5b1 displayed affinity to WT HIV-1 RT, and inhibited the activity of RT with an IC50 value superior to the reference drug NVP. Moreover, the preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) and the molecular modeling analysis of these new derivatives are also discussed. This article is protected by copyright.
