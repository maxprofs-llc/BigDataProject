Efficacy (sustained virologic response), annual transition probabilities, disease management costs and utilities were obtained from the literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. Direct costs were considered, expressed in Euros (\u20ac, 2014). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also performed.\nSOF\/Peg-IFN\/RBV therapy at F2-F3 was more effective (19.12 LYGs and 14.14 QALYs) compared to F4. In a cohort of 1,000 patients, SOF\/Peg-IFN\/RBV prevented 66 cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 60 hepatocellular carcinomas and 4 liver transplantations compared with therapy in advanced fibrosis. The total lifetime cost of early therapy (\u20ac43,263) was less than the cost of treatment in the advanced stage (\u20ac49,018). Early therapy was a dominant strategy, more effective and less costly in all simulations. In the PSA analysis, administration of SOF\/PEG-IFN\/RBV at F2-F3 was dominant in all simulations.\nStarting SOF\/Peg-IFN\/RBV therapy at F2-F3, compared with therapy at F4, reduced the incidence of liver disease complications and was associated with cost savings for the Spanish NHS in CHC-GT1 patients.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6193cf058f6100074fa","authors":["Mar\u00eda Buti","Raquel Dom\u00ednguez-Hern\u00e1ndez","Itziar Oyag\u00fcez","Miguel \u00c1ngel Casado","Buti, Mar\u00eda","Dom\u00ednguez-Hern\u00e1ndez, Raquel","Oyag\u00fcez, Itziar","Casado, Miguel \u00c1ngel"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.gastrohep.2016.03.006","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T08:01:46+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"issns":["02105705","0210-5705"],"journal":"Gastroenterolog\u00eda y Hepatolog\u00eda (ScienceDirect)","last_mentioned_on":1460887627,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0210570516300176","http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27084669?dopt=Abstract&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"],"pmid":"27084669","pubdate":"2016-04-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"An\u00e1lisis coste-efectividad de sofosbuvir, interfer\u00f3n pegilado y ribavirina en pacientes con hepatitis cr\u00f3nica por virus C: tratamiento precoz en fases iniciales de fibrosis vs. tratamiento tard\u00edo en fases avanzadas","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/an%C3%A1lisis-costeefectividad-sofosbuvir-interfer%C3%B3n-pegilado-y-ribavirina-en-pacientes-con-hepatitis-cr%C3%B3"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7560115,"mean":6.5270342886323,"rank":3905918,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2116327,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7560115,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269978,"mean":11.373942239524,"rank":146996,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":96020,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269978,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134,"mean":1.5067368421053,"rank":46,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":55,"this_scored_higher_than":74,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134,"percentile":55},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"mean":1.04,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1,"practitioner":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Practitioners (doctors, other healthcare professionals)":1,"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Engineering":1,"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"ES":1},"mendeley":{"CO":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/BibliotecaHUVH\/statuses\/720521320220504064","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[6665898],"posted_on":"2016-04-14T07:57:24+00:00","author":{"name":"BibliotecaHUVH.
