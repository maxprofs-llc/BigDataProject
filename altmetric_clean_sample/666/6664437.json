The superconducting phase forms a dome in the temperature-tuning parameter phase diagram, which is associated with a maximum of the superconducting pairing interaction. Proximity to antiferromagnetism suggests a relation between the disappearance of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. We combine muon spin rotation, neutron scattering, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy techniques to gain access to the magnetic and electronic structure of CeCo(In1-xCdx)5 at different time scales. Different magnetic structures are obtained that indicate a magnetic order of itinerant character, coexisting with bulk superconductivity. The suppression of the antiferromagnetic order appears to be driven by a modification of the bandwidth\/carrier concentration, implying that the electronic structure and consequently the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism is strongly affected by hydrostatic and chemical pressure.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa8213cf058f61000bc80","authors":["Ludovic Howald","Evelyn Stilp","Pierre Dalmas de R\u00e9otier","Alain Yaouanc","St\u00e9phane Raymond","Cinthia Piamonteze","G\u00e9rard Lapertot","Christopher Baines","Hugo Keller"],"doi":"10.1038\/srep12528","first_seen_on":"2016-04-14T06:06:30+00:00","issns":["2045-2322"],"journal":"Scientific Reports","last_mentioned_on":1460613971,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4519736\/"],"pmid":"26224422","pubdate":"2016-04-14T20:15:00+00:00","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Magnetic properties and materials","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Phase transitions and critical phenomena","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Superconducting properties and materials","scheme":"npg"}],"startpage":"12528","subjects":["science"],"title":"Evidence for Coexistence of Bulk Superconductivity and Itinerant Antiferromagnetism in the Heavy Fermion System CeCo(In1\u2212xCdx)5","type":"article","volume":"5","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evidence-coexistence-bulk-superconductivity-itinerant-antiferromagnetism-heavy-fermion-system-cecoin"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7551260,"mean":6.5206857693492,"rank":3900367,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":27,"this_scored_higher_than":2113611,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7551260,"percentile":27},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269823,"mean":11.371891150462,"rank":146882,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":35,"this_scored_higher_than":95908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269823,"percentile":35},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29086,"mean":14.781370465876,"rank":17308,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":8855,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29086,"percentile":30},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2731,"mean":16.293308424908,"rank":1601,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":820,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2731,"percentile":30}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Ph.
