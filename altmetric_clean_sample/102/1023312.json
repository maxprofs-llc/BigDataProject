Preventive measures require awareness of the maternal infection. Although HIV and syphilis testing in Madagascar could be theoretically carried out within the framework of the national pregnancy follow-up scheme, the required test kits are rarely available at peripheral health centres. In this study, we screened blood samples of pregnant Madagascan women for HIV and syphilis seroprevalence to estimate the demand for systemic screening in pregnancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5163cf058f6100037d4","authors":["Frickmann, Hagen","Schwarz, Norbert G.","Girmann, Mirko","Hagen, Ralf M.","Poppert, Sven","Crusius, Sabine","Podbielski, Andreas","Heriniaina, Jean N.","Razafindrabe, Tsiriniaina","Rakotondrainiarivelo, Jean P.","May, J\u00fcrgen","Rakotozandrindrainy, Rapha\u00ebl"],"doi":"10.1111\/tmi.12007","endpage":"39","first_seen_on":"2012-10-25T21:44:53+00:00","issns":["1365-3156","1360-2276"],"issue":"1","journal":"Tropical Medicine & International Health","last_mentioned_on":1353614513,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tmi.12007\/abstract","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tmi.12007\/abstract;jsessionid=2BABE029C2162046A4DD3D3A10B5E559.d03t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+27+October+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/tmi.12007\/pdf","pmid":"23094758","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Blackwell Publishing Ltd","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"startpage":"35","subjects":["publichealth"],"title":"Serological survey of HIV and syphilis in pregnant women in Madagascar","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/serological-survey-hiv-syphilis-pregnant-women-madagascar"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":6656419,"mean":6.1598918598539,"rank":2663236,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":3926083,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":6656419,"percentile":58},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98889,"mean":5.6351347180649,"rank":35885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":62,"this_scored_higher_than":61749,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98889,"percentile":62},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1153,"mean":4.0509913194444,"rank":610,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":45,"this_scored_higher_than":525,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1153,"percentile":45},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":1.4166666666667,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":3},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":3}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":10,"Student  > Doctoral Student":4,"Student  > Ph.
