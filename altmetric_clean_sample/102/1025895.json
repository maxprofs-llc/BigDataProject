Between 2003 and 2006, 143 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 65 years (42-81). Median radiation dose was 62.5\u2009Gy (38-72) with 1.8-2\u2009Gy fraction. Median follow-up was 20.8 months (2.8-92.4). Three and 5-year local recurrence-free survival rates were 58.3% and 50.9%. In univariate analysis, traversable esophageal stricture was a prognostic factor. Three, 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rates were 42.4% and 34.9%. In multivariate analysis, traversable esophageal stricture and stage < IIB were independent prognostic factors. Three and 5-year disease-free survival rates were 30.5% and 25.9%. In multivariate analysis, Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) \u2265 97.5 and performance status (PS) = 0 were independent prognostic factors. Median, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates were 22.1 months, 34.4%, and 19.8%. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were NRI \u2265 97.5 and PS = 0. Median survival times for the NRI classes (no denutrition, moderate and severe denutrition) were 29.5, 19.7, and 12 months (P = 0.0004), respectively. A major impact of baseline NRI was found in terms of survival; it should be included in future prospective trials.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000271e","authors":["Clavier, J.\u2010B.","Antoni, D.","Atlani, D.","Ben Abdelghani, M.","Schumacher, C.","Dufour, P.","Kurtz, J.\u2010E.","Noel, G."],"doi":"10.1111\/j.1442-2050.2012.01441.x","endpage":"567","first_seen_on":"2012-10-27T00:54:37+00:00","issns":["1442-2050","1120-8694"],"issue":"6","journal":"Diseases of the Esophagus","last_mentioned_on":1451606400,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1442-2050.2012.01441.x\/abstract;jsessionid=7573A38F010C48A5AED321FEB1F08254.d01t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+27+October+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance","http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1111\/j.1442-2050.2012.01441.x"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1442-2050.2012.01441.x\/pdf","pmid":"23106980","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"John Wiley and Sons Inc.","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"560","subjects":["gastroenterology"],"title":"Baseline nutritional status is prognostic factor after definitive radiochemotherapy for esophageal cancer","type":"article","volume":"27","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/baseline-nutritional-status-prognostic-factor-after-definitive-radiochemotherapy-esophageal-cancer"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7475617,"mean":6.483348795333,"rank":1617586,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":5845182,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7475617,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":103304,"mean":5.6795938743309,"rank":21715,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":81358,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":103304,"percentile":78},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":251,"mean":1.58568,"rank":22,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":91,"this_scored_higher_than":229,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":251,"percentile":91},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9,"mean":0.41875,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9,"percentile":88}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
