Some study results suggest that methadone can be associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmias, whereas no such risk has been observed for buprenorphine. The aim of this study is to determine the risk of corrected QT interval (QTc) increase among patients treated with these medications in an opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) programme, and to study possible associations between QTc changes and serum concentrations of methadone or buprenorphine.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002732","authors":["Stallvik M","Nordstrand B","Kristensen O","Bathen J","Skogvoll E","Spigset O"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.drugalcdep.2012.09.016","first_seen_on":"2012-10-25T19:16:19+00:00","issns":["0376-8716"],"issue":"","journal":"Drug & Alcohol Dependence","last_mentioned_on":1351192554,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23084592"],"pmid":"23084592","pubdate":"2012-10-23T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["substancerelateddisorders"],"title":"Corrected QT interval during treatment with methadone and buprenorphine-Relation to doses and serum concentrations.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/corrected-qt-interval-during-treatment-methadone-buprenorphinerelation-doses-serum-concentrations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.85,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.85},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629240,"mean":4.9358355666342,"rank":2690355,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":930821,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629240,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78018,"mean":5.198882269249,"rank":50965,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":26936,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78018,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1324,"mean":5.0336976568405,"rank":1073,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":18,"this_scored_higher_than":248,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1324,"percentile":18},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":27,"mean":5.3850769230769,"rank":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":27,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
