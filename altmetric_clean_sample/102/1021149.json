In this study, twenty-eight (28) healthy volunteers were recruited and were randomly divided into Hegu acupoint stimulation group and Non-Hegu stimulation group. All subjects received the same model stimulation of the laser needle for 30\u2009min in right Hegu acupoint and Non-Hegu acupoint, respectively. MBF of left LI4 was measured by the laser Doppler perfusion imaging system. The original data dealt with morlet wavelet analysis and the average amplitude and power spectral density of different frequency intervals was acquired. The results indicated that right Hegu stimulation with the laser needle might result in the increase of left Hegu acupoint MBF. 40\u2009min later after ceased stimulation, the MBF is still increasing significantly, whereas the MBF has no significantly change in Non-Hegu stimulation group. The wavelet analysis result suggested that compared to Non-Hegu stimulation, stimulated to right Hegu acupoint might result in the increase of average amplitude in frequency intervals of 0.0095-0.02\u2009Hz, 0.02-0.06\u2009Hz, and 0.06-0.15\u2009Hz, which might be influenced by the endothelial, neurogenic, and the intrinsic myogenic activity of the vessel wall, respectively.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5243cf058f610003c64","authors":["Guangjun Wang","Yuying Tian","Shuyong Jia","Gerhard Litscher","Weibo Zhang"],"doi":"10.1155\/2012\/103729","first_seen_on":"2012-10-24T21:44:31+00:00","issns":["1741-427X"],"journal":"Evidence-based Complementary & Alternative Medicine (eCAM)","last_mentioned_on":1351115062,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3450915\/"],"pmcid":"PMC3450915","pmid":"23024689","pubdate":"2012-10-24T20:12:00+00:00","publisher":"Hindawi Publishing Corporation","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Complementary And Alternative Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"title":"Evaluate Laser Needle Effect on Blood Perfusion Signals of Contralateral Hegu Acupoint with Wavelet Analysis","type":"article","volume":"2012","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/evaluate-laser-needle-effect-blood-perfusion-signals-contralateral-hegu-acupoint-wavelet-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507280,"mean":5.1336924524522,"rank":2123791,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":49,"this_scored_higher_than":2227037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507280,"percentile":49},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81699,"mean":5.4960012974614,"rank":34970,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"this_scored_higher_than":43503,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81699,"percentile":53},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2941,"mean":3.3559469387755,"rank":1101,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":58,"this_scored_higher_than":1734,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2941,"percentile":58},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":17,"mean":7.286875,"rank":11,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":5,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":17,"percentile":29}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
