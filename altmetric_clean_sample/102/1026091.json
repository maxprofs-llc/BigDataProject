Comparison in Central #Uganda"],"citation":{"abstract":"Social support in addition to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been indicated to be beneficial to person living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) and their families, but very few ART service providers go beyond ART. This study investigates whether receipt of social support in addition to ART for PLWHA makes the households that they reside in better off than households that have PLWHA but are without social support. The analysis uses data comprising of 450 households, which is a sub-sample from the 2010\/2011 Centre for Health Economics Ugandan HIV Survey, a cross-sectional survey of 596 households that was undertaken in Uganda. Data were collected from households of clients that obtained ART from two major ART service providers in Central Uganda; The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) and Ministry of Health (MOH), Uganda. Probit models and ordinary least squares regressions are employed to compare outcomes for individuals from households with a TASO or MOH client. Outcomes for individuals in households with a TASO PLWHA are hypothesised to be superior to those from households with an MOH PLWHA given that the benefits from social support accrue not only to the PLWHA but also to the household and communities they belong to. The results confirm that individuals from a household with a TASO PLWHA are better off in terms of physical health outcomes including better productivity as non-wage labour hours and having more cash in hand and having savings. The findings highlight the importance of additional support to HIV\/AIDS clients and have implications for supplementation of ART service provision with other services to maximise the benefits from ART in resource constrained countries like Uganda.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4da3cf058f61000156b","authors":["Abimanyi-Ochom J","Lorgelly P","Hollingsworth B","Inder B"],"doi":"10.1080\/09540121.2012.726337","endpage":"626","first_seen_on":"2012-10-27T06:50:32+00:00","issns":["0954-0121","1360-0451"],"issue":"5","journal":"AIDS Care","last_mentioned_on":1352639149,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23062016"],"pmid":"23062016","pubdate":"2012-10-17T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Routledge (4 Park Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxfordshire OX14 4RN, United Kingdom)","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"startpage":"619","subjects":["acquiredimmunodeficiencysyndrome"],"title":"Does social support in addition to ART make a difference?
