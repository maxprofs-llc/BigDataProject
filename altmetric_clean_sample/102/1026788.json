MDCT may detect premature, non-obstructive atherosclerotic lesions which otherwise would have not been detected upon functional cardiac imaging tests. Currently, there is scarce data regarding the clinical significance of these lesions. The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyse the intermediate term outcome of patients admitted to chest pain unit (CPU) with findings of non-obstructive CAD upon MDCT. Method and results The study comprised 444 patients admitted to the CPU at Sheba Medical Center and underwent evaluation by MDCT for complaints of acute chest pain. Studies were classified as: normal; non-obstructive CAD (defined as any narrowing <50% diameter stenosis); obstructive CAD (narrowing of \u2265 50% diameter stenosis); or non-diagnostic. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 1 year and outcomes were compared between the non-obstructive (n = 115) and the normal (n = 266) MDCT groups in regard to MACE [coronary revascularization, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and death]. Comparing the groups, those with non-obstructive CAD were older, more likely to be males, and dyslipidaemic. During an intermediate term follow-up (2.5 \u00b1 0.4 years) MACE was equally low between the two groups (1% for both groups; P = 0.9).","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6173cf058f610007347","authors":["Segev A","Beigel R","Goitein O","Brosh S","Oiero D","Konen E","Hod H","Matetzky S"],"doi":"10.1093\/ejechocard\/jer189","first_seen_on":"2012-10-27T16:55:07+00:00","issns":["1525-2167"],"issue":"","journal":"European Journal of Echocardiography","last_mentioned_on":1351356902,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22001192?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22001192","pubdate":"2011-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cardiovascular Medicine And Haematology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["diagnosticimaging","cardiology"],"title":"Non-obstructive coronary artery disease upon multi-detector computed tomography in patients presenting with acute chest pain-Results of an intermediate term follow-up.","type":"article","volume":"","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonobstructive-coronary-artery-disease-upon-multidetector-computed-tomography-patients-presenting-ac-1"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3632140,"mean":4.9249633348334,"rank":2898394,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":81072,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3632140,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77999,"mean":5.1690014872176,"rank":58102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77999,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":92,"mean":1.0421538461538,"rank":44,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":92,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":3},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2,"Psychology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/cardiacimaging\/statuses\/262235969967779840","license":"public","citation_ids":[1026788],"posted_on":"2012-10-27T16:55:02+00:00","author":{"name":"Cardiac","url":"http:\/\/j.gs\/1GEa","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2406742261\/x3ds44aipz7rb9caz5p1_normal.jpeg","description":"Cardiovascular imaging and heart health.","id_on_source":"cardiacimaging","tweeter_id":"64524440","geo":{"lt":36.17497,"ln":-115.13722,"country":"US"},"followers":7862},"tweet_id":"262235969967779840"}]}}
