The observations point to the existence of several agglutinable factors for which no agglutinins are demonstrable in normal human sera. In view of the latter circumstance the results reported do not imply any change in the scheme of the four blood groups. The body of serological evidence leads to the inference of a high degree of biochemical differentiation among individuals.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6233cf058f610007c77","authors":["Philip Levine"],"doi":"10.1084\/jem.47.5.757","first_seen_on":"2012-10-26T21:12:28+00:00","issns":["1540-9538","0022-1007"],"issue":"5","journal":"The Journal of Experimental Medicine","last_mentioned_on":1434375197,"links":["http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/47\/5\/757.full.pdf","http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/47\/5\/757.abstract?sid=3d68e143-24e9-4529-b06c-33e02bf6f20b"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/47\/5\/757.full.pdf","pmcid":"PMC2131399","pmid":"19869442","pubdate":"1928-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Rockefeller Univ Press","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology"],"subjects":["medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"ON INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN HUMAN BLOOD","type":"article","volume":"47","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/individual-differences-human-blood-5"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5234463,"mean":6.1680605028774,"rank":3465531,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":1551261,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5234463,"percentile":29},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85808,"mean":5.8473314764529,"rank":52254,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":29635,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85808,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2882,"mean":5.0734376952447,"rank":2608,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":8,"this_scored_higher_than":232,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2882,"percentile":8},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"mean":2.1541666666667,"rank":10,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":3,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":13,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"US":1}}},"posts":{"facebook":[{"title":"http:\/\/jem.rupress.org\/content\/47\/5\/757.full.pdf","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=378164518931687&id=144427068930114","citation_ids":[1025598],"posted_on":"2012-10-26T14:56:25+00:00","summary":"Landsteiner and Levine\u2019s initial report of anti-M in 1927 was very brief \u2013 just three sentences long. \r\nBut this longer report followed in 1928 and included serological details for M, N and P. \r\nLandsteiner K, Levine P.
