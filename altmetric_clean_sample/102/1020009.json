The results of studies related to the impact of age on pain sensitivity have ranged from increased to decreased sensitivity to no change. Examining the design of these studies one discovers that cross-sectional designs using animals of different ages have been used to evaluate age-related effects in normal animals as well as animals with inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. In the present review a summary of these studies is presented along with a discussion of potential mechanisms responsible for changes that have been described.
