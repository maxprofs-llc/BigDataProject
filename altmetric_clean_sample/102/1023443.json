Later in life, a pathological recapitulation of this process takes place in atherosclerotic lesions, when vascular mesenchymal cells organize into trabecular bone tissue within the artery wall. Here we show that multipotential adult vascular mesenchymal cells self-organize in vitro into patterns that are predicted by a mathematical model based on molecular morphogens interacting in a reaction-diffusion process. We identify activator and inhibitor morphogens for stripe, spot, and labyrinthine patterns and confirm the model predictions in vitro. Thus, reaction-diffusion principles may play a significant role in morphogenetic processes in adult mesenchymal cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2004PNAS..101.9247G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Alan Garfinkel","Yin Tintut","Danny Petrasek","Kristina Bostr\u00f6m","Linda L.
