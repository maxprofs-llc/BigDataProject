It is usually asymptomatic but symptoms could occur with relatively poor local drainage. There are a few cases of lung cancer within the tracheal bronchus reported in the literature; however, none of them were reported to be metachronous. A metachronous tumor is a second primary malignancy diagnosed >6 months after the diagnosis of the index tumor. We present a case of a squamous cell carcinoma originating in a tracheal bronchus of a 53-year-old patient previously diagnosed with a supraglottic malignancy.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6223cf058f610007bab","doi":"10.1097\/lbr.0b013e31826c64d4","first_seen_on":"2012-10-29T16:10:49+00:00","issns":["1944-6586"],"issue":"4","journal":"Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology","last_mentioned_on":1351527038,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/bronchology\/Abstract\/2012\/10000\/Tracheal_Bronchus_With_Metachronous_Tumor.19.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/bronchology\/2012\/10000\/Tracheal_Bronchus_With_Metachronous_Tumor.19.pdf","pmid":"23207541","pubdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","startpage":"343","subjects":["pulmonarymedicine"],"title":"Tracheal Bronchus With Metachronous Tumor","type":"article","volume":"19","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tracheal-bronchus-metachronous-tumor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507144,"mean":5.1294364809111,"rank":3081176,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":21,"this_scored_higher_than":962129,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507144,"percentile":21},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":82389,"mean":5.4320257804535,"rank":53820,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":22,"this_scored_higher_than":18149,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":82389,"percentile":22},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":576,"mean":0.99114434782609,"rank":335,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":9,"this_scored_higher_than":57,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":576,"percentile":9},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":20,"mean":1.0710526315789,"rank":14,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":5,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":20,"percentile":5}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Ph.
