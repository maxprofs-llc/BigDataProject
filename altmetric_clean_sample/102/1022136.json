The prevalence of this lesion varies depending on the type and quality of radiographic exposure and age of patients used for assessment. The aetiology of pre-eruptive intra-coronal radiolucent lesions is not fully understood, but published clinical and histological evidence suggest that these lesions are resorptive in nature. Issues around the diagnosis, treatment planning and clinical management of this lesion are explored using previously unreported cases.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5fc3cf058f610005f3c","authors":["Counihan KP","O'Connell AC"],"first_seen_on":"2012-10-25T10:31:53+00:00","issns":[],"issue":"4","journal":"European Archives of Paediatric Dentistry","last_mentioned_on":1351161106,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22883363?dopt=Abstract"],"pmid":"22883363","pubdate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["dentistry","pediatrics"],"title":"Case Report: Pre-eruptive intra-coronal radiolucencies revisited.","type":"article","volume":"13","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/case-report-preeruptive-intracoronal-radiolucencies-revisited"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.5},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5037615,"mean":5.964909370187,"rank":3557065,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":16,"this_scored_higher_than":833135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5037615,"percentile":16},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":84758,"mean":5.7892862654413,"rank":55624,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":17,"this_scored_higher_than":14920,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":84758,"percentile":17},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":94,"mean":1.9029677419355,"rank":54,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":29,"this_scored_higher_than":28,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":94,"percentile":29},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"mean":0.95,"rank":2,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4,"percentile":25}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":1,"Student  > Ph.
