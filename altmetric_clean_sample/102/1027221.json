Organizations can identify barriers, emphasize and leverage their strengths, and initiate activities that promote health literacy-related practices. The current project employed an open-ended approach to conduct a needs assessment of rural federally qualified health center clinics. Using customized assessment tools, the collaborators were then able to determine priorities for changing organizational structures and policies in order to support continued health literacy efforts. Six domains of organizational health literacy were measured with three methods: environmental assessments, patient interviews, and key informant interviews with staff and providers. Subsequent strategic planning was conducted by collaborators from the academic and clinic teams and resulted in a focused, context-appropriate action plan. The needs assessment revealed several gaps in organizational health literacy practices, such as low awareness of health literacy within the organization and variation in perceived values of protocols, interstaff communication, and patient communication. Facilitators included high employee morale and patient satisfaction. The resulting targeted action plan considered the organization's culture as revealed in the interviews, informing a collaborative process well suited to improving organizational structures and systems to support health literacy best practices. The customized needs assessment contributed to an ongoing collaborative process to implement organizational changes that aided in addressing health literacy needs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d93cf058f6100013f4","authors":["Weaver, Nancy L.","Weaver NL","Wray RJ","Zellin S","Gautam K","Jupka K"],"doi":"10.1080\/10810730.2012.714442","first_seen_on":"2012-10-28T00:36:42+00:00","issns":["1081-0730","1087-0415"],"issue":"sup3","journal":"Journal of Health Communication","last_mentioned_on":1351384586,"links":["http:\/\/www.ingentaconnect.com\/content\/tandf\/uhcm\/2012\/00000017\/A00301s3\/art00007","http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/10810730.2012.714442"],"pmid":"23030561","pubdate":"2012-10-18T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Library And Information Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Communication And Media Studies","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","healthservices"],"title":"Advancing Organizational Health Literacy in Health Care Organizations Serving High-Needs Populations: A Case Study","type":"article","volume":"17 Suppl 3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/advancing-organizational-health-literacy-health-care-organizations-serving-highneeds-populations-cas-4"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5475024,"mean":6.3594044857891,"rank":4554934,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5475024,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":86868,"mean":5.9006215939309,"rank":70858,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":86868,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":549,"mean":7.9768649635037,"rank":526,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":549,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":30,"mean":6.3881379310345,"rank":29,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":30,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Ph.
