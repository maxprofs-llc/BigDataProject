Nonviral-Mediated Hepatic Expression of IGF-I Increases Treg Levels Suppresses Autoimmune Diabetes in Mice","Type 1 db: Nonviral-mediated hepatic expression of IGF-I increases treg levels suppresses autoimmune diabetes in mice"],"citation":{"abstract":"In type 1 diabetes, loss of tolerance to \u03b2-cell antigens results in T-cell-dependent autoimmune destruction of \u03b2 cells. The abrogation of autoreactive T-cell responses is a prerequisite to achieve long-lasting correction of the disease. The liver has unique immunomodulatory properties and hepatic gene transfer results in tolerance induction and suppression of autoimmune diseases, in part by regulatory T-cell (Treg) activation. Hence, the liver could be manipulated to treat or prevent diabetes onset through expression of key genes. IGF-I may be an immunomodulatory candidate because it prevents autoimmune diabetes when expressed in \u03b2 cells or subcutaneously injected. Here, we demonstrate that transient, plasmid-derived IGF-I expression in mouse liver suppressed autoimmune diabetes progression. Suppression was associated with decreased islet inflammation and \u03b2-cell apoptosis, increased \u03b2-cell replication, and normalized \u03b2-cell mass. Permanent protection depended on exogenous IGF-I expression in liver nonparenchymal cells and was associated with increased percentage of intrapancreatic Tregs. Importantly, Treg depletion completely abolished IGF-I-mediated protection confirming the therapeutic potential of these cells in autoimmune diabetes. This study demonstrates that a nonviral gene therapy combining the immunological properties of the liver and IGF-I could be beneficial in the treatment of the disease.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026f7","authors":["Fatima Bosch"],"doi":"10.2337\/db11-1776","first_seen_on":"2012-10-26T15:49:11+00:00","issns":["1939-327X"],"journal":"Diabetes","last_mentioned_on":1363873811,"links":["http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/21\/db11-1776.abstract"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/diabetes.diabetesjournals.org\/content\/early\/2012\/10\/21\/db11-1776.full.pdf","pmid":"23099863","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["endocrinology"],"title":"Nonviral-Mediated Hepatic Expression of IGF-I Increases Treg Levels and Suppresses Autoimmune Diabetes in Mice","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/nonviralmediated-hepatic-expression-igfi-increases-treg-levels-suppresses-autoimmune-diabetes-mice"},"altmetric_score":{"score":4.7,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":4.7},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":4507211,"mean":5.1317416223105,"rank":793019,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":3709900,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":4507211,"percentile":82},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":81662,"mean":5.4822517970635,"rank":14674,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":66908,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":81662,"percentile":81},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3189,"mean":4.5593632371393,"rank":565,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":82,"this_scored_higher_than":2620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3189,"percentile":82},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":16,"mean":3.1565333333333,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":81,"this_scored_higher_than":13,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":16,"percentile":81}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":4,"science_communicator":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":4,"Science communicators (journalists, bloggers, editors)":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Librarian":2,"Researcher":6,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.
