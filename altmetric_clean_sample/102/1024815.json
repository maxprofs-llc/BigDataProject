Nanotechnology provides an effective method to improve the water solubility of hydrophobic drug. In this work, curcumin was encapsulated into monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) micelles through a single-step nano-precipitation method, creating curcumin-loaded MPEG-PCL (Cur\/MPEG-PCL) micelles. These Cur\/MPEG-PCL micelles were monodisperse (PDI = 0.097 \u00b1 0.011) with a mean particle size of 27.3 \u00b1 1.3 nm, good re-solubility after freeze-drying, an encapsulation efficiency of 99.16 \u00b1 1.02%, and drug loading of 12.95 \u00b1 0.15%. Moreover, these micelles were prepared by a simple and reproducible procedure, making them potentially suitable for scale-up. Curcumin was molecularly dispersed in the PCL core of MPEG-PCL micelles, and could be slow-released in vitro. Encapsulation of curcumin in MPEG-PCL micelles improved the t(1\/2) and AUC of curcumin in vivo. As well as free curcumin, Cur\/MPEG-PCL micelles efficiently inhibited the angiogenesis on transgenic zebrafish model. In an alginate-encapsulated cancer cell assay, intravenous application of Cur\/MPEG-PCL micelles more efficiently inhibited the tumor cell-induced angiogenesis in vivo than that of free curcumin. MPEG-PCL micelle-encapsulated curcumin maintained the cytotoxicity of curcumin on C-26 colon carcinoma cells in vitro. Intravenous application of Cur\/MPEG-PCL micelle (25 mg kg(-1) curcumin) inhibited the growth of subcutaneous C-26 colon carcinoma in vivo (p < 0.01), and induced a stronger anticancer effect than that of free curcumin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, Cur\/MPEG-PCL micelles are an excellent intravenously injectable aqueous formulation of curcumin; this formulation can inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma through inhibiting angiogenesis and directly killing cancer cells.","abstract_source":"pubmed","ads_id":"2011Nanos...3.1558G","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62e3cf058f61000823d","authors":["MaLing Gou","Ke Men","HuaShan Shi","MingLi Xiang","Juan Zhang","Jia Song","JianLin Long","Yang Wan","Feng Luo","Xia Zhao","ZhiYong Qian"],"doi":"10.1039\/c0nr00758g","first_seen_on":"2012-10-26T14:55:05+00:00","issns":["2040-3372"],"issue":"4","journal":"Nanoscale","last_mentioned_on":1351263284,"links":["http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlelanding\/2011\/nr\/c0nr00758g"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pubs.rsc.org\/en\/content\/articlepdf\/2011\/nr\/c0nr00758g","pmid":"21283869","pubdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"The Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Physical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"startpage":"1558","subjects":["nanotechnology"],"title":"Curcumin-loaded biodegradable polymeric micelles for colon cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo","type":"article","volume":"3","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/curcuminloaded-biodegradable-polymeric-micelles-colon-cancer-therapy-vitro-vivo"},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":1},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3629728,"mean":4.9326084606411,"rank":2015857,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":940492,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3629728,"percentile":25},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":78011,"mean":5.1743744648122,"rank":37885,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":27097,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":78011,"percentile":34},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":953,"mean":3.6271596638655,"rank":316,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":48,"this_scored_higher_than":460,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":953,"percentile":48},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":18,"mean":1.7558823529412,"rank":6,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":66,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":18,"percentile":66}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":8,"Student  > Doctoral Student":3,"Student  > Ph.
