This relies on Nodal activity, but different vertebrates differ in how this activity is positioned. In chick, the earliest known asymmetry is posterior expression of the TGF\u03b2-related factor Vg1, close to the future Nodal expression domain. Here we show that the transcription factor Gata2 is expressed anteriorly before this stage. Gata2 influences the site of primitive streak formation and its role is independent from, and upstream of, Vg1 and Wnt. However, although Vg1 is required for streak formation, Gata2 does not act as an absolute anterior specifier, but provides an anterior bias. These findings point to previously unsuspected global determinants of polarity of the early amniote embryo.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f6100026e9","authors":["Claudio D.
