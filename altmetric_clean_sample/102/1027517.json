This joint position statement aims to provide professionals with up-to-date information regarding the identification of different exercise intensity domains, the methods of direct and indirect determination of exercise intensity for both continuous and interval aerobic training, the effects of the use of different exercise protocols on exercise intensity prescription and the indications for recommended exercise training prescription in specific cardiac patients' groups. The importance of functional evaluation through exercise testing prior to starting an aerobic training program is strongly emphasized, and ramp incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test, when available, is proposed as the gold standard for a physiologically comprehensive exercise intensity assessment and prescription. This may allow a shift from a 'range-based' to a 'threshold-based' aerobic exercise intensity prescription, which, combined with thorough clinical evaluation and exercise-related risk assessment, could maximize the benefits obtainable by the use of aerobic exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005a04","authors":["Mezzani A","Hamm LF","Jones AM","McBride PE","Moholdt T","Stone JA","Urhausen A","Williams MA","Mezzani, Alessandro","Hamm, Larry F","Jones, Andrew M","McBride, Patrick E","Moholdt, Trine","Stone, James A","Urhausen, Axel","Williams, Mark A",", ","Alessandro Mezzani","Larry F.
