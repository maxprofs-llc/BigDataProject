In the GABA\u03c11 subunit knock out mouse, inhibition mediated by this receptor is totally eliminated, showing its role in neural transmission in retina. GABA\u03c11 mRNA is expressed in mouse retina after post-natal day 7, but little is known about its transcriptional regulation. To identify the GABA\u03c11 promoter, in silico analyses were performed and indicated that a 0.290-kb fragment, flanking the 5'-end of the GABA\u03c11 gene, includes putative transcription factor-binding sites, two Inr elements, and lacks a TATA-box. A rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) assay showed three transcription start sites (TSS) clustered in the first exon. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that a 0.232-kb fragment upstream from the ATG is the minimal promoter in transfected cell lines and in vitro electroporated retinae. The second Inr and AP1 site are important to activate transcription in secretin tumor cells (STC-1) and retina. Finally, the 0.232-kb fragment drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression to the inner nuclear layer, where bipolar cells are present. This first work paves the way for further studies of molecular elements that control GABA\u03c11 transcription and regulate its expression during retinal development.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e72","authors":["Machuca\u2010Parra, Arturo Israel","Miledi, Ricardo","Mart\u00ednez\u2010Torres, Ata\u00falfo"],"doi":"10.1111\/jnc.12067","endpage":"188","first_seen_on":"2012-10-26T01:24:27+00:00","issns":["1471-4159","0022-3042"],"issue":"2","journal":"Journal of Neurochemistry","last_mentioned_on":1362874277,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.12067\/abstract;jsessionid=EDBC055D3737D99BEE61C487B3CB6F3C.d03t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+on+27+October+from+10%3A00-12%3A00+BST+%2805%3A00-07%3A00+EDT%29+for+essential+maintenance"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/jnc.12067\/pdf","pmid":"23106649","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Neuroscience"],"startpage":"175","subjects":["chemistry","neurology"],"title":"Identification of the minimal promoter for specific expression of the GABA1 receptor in retinal bipolar cells","type":"article","volume":"124","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-minimal-promoter-specific-expression-gaba1-receptor-retinal-bipolar-cells"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3619417,"mean":4.9285227185855,"rank":2903859,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":71690,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3619417,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":77941,"mean":5.1921924044136,"rank":58320,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":243,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":77941,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1755,"mean":2.1788734321551,"rank":1306,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":7,"this_scored_higher_than":137,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1755,"percentile":7},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":14,"mean":1.9813846153846,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":14,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":1},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":1}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Other":1,"Student  > Master":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":1,"Neuroscience":1,"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":2}}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Bipolar_Blogs\/statuses\/261639372166811648","license":"public","citation_ids":[1023643],"posted_on":"2012-10-26T01:24:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Bipolar Blogs","url":"http:\/\/www.pathsoflight.us\/bipolarwinds","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3605210516\/e9da8d6cabf3994c6ec4ab42483804b9_normal.png","description":"Blogs & news from the minds of people living with bipolar and researchers.
