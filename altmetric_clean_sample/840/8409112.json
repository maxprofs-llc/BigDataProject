The objective was to evaluate contact sensitization in children with suspected contact dermatitis, the relationship with atopic dermatitis (AD), and the most common allergens.\nThe same team patch tested 2,614 children younger than 11 years old with a standard series of 30 allergens.\nA total of 1220 children (46.7%) developed at least one positive reaction, 606 of which were clinically relevant (49.7%). The most frequent reactions were to nickel sulfate (22.7%), cobalt chloride (11.1%), potassium dichromate (9.9%), neomycin sulfate (5.2%), thimerosal (4.2%), cocamidopropyl betaine (3.4%), and methylchloroisothiazolinone\/methylisothiazolinone (3.2%). The prevalence of contact sensitization was similar in children with (47.3%) and without (46.1%) AD. Children with AD had a higher prevalence of positive reactions to potassium dichromate (p < 0.001), Compositae mix (p = 0.01), and disperse blue (p = 0.03).\nContact sensitization is quite common in young children. This study adds some information on the most common contact allergens. A similar prevalence of positive patch test reactions was found in children with and without AD, but children with AD had a greater prevalence of positive patch test reactions to potassium dichromate, Compositae mix, and disperse blue.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032ac","authors":["Belloni Fortina, Anna","Fontana, Elena","Peserico, Andrea"],"doi":"10.1111\/pde.12873","endpage":"404","first_seen_on":"2016-06-01T05:39:41+00:00","funders":["niehs"],"isbns":[],"issns":["1525-1470"],"issue":"4","journal":"Pediatric Dermatology","last_mentioned_on":1464769371,"links":["http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/resolve\/doi?DOI=10.1111\/pde.12873#.V0508Mp01Yw.twitter","http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.12873\/abstract?campaign=wolsavedsearch"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/pde.12873\/pdf","pmid":"27241536","pubdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"399","subjects":["dermatology","pediatrics"],"title":"Contact Sensitization in Children: A Retrospective Study of 2,614 Children from a Single Center","type":"article","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/contact-sensitization-children-retrospective-study-2614-children-single-center"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.75,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.75},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":7842728,"mean":6.6456077751988,"rank":5669350,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"this_scored_higher_than":1894536,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":7842728,"percentile":24},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":269346,"mean":11.365280677198,"rank":172665,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":30,"this_scored_higher_than":81191,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":269346,"percentile":30},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":892,"mean":3.5361481481481,"rank":603,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"this_scored_higher_than":227,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":892,"percentile":25},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":29,"mean":2.4178571428571,"rank":18,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"this_scored_higher_than":10,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":29,"percentile":34}}},"demographics":{"poster_types":{"member_of_the_public":2},"users":{"twitter":{"cohorts":{"Members of the public":2}},"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1,"Student  > Bachelor":1},"by_discipline":{"Medicine and Dentistry":2}}},"geo":{"twitter":{"GB":1}}},"posts":{"twitter":[{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/eczemasupport\/statuses\/737881201726390272","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8409112],"posted_on":"2016-06-01T05:39:22+00:00","author":{"name":"Nottingham Eczema","url":"http:\/\/www.nottinghameczema.org.uk","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/522162557\/N_normal.jpg","description":"Supporting carers of children with eczema","id_on_source":"eczemasupport","tweeter_id":"21676274","geo":{"lt":52.9536,"ln":-1.15047,"country":"GB"},"followers":6263},"tweet_id":"737881201726390272"},{"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Chimienaturels\/statuses\/737922344606412800","license":"gnip","citation_ids":[8409112],"posted_on":"2016-06-01T08:22:51+00:00","author":{"name":"Ga\u00eblle Queignec","url":"https:\/\/fr.linkedin.com\/in\/gaellequeignec","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/793009376206487552\/OVI-EP8s_normal.jpg","description":"Enchant\u00e9s par #cosm\u00e9tiques #cosmetics #parfums #ingredients  #biotech #chimie #sciences ?Partageons inspiration #innovations #veille  #r\u00e9glementations #job #PhD","id_on_source":"Chimienaturels","tweeter_id":"40194332","geo":{"lt":null,"ln":null},"followers":590},"tweet_id":"737922344606412800"}]}}
