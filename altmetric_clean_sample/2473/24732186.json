Using the orthogonal fragment screening methods of native state mass spectrometry and surface plasmon resonance a 3-unsubstituted-2,4-oxazolidinedione fragment was found to have low micromolar binding affinity to the zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase II (CA II). This affinity approached that of fragment sized primary benzene sulfonamides, the classical zinc binding group found in most CA II inhibitors. Protein X-ray crystallography established that 3-unsubstituted-2,4-oxazolidinediones bound to CA II via an interaction of the acidic ring nitrogen with the CA II active site zinc, as well as a hydrogen bond between the oxazolidinedione ring oxygen and the CA II protein backbone. Furthermore, 3-unsubstituted-2,4-oxazolidinediones appear to be a viable starting point for the development of an alternative class of CA inhibitor, wherein the medicinal chemistry pedigree of primary sulfonamides has dominated for several decades.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002e47","authors":["Panagiotis K.
