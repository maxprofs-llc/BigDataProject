Particularly vibrational excitation of small molecules colliding with hot light atoms, via a metastable complex formation, has shown to be an efficient manner of enhancing reactivity. A quasi-classical trajectory study of translation-to-vibration energy transfer (T-V ET) in collisions of hyperthermal H((2)S) atoms with SO2(X\u0303(1)A(')) molecules is presented here. For such a study, a double many-body expansion potential energy surface previously reported for HSO2((2)A) is used. This work was motivated by recent experiments by Ma et al. studying collisions of H + SO2 at the translational energy of 59\u2009kcal\/mol [J. Ma et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 040702 (2016)]. Calculations reproduce the experimental evidence that during majority of inelastic non-reactive collision processes, there is a metastable intermediate formation (HOSO or HSO2). Nevertheless, the analysis of the trajectories shows that there are two distinct mechanisms in the T-V ET process: direct and indirect. Direct T-V processes are responsible for the high population of SO2 with relatively low vibrational excitation energy, while indirect ones dominate the conversion from translational energy to high values of the vibrational counterpart.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f03cf058f610002cee","authors":["Ramon S. da Silva","Juan D.
