The drug displays similar affinity (IC50 = 570 nM for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors labeled for 3H-rauwolscine. mCPP is less potent at alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (IC50 values 2500-24,000 nM). mCPP is inactive at both benzodiazepine receptors and the 5-HT uptake sites at concentrations below 100,000 nM. These data demonstrate that mCPP displays similar potency for multiple neurotransmitter receptor binding sites in human brain.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f6100023d9","authors":["Hamik, A","Peroutka, S J"],"first_seen_on":"2017-09-04T00:37:21+00:00","issns":["0006-3223"],"issue":"5","journal":"Biological Psychiatry","last_mentioned_on":1505168030,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/2537663"],"pmid":"2537663","pubdate":"1989-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["psychophysiology","psychiatry"],"title":"1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) interactions with neurotransmitter receptors in the human brain.","type":"article","volume":"25","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/1mchlorophenylpiperazine-mcpp-interactions-neurotransmitter-receptors-human-brain"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":3,"3m":3,"1m":3,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":8397236,"mean":7.0723276090205,"rank":2155049,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":60,"this_scored_higher_than":5095221,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":8397236,"percentile":60},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":134574,"mean":12.051316579106,"rank":41856,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":91844,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":134574,"percentile":68},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":2980,"mean":13.130494125545,"rank":1282,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":38,"this_scored_higher_than":1145,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":2980,"percentile":38},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":42,"mean":8.6080487804878,"rank":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":59,"this_scored_higher_than":25,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":42,"percentile":59}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.
